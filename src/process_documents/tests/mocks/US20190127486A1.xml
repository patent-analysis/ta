These enzymes contain a conserved catalytic domain in which a zinc atom is coordinated by three histidine residues. Over 20 members of this family are known, organized into a number of groups including collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, matrilysins, enamelysins and membrane MMPs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">MMP2 and MMP9 belong to the gelatinase group of matrix metalloproteinases. Besides containing signal peptide, propeptide, catalytic, zinc-binding and heamopexin-like domains common to most MMPs, the gelatinases also contain a plurality of fibronectin-like domains and an O-glycosylated domain.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">MMPs are associated with a number of diseases. However, available inhibitors MMPs have been unsuccessful, in part due to toxicity and lack of efficacy. Therefore, there is a need for specific and effective MMP inhibitors.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0006">The present disclosure provides compositions and methods of use involving binding proteins, e.g., antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, that bind to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) protein (also known as gelatinase-B). The binding proteins typically are antibodies or fragments (e.g., antigen-binding fragments) thereof and typically contain an immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain (or functional fragment thereof) and an Ig light chain (or functional fragment thereof). The heavy chain is typically an IgG, typically a human IgG, such as an IgG1 or IgG4, or other IgG such as an IgG2, or modified version thereof. The light chain typically is a kappa chain.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Among the MMP9 binding proteins, e.g., antibodies, are those that bind specifically to MMP9 and not to other matrix metalloproteinases. Such MMP9 binding proteins find use in applications in which it is necessary or desirable to obtain specific modulation (e.g., inhibition) of MMP9, e.g., without directly affecting the activity of other matrix metalloproteinases. Thus, in certain embodiments of the present disclosure an anti-MMP9 antibody or fragment thereof is a specific inhibitor of the activity of MMP9. In some aspects, the MMP9 binding proteins disclosed herein will be useful for inhibition of MMP9 while allowing normal function of other, related matrix metalloproteinases.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">The antibodies and fragments can be described with reference to their amino acid sequences or portions thereof, and/or various functions such as binding specificity to MMP9 or particular epitopes thereof or the ability to compete for binding to epitopes on MMP9 with particular antibodies, and/or activity, such as the ability to inhibit MMP9, e.g., non-competitively.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">The antibodies and fragments include those having heavy chain variable (WI) region having a heavy chain complementary determining region (CDR) with an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 43, SEQ ID NO: 14, or SEQ ID NO: 15; those having a light chain variable (V U) region having a light chain complementary determining region (CDR) with an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, or SEQ ID NO: 18.

Such methods can be carried out, for example, by contacting the test sample with an antibody or fragment as described herein (such as any of the above-described antibodies or fragments) and detecting binding of the antibody or fragment to protein in the sample, thereby detecting the presence of MMP9. In some cases, a sample is first obtained or provided. In some examples, the methods include comparing the amount or level of MMP9 detected to a control level or amount, such as by comparing the amount of binding detected in the test sample with an amount of binding of the antibody or fragment to a control sample. In some cases, the methods involve simply comparing a test level and a control level of MMP9.

The methods generally are carried out by administering to the subject an MMP9 binding protein, such as an MMP9-binding antibody or fragment thereof as provided herein, e.g., in an effective amount. The antibody or fragment generally specifically, hinds to and non-competitively inhibits MMP9, for example, such that MMP9 activity is inhibited in the subject. In some cases, the antibody or fragment is one that binds MMP9 outside of the cysteine-switch active pocket, such as in one of the epitopes described above.

See, for example, Hu et al. (2007) <i>Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery </i>6:480-498. Thus, it is desirable to inhibit the activity of one or more particular MMPs in certain therapeutic settings. While sharing significant homology at a sequence level, the expression and functional roles of the two gelatinases MMP9 and MMP2 vary significantly. MMP9 expression is induced by a number of disease associated cytokines and growth factors. Also, the MMP9 knockout mouse is protected in a variety of disease models, whereas MMP2 is more constitutively expressed and the MMP2 knockout animals tend toward little protection. Some studies have shown that MMP2 knockout mouse exhibited worse disease in challenge models. For some diseases or disorders, the activity of more than one MMPs is inhibited. In clinical studies, the inhibitors to more than one MMPs have caused adverse effects, such as toxicity or lack of efficacy, that are not desired. It has been shown that the activity of certain MMPs, e.g., MMP2, is often required for normal tissue homeostasis and/or is protective against disease. Certain available MMP inhibitors have caused side effects.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">Among the provided embodiments are agents, including therapeutic reagents, such as antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, that specifically inhibit the catalytic activity of a single MMP or a select plurality of MMPs, such as MMP9 and that do not react with or inhibit certain other MMPs or any other MMPs. Also among the provided embodiments are methods and uses of the same for treatment of various diseases.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">MMP9 Binding Proteins</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">The present disclosure provides binding proteins, e.g., antibodies and fragments (e.g., antigen-binding fragments) thereof, that hind to the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) protein (MMP9 is also known as gelatinase-B), e.g., human MMP9, such as the human MMP9 having an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 27 or SEQ ID NO: 28. The binding proteins of the present disclosure generally comprise an immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain (or functional fragment thereof) and an Ig light chain (or functional fragment thereof).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">The disclosure further provides MMP9 binding proteins that hind specifically MMP9 and not to other matrix metalloproteinases such as MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, MMP9, MMP10, MMP12, and MMP13. Such specific MMP9 binding proteins are thus generally not significantly or delectably crossreactive with non-MMP9 matrix metalloproteinases. MMP9 binding proteins that specifically bind MMP9 find use in applications in which it is necessary or desirable to obtain specific modulation (e.g., inhibition) of MMP9, e.g., without directly affecting the activity of other matrix metalloproteinases.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">In certain embodiments of the present disclosure, an anti-MMP9 antibody is an inhibitor of the activity of MMP9, and can be a specific inhibitor of MMP9. In one embodiment, the MMP9 binding proteins disclosed herein is useful for inhibition of MMP9 while not affecting other matrix metalloproteinases. &#x201c;An inhibitor of MMP&#x201d; or &#x201c;inhibitor of MMP9 activity&#x201d; can be an antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof that directly or indirectly inhibits activity of MMP9, including but not limited to enzymatic processing, inhibiting action of MMP9 on it substrate (e.g., by inhibiting substrate binding, substrate cleavage, and the like), and the like.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">The present disclosure also provides MMP9 binding proteins that specifically hind to non-mouse MMP9, such as human MMP9, Cynomolgus monkey MMP9, and rat MMP9.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">The present disclosure also provides MMP9 binding proteins (e.g., anti-MMP9 antibodies and functional fragments thereof) that act as non-competitive inhibitors. A &#x201c;non-competitive inhibitor&#x201d; refers to an inhibitor binds at site away from substrate binding site of an enzyme, and thus can bind the enzyme and effect inhibitory activity regardless of whether or not the enzyme is bound to its substrate. The non-competitive or allosteric inhibition is generally independent of substrate association or concentration. Such non-competitive inhibitors can, for example, provide for a level of inhibition that can be substantially independent of substrate concentration.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">MMP9 binding proteins (e.g., antibodies and functional fragments thereof) of the present disclosure include those that bind MMP9, particularly human MMP9, and having a heavy chain polypeptide (or functional fragment thereof) that has at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or more amino acid sequence identity to a heavy chain polypeptide disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">MMP9 binding proteins (e.g., antibodies and functional fragments thereof) of the present disclosure include those that bind MMP9, particularly human MMP9, and having a light polypeptide (or functional fragment thereof) that has at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or more amino acid sequence identity to a heavy chain polypeptide disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">MMP9 binding proteins (e.g., antibodies and functional fragments thereof) of the present disclosure include those that bind MMP9, particularly human MMP9, and have a heavy chain polypeptide (or functional fragment thereof) having the complementarity determining regions (&#x201c;CDRs&#x201d;) of heavy chain polypeptide and the CDRs of a light chain polypeptide (or functional fragment thereof) as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">&#x201c;Homology&#x201d; or &#x201c;identity&#x201d; or &#x201c;similarity&#x201d; as used herein in the context of nucleic acids and polypeptides refers to the relationship between two polypeptides or two nucleic acid molecules based on an alignment of the amino acid sequences or nucleic acid sequences, respectively. Homology and identity can each be determined by comparing a position in each sequence which may be aligned for purposes of comparison. When an equivalent position in the compared sequences is occupied by the same base or amino acid, then the molecules are identical at that position; when the equivalent site occupied by the same or a similar amino acid residue (e.g., similar in steric and/or electronic nature), then the molecules can be referred to as homologous (similar) at that position. Expression as a percentage of homology/similarity or identity refers to a function of the number of identical or similar amino acids at positions shared by the compared sequences. In comparing two sequences, the absence of residues (amino acids or nucleic acids) or presence of extra residues also decreases the identity and homology/similarity.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">As used herein, &#x201c;identity&#x201d; means the percentage of identical nucleotide or amino acid residues at corresponding positions in two or more sequences when the sequences are aligned to maximize sequence matching, i.e., taking into account gaps and insertions. Sequences are generally aligned for maximum correspondence over a designated region, e.g., a region at least about 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 or more amino acids or nucleotides in length, and can be up to the full-length of the reference amino acid or nucleotide. For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are input into a computer program, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s) relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">Examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-410 and Altschul et al, (1977) Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Further exemplary algorithms include ClustalW (Higgins D., et al. (1994) Nucleic Acids Res 22: 4673-4680), available at www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw/index.html.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Residue positions which are not identical can differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing, side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side chains is cysteine and methionine.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">Sequence identity between two nucleic acids can also be described in terms of hybridization of two molecules to each other under stringent conditions. The hybridization conditions are selected following standard methods in the art (see, for example, Sambrook, et Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, (1989) Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.). An example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization at 50&#xb0; C. or higher and 0.1&#xd7;SSC (15 mM sodium chloride/1.5 mM sodium citrate). Another example of stringent hybridization conditions is overnight libation at 42&#xb0; C. in a solution: 50% formamide, 5&#xd7;SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH7.6), 5&#xd7;Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 mg/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 0.1&#xd7;SSC at about 65&#xb0; C. Stringent hybridization conditions are hybridization conditions that are at least as stringent as the above representative conditions, where conditions are considered to be at least as stringent if they are at least about 80% as stringent, typically at least 90% as stringent as the above specific stringent conditions.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">Accordingly, the present disclosure provides, for example, antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof, comprising a heavy chain variable region polypeptide having at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or greater amino acid sequence identity to an amino acid sequence of a heavy chain variable region described herein (e.g., SEQ ID NOS:1 or 5-8), and a variable light chain polypeptide having at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or greater amino acid sequence identity to an amino acid sequence of a light chain polypeptide as set forth herein (e.g., SEQ ID NOS:2 or 9-12).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">Examples of anti-MMP9 antibodies of the present disclosure are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Antibodies</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">The MMP9 binding proteins include antibodies and functional fragments thereof, such as those that specifically bind to MMP9. As used herein, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; means an isolated or recombinant polypeptide binding agent that comprises peptide sequences (e.g., variable region sequences) that specifically bind an antigenic epitope. The term is used in its broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies (including full-length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, human antibodies, humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, nanobodies, diabodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments including but not limited to Fv, scFv, Fab, Fab&#x2032; F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>and Fab<sub>2</sub>, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. The term &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d; refers to antibodies containing sequences of human origin, except for possible non-human CDR regions, and does not imply that the full structure of an immunoglobulin molecule be present, only that the antibody has minimal immunogenic effect in a human (i.e., does not induce the production of antibodies to itself).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">An &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; comprises a portion of a full-length antibody, for example, the antigen binding or variable region a full-length antibody. Such antibody fragments may also be referred to herein as &#x201c;functional fragments: or &#x201c;antigen-binding fragments&#x201d;. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (Zapata et al. (1995) <i>Protein Eng. </i>8(10): 1057-1062); single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called &#x201c;Fab&#x201d; fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual &#x201c;Fc&#x201d; fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">&#x201c;Fv&#x201d; is a minimum antibody fragment containing a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. It is in this configuration that the three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the V<sub>H</sub>-V<sub>L </sub>dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or an isolated V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L </sub>region comprising only three of the six CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although generally at a lower affinity than does the entire F<sub>v </sub>fragment.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">The &#x201c;F<sub>ab</sub>&#x201d; fragment also contains, in addition to heavy and light chain variable regions, the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH<sub>1</sub>) of the heavy chain. Fab fragments were originally observed following papain digestion of an antibody. Fab&#x2032; fragments differ from Fab fragments in that F(ab&#x2032;) fragments contain several additional residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH<sub>1 </sub>domain, including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments contain two Fab fragments joined, near the hinge region, by disulfide bonds, and were originally observed following pepsin digestion of an antibody. Fab&#x2032;-SH is the designation herein for Fab&#x2032; fragments in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">The &#x201c;light chains&#x201d; of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to five major classes: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, 401, and IgA2.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">&#x201c;Single-chain Fv&#x201d; or &#x201c;sFv&#x201d; or &#x201c;scFv&#x201d; antibody fragments comprise the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. In some embodiments, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains, which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv, see Pluckthun, in <i>The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies</i>, vol. 113 (Rosenburg and Moore eds.) Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">The term &#x201c;diabodies&#x201d; refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (V<sub>H</sub>) connected to a light-chain variable domain (V<sub>L</sub>) in the same polypeptide chain (V<sub>H</sub>-V<sub>L</sub>). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain, thereby creating two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are additionally described, for example, in EP 404,097; WO 93/11161 and Hollinger et al. (1993) <i>Proc. Natl, Acad. Sci. USA </i>90:6444-6448.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">An &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; antibody is one that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a corrrponent of its natural environment. Components of its natural environment may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In some embodiments, an isolated antibody is purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, for example, more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence, e.g., by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by gel electrophoresis (e.g., SDS-PAGE) under reducing or nonreducing conditions, with detection by Coomassie blue or silver stain. The term &#x201c;isolated antibody&#x201d; includes an antibody in situ within recombinant cells, since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. In certain embodiments, isolated antibody is prepared by at least one purification step.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">As used herein, &#x201c;immunoreactive&#x201d; refers to antibodies or fragments thereof that are specific to a sequence of amino acid residues (&#x201c;binding site&#x201d; or &#x201c;epitope&#x201d;), yet if are crossreactive to other peptides/proteins, are not toxic at the levels at which they are formulated for administration to human use. &#x201c;Epitope&#x201d; refers to that portion of an antigen capable of forming a binding interaction with an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof. An epitope can be a linear peptide sequence (i.e., &#x201c;continuous&#x201d;) or can be composed of noncontiguous amino acid sequences &#x201c;conformational&#x201d; or &#x201c;discontinuous&#x201d;). The term &#x201c;preferentially binds&#x201d; means that the binding agent binds to the binding site with greater affinity than it binds unrelated amino acid sequences.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">Anti-MMP9 antibodies can be described in terms of the CDRs of the heavy and light chains. As used herein, the term &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; or &#x201c;complementarity determining region&#x201d; is intended to mean the non-contiguous antigen combining sites found within the variable region of both heavy and light chain polypeptides. These particular regions have been described by Kabat et al., J. Biol.

These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as &#x201c;import&#x201d; or &#x201c;donor&#x201d; residues, which are typically obtained from an &#x201c;import&#x201d; or &#x201c;donor&#x201d; variable domain. For example, humanization can be performed essentially according to the method of Winter and co-workers, by substituting rodent. CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. See, for example, Jones et al., supra; Riechmann et al., supra and Verhoeyen et al. (1988) <i>Science </i>239:1534-1536. Accordingly, such &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibodies include chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In certain embodiments, humanized antibodies are human antibodies in which some CDR residues and optionally some framework region residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies (e.g., murine monoclonal antibodies).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">Human antibodies can also be produced, for example, by using phage display libraries. Hoogenboom et al. (1991) <i>J. Mol. Biol, </i>227:381; Marks et al. (1991) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>222:581. Other methods for preparing human monoclonal antibodies are described by Cole et al, (1985) &#x201c;Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Ttherapy,&#x201d; Alan R. Liss, p. 77 and Boerner et al, (1991) <i>J. Immunol. </i>147:86-95.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">Human antibodies can be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals (e.g., mice) in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon immunological challenge, human antibody production is observed, which closely resembles that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and antibody repertoire. This approach is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016, and in the following scientific publications: Marks et al, (1992) <i>Bio/Technology </i>10:779-783 (1992); Lonberg et al.

In some embodiments, affinity matured antibodies have an affinity which is five times or more, ten times or more, twenty times or more, or thirty times or more than that of the starting antibody (generally murine, rabbit, chicken, humanized or human) from which the matured antibody is prepared.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">An antibody can also be a bispecific antibody. Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal, and may be human or humanized antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present case, the two different binding specificities can be directed to two different MMPs, or to two different epitopes on a single MMP (e.g., MMP9).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">An antibody as disclosed herein can also be an immunoconjugate. Such immunoconjugates comprise an antibody (e.g., to MMP9) conjugated to a second molecule, such as a reporter An immunoconjugate can also comprise an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope a radioconjugate).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">An antibody that &#x201c;specifically binds to&#x201d; or is &#x201c;specific for&#x201d; a particular polypeptide or an epitope refers to the selective binding of the antibody to the target antigen or epitope; these terms, and methods for determining specific binding, are well understood in the art. An antibody exhibits &#x201c;specific binding&#x201d; for a particular target antigen or epitope if it binds with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration to that target antigen or epitope than it does with other substances. In some embodiments, the antibody that specifically binds to the polypeptide or epitope is one that that binds to that particular polypeptide or epitope without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">In some embodiments, the provided antibodies specifically bind to human MMP9 with a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) equal to or lower than 100 nM, optionally lower than 10 nM, optionally lower than 1 nM, optionally lower than 0.5 nM, optionally lower than 0.1 nM, optionally lower than 0.01 nM, or optionally lower than 0.005 nM, in certain examples, between 0.1 and 0.2 nM, or between 0.1 and 10 pM, e.g., between 0.4 and 9 pm, such as between 0.4 and 8.8 pm, in the form of monoclonal antibody, scFv, Fab, or other form of antibody measured at a temperature of about 4&#xb0; C., 25&#xb0; C., 37&#xb0; C. or 42&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0074">In certain embodiments, an antibody of the present disclosure binds to one or more processing sites (e.g., sites of proteolytic cleavage) in MMP9, thereby effectively blocking processing of the proenzyme or preproenzyme to the catalytically active enzyme, and thus reducing the proteolytic activity of the MMP9.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0075">In certain embodiments, an antibody according to the present disclosure binds to MMP9 with an affinity at least 2 times, at least 5 times, at least 10 times, at least 25 times, at least 50 times, at least 100 times, at least 500 times, or at least 1000 times greater than its binding affinity for another MMP.

Also provided are antibodies and fragments that specifically bind to an epitope of MMP9, where the epitope includes an amino acid residue within a particular region of MMP9 or multiple regions of MMP9. Such regions can include, for example, structural loops and/or other structural domains of MMP9, such as those shown to be important for binding to exemplary antibodies described herein. Typically, the regions are defined according to amino acid residue positions on the full-length MMP9 sequence, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 27. In some examples, the epitope is outside of cysteine-switch active pocket of SEQ ID NO: 27. In some example, the epitope contains an amino acid residue (i.e., one or more amino acid residue(s)) within a region that is residues 104-202 of SEQ ID NO: 27. In one example, the epitope contains an amino acid residue (i.e., one or more amino acid residue(s)) within a region that is residues 104-119, residues 159-166, or residues 191-202 of SEQ ID NO: 27. In some aspects, the epitope includes an amino acid residue (i.e., one or more amino acid residue(s)) within a region of MMP9 that is residues 104-119 of SEQ ID NO: 27, an amino acid residue within a region of MMP9 that is residues 159-166 of SEQ ID NO: 27, and an amino acid residue within a region of MMP9 that is residues 191-202 of SEQ ID NO: 27.

Such pharmaceutical compositions are useful for, for example, administration to a subject in vivo or ex vivo, and for diagnosing and/or treating a subject with the MMP9 binding proteins, such as in any of the therapeutic or diagnostic methods provided herein.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0125">Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are physiologically acceptable to the administered patient and retain the therapeutic properties of the antibodies or peptides with which it is administered. Pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers and their formulations are and generally described in, for example, Remington' pharmaceutical Sciences (18th Edition, ed. A. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. 1990). One exemplary pharmaceutical carrier is physiological saline. Each carrier is &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not substantially injurious to the patient.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0126">Pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated to be compatible with a particular route of administration, systemic or local. Thus, pharmaceutical compositions include carriers, diluents, or excipients suitable for administration by various routes.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0127">Pharmaceutical compositions can include pharmaceutically acceptable additives. Examples of additives include, but are not limited to, a sugar such as mannitol, sorbitol, glucose, xylitol, trehalose, sorbose, sucrose, galactose, dextran, dextrose, fructose, lactose and mixtures thereof. Pharmaceutically acceptable additives can be combined with pharmaceutically, acceptable carriers and/or excipients such as dextrose. Additives also include surfactants such as polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0128">The formulation and delivery methods will generally be adapted according to the site and the disease to be treated. Exemplary formulations include, but are not limited to, those suitable for parenteral administration, e.g., intravenous, intra-arterial, intramuscular, or subcutaneous administration, or oral administration.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0129">Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral delivery include, for example, water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, dextrose/saline, and glucose solutions. The formulations can contain auxiliary substances to approximate physiological conditions, such as buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, wetting agents, detergents and the like. Additives can also include additional active ingredients such as bactericidal agents, or stabilizers. For example, the solution can contain sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sorbitan monolaurate or triethanolamine oleate. Additional parenteral formulations and methods are described in Bai (1997) J. Neuroimmunol. 80:65 75; Warren (1997) J. Neurol. Sci. 152:31 38; and Tonegawa (1997) J. Exp. Med. 186:507 515. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0130">Pharmaceutical compositions for intradermal or subcutaneous administration can include a sterile diluent, such as water, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, glutathione or sodium hisulfite, chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0131">Pharmaceutical compositions for injection include aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor ELTM (BASE, Parsippany. N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. Fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Antibacterial and antifungal agents include, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid and thimerosal. Isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as marital, sorbitol, and sodium chloride may be included in the composition. The resulting solutions can be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized; the lyophilized preparation can later be combined with a sterile solution prior to administration.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0132">Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can contain a compound that stabilizes, increases, or delays absorption or clearance. Such compounds include, for example, carbohydrates, such as glucose, sucrose, or dextrans; low molecular weight proteins; compositions that reduce the clearance or hydrolysis of peptides; or excipients or other stabilizers and/or buffers. Agents that delay absorption include, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Detergents can also be used to stabilize or to increase or decrease the absorption of the pharmaceutical composition, including liposomal carriers. To protect from digestion the compound can be complexed with a composition to render it resistant to acidic and enzymatic hydrolysis, or the compound can be complexed in an appropriately resistant carrier such as a liposome. Means of protecting compounds from digestion are known in the art (see, e.g., Fix (1996) Pharm Res. 13:1760 1764; Samanen (1996) J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 48:119 135; and U.S. Pat.

Thus, provided are diagnostic and therapeutic methods and uses of the anti-MMP9 antibodies. Examples of methods of use are described below.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0139">Methods of Treatment</p><p id="p-0155" num="0140">Provided herein are methods of treatment, including methods of treating diseases and disorders associated with MMP9 expression and/or activity, as well as uses of the provided antibodies and compositions in such methods. The diseases and disorders include, but are not limited to cancer, e.g., tumors (e.g., primary or metastatic tumors), such as those that express or are disposed in a tissue which expresses MMP9, and inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory myopathies.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0141">As used herein, &#x201c;treat&#x201d; or &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; means stasis or a postponement of development of one or more symptoms associated with a disease or disorder described herein, or ameliorating existing uncontrolled or unwanted symptoms, preventing additional symptoms, or ameliorating or preventing the underlying metabolic causes of symptoms. Thus, the terms denote that a beneficial result has been conferred on a mammalian subject with a disease or symptom, or with the potential to develop such disease or symptom. A response is achieved when the patient experiences partial or total alleviation, or reduction of signs or symptoms of illness, and can include, without limitation, prolongation of survival. The expected progression-free survival times can be measured in months to years, depending on prognostic factors including the number of relapses, stage of disease, and other factors.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0142">Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions for use in connection with such methods, such as those containing any of the antibodies or fragments thereof described herein. Compositions can be suitable for administration locally or systemically by any suitable route.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0143">In general, MMP9 binding proteins are administered in a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., in an amount to effect inhibition of tumor growth in a subject, to inhibit metastasis, to inhibit inflammation, to inhibit tissue destruction, to inhibit. MMP9 activity, or to treat the particular disease or condition associated with MMP9.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0144">As used herein, unless otherwise specified, the term &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; or &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount of an agent or compound or composition that when administered (either alone or in combination with another therapeutic agent, as may be specified) to a subject is effective to prevent or ameliorate the disease condition or the progression of the disease, or result in amelioration of symptoms, e.g., treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of the relevant medical condition, or an increase in rate of treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of such conditions. When applied to an individual active ingredient administered alone, a therapeutically effective dose refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, a therapeutically effective dose refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously. In one example, when in vivo administration of art anti-MMP9 antibody is employed, normal dosage amounts can vary from about 10 ng/kg to up to 100 mg/kg of mammal body weight or more per day, preferably about 1 &#x3bc;g/kg/day to 50 mg/kg/day, optionally about 100 &#x3bc;g/kg/day to 20 mg/kg/day, 500 &#x3bc;g/kg/day to 10 mg/kg/day, or 1 mg/kg/day to 10 mg/kg/day, depending upon the route of administration. In one embodiment, intravenous dosage range from about 1 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg. In some embodiments, intravenous dosages range from at or about 1 mg/kg to at or about 14 mg/kg, such as from at or about 2 mg/kg to at or about 14 mg/kg, q114d, once every 14 days. In other embodiments, subcutaneous dosages range from at or about 1 mg/kg to at or about 28 mg/kg, such as from at or about 2 mg/kg to at or about 28 mg/kg, q14 d, once every 14 days. In some embodiments, the effective amount of dosage is administered once every 7 to 28 days. In one embodiment, the effective amount of dosage is administered once every 7 days. In another embodiment, the effective amount of dosage is administered once every 28 days.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0145">The selected dosage regimen will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the MMP9 binding protein, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular composition employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0146">A clinician having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician or veterinarian can start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0147">In some cases, the methods of treatment include parenteral administration, e.g., intravenous, intra-arterial, intramuscular, or subcutaneous administration, or oral administration of the agent, e.g., anti-MMP9 antibody or composition containing the same.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0148">As used herein, the term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; means a mammalian subject. Exemplary subjects include, but are not limited to humans, monkeys, dogs, cats, mice, rats, cows, horses, goats and sheep. In some embodiments, the subject has cancer, an inflammatory disease or condition, or an autoimmune disease or condition, and can be treated with the agent of the present invention as described below.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0149">If needed, for treatments, methods can further include additional therapies, such as in the case of cancer, surgical removal of the cancer anal/or administration of an anti-cancer agent or treatment in addition to an MMP9 binding protein. Administration of such an anti-cancer agent or treatment can be concurrent with administration of the compositions disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0150">Methods of Detection of MMP9</p><p id="p-0166" num="0151">The present disclosure also contemplates methods of detecting MMP9 in a subject, e.g., to detect tumor or tumor-associated tissue expressing MMP9, or tissue or fluid or other biological sample associated with a disease as described herein, such as autoimmune or inflammatory disease. Thus, methods of diagnosing, monitoring staging or detecting a tumor having MMP9 activity are provided.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0152">Samples (e.g., test biological samples) from a subject (e.g., an individual suspected of having or known to have a tumor associated with MMP9 expression, or suspected of having or known to have another disease or condition), can be analyzed for MMP9 presence, absence, expression, and/or levels. For example, such samples can be collected and analyzed by detecting the presence or absence of binding of an MMP9 binding protein, such as an antibody or fragment as described herein, to substance (e.g., protein) in the sample. In some examples, the methods further include comparing the amount of binding detected to an amount of binding to a control sample, or comparing the detected level of MMP9 to a control level of MMP9. In some cases, the methods indicate the presence, absence, or severity of an MMP9-associated disease or condition, such as one described herein.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0153">This analysis can be performed prior to the initiation of treatment using an MMP9 binding protein as described herein, or can be done as part of monitoring of progress of cancer treatment. In some embodiments, provided are methods of treatment, carried out by performing the detection assays and initiating, altering, or discontinuing treatment of the subject, for example, based on the results of the diagnostic assay. Such diagnostic analysis can be performed using any sample, including but not limited to tissue, cells isolated from such tissues, and the like. In some cases, the methods are performed on liquid samples, such as blood, plasma, serum, whole blood, saliva, urine, or semen. Tissue samples include, for example, formalin-fixed or frozen tissue sections.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0154">Any suitable method for detection and analysis of MMP9 can be employed. Various diagnostic assay techniques known in the art can be adapted for such purpose, such as competitive binding assays, direct or indirect sandwich assays and immunoprecipitation assays conducted in either heterogeneous or homogeneous phases.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0155">MMP9 binding proteins for use in detection methods can be labeled with a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety directly or indirectly produces a detectable signal. For example, the detectable moiety can be any of those described herein such as, for example, a radioisotope, such as 3H, 14C, 32P, 35S, or 125I, a fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), Texas red, cyanin, photocyan, rhodamine, or luciferin, or an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, &#x3b2;-galactosidase or horseradish peroxidase.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0156">Detection can be accomplished by contacting a sample under conditions suitable for MMP9 binding protein binding to MMP9, and assessing the presence (e.g., level) or absence of MMP9 binding protein-MMP9 complexes. A level of MMP9 in the sample in comparison with a level of a reference sample can indicate the presence of a tumor or tumor-associated tissues having MMP9 activity. The reference sample can be a sample taken from the subject at an earlier time point or a sample from another individual.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0157">Various aspects of the invention are further described and illustrated by way of the several examples which follow, none of which are intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 1A: Preparation of Antibodies to Human MMP-9</heading><p id="p-0173" num="0158">The full-length human MMP9 protein without a signal peptide (SEQ ID NO. 28) was used to immunize mice. Spleen cells from immunized mice were fused with myeloma cells to generate a hybridoma library. Monoclonal cultures were prepared and screened to identify cultures expressing an anti-MMP9 monoclonal antibody.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0159">An antibody (AB0041) was purified from one of the cultures and characterized. This antibody contained an IgG2b heavy chain and a kappa light chain. Characterization included testing for the binding of AB0041 to other human MMPs and to MMP9 proteins from other species, including cynomolgus monkey, rat and mouse. As shown in Table 2, the AB0041 antibody had greater affinity to human and cynomolgus MMP9, that it had lower affinity to rat. MMP9. In addition, the AB0041 antibody did not bind to murine MMP9 or to many human non-MMP matrix metalloproteinases.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00015" num="00015"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Cross reactivity of AB0041 and AB0045</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="140pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Dissociation constant (Kd)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>MMP Tested</entry><entry>AB0045</entry><entry>AB0041</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Human MMP1</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry></row><row><entry>Human MMP2</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry></row><row><entry>Mouse MMP2</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry></row><row><entry>Human MMP3</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry></row><row><entry>Human MMP7</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry></row><row><entry>Human MMP8</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry></row><row><entry>Human MMP9</entry><entry>0.168 &#xb1; 0.117</entry><entry>nM</entry><entry>0.133 &#xb1; 0.030</entry><entry>nM</entry></row><row><entry>Cynomolgus monkey</entry><entry>0.082 &#xb1; 0.022</entry><entry>nM</entry><entry>0.145 &#xb1; 0.16</entry><entry>nM</entry></row><row><entry>MMP9</entry></row><row><entry>Mouse MMP9</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry></row><row><entry>Rat MMP9</entry><entry>0.311 &#xb1; 0.017</entry><entry>nM</entry><entry>0.332 &#xb1; 0.022</entry><entry>nM</entry></row><row><entry>Human MMP10</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry></row><row><entry>Human MMP12</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry></row><row><entry>Human MMP13</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry><entry>&#x3e;100</entry><entry>nM</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0176" num="0160">Additional characterization included assaying the binding of AB0.041 to mutant mouse and human MMP9 proteins. Non-identical residues in the catalytic domain of mouse and human MMP9 proteins were identified, and forty-six non-identical amino acid residues were selected for mutagenesis. Most mutations were generated in mouse MMP9: the mouse amino acid residues were mutated to match those of human MMP9. Other mutations were generated in human MMP9: the human amino acid residues were mutated to match those of mouse MMP9. The mutated mouse or human MMP9 proteins were used in an ELISA assay.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0161">In the ELISA assay, the AB0041 antibody was used as the primary antibody and a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used to detect the binding. The wild-type human MMP9 was used a positive control and the wild-type mouse MMP9 was used as a negative control. The results of the ELISA assay showed an arginine residue at position 162 of the MMP9 amino acid sequence (R162) as important for the MP9 binding of the AB0041 antibody. The results also showed the amino acid residues E111, D113, and I198 were important for the MMP9 binding of the AB0041 antibody. Based on the crystal structure of MMP9, E111, D113, R162, and I198 are grouped near each other around a Ca2+ ion binding pocket of MMP9.

Thus, both antibodies inhibit MMP9 enzymatic activity independently of substrate concentration. The AB0045 antibody binds to the same MMP9 epitope as the AB0041 antibody with an affinity in the 1&#xd7;10-12 molar range, as shown by direct binding and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Both antibodies are specific for MMP9, with no significant non-specific binding observed against other purified protein targets including purified domains and full length forms of MMP enzymes. Both AB0045 and AB0041 antibodies are crossreactive with native and recombinant human and recombinant rat and cynomolgus monkey MMP9.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0184">The in vitro binding affinity, inhibition characteristics, and the specificity of the antibodies of AB0045, AB0041 and AB0046 for MMP9 of human and non-human origin were determined using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and an MMP9 enzymatic assay. SPR analysis was also used to generate dissociation constants (K<sub>d</sub>) of AB0045 and AB0041.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0185">In the ELISA assay, the K<sub>d </sub>value of AB0045 and AB004 antibodies for human, cynomolgus monkey, and rat MMP9 derived from ELISA were all found to be &#x3c;400 pM. The ELISA data illustrated that both AB0045 and AB0041 antibodies cross-react with MMP9 from all the relevant toxicology species tested. The AB0046 antibody was shown to be specific to mouse MMP9 and therefore could be used as a surrogate antibody in mouse efficacy models. The results showed that the K<sub>d </sub>value of the AB0045 antibodies for human MMP9 was 0.168&#xb1;0.117 nM and the and K<sub>d </sub>value of the AB0041 antibody was 0.133&#xb1;0.030 nM. The results on the AB0046 antibodies showed it bound to mouse MMP9 with the IQ value of 0.218&#xb1;0.097 nM. In the SPR analysis, the results showed that the K<sub>d </sub>values of AB0045 and AB0041 antibodies for human MMP9 were 8.8 pM and 0.4 pM, respectively.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0186">The enzymatic inhibitory activities of AB0045, AB0041, and AB0046 antibodies were evaluated in an assay assessing MMP9-mediated cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide substrate Mca-PLOL-Dpa-AR-NH2. All three antibodies inhibited MMP9 enzyme activity. The IC<sub>50 </sub>values of AB0045 (0.691&#xb1;0.097 nM) and AB0041. (0.569&#xb1;0.185 nM) for human MMP9 were not statistically different. The IC<sub>50 </sub>value for the AB0046 inhibition of mouse MMP9 was 0.352&#xb1;0.03 nM. The value was not adjusted for the concentration of active enzyme that was generated during the preparation. Additional MMP9 enzymatic assay under steady-state conditions was used to determine IC<sub>50 </sub>and mode of inhibition. In this assay, the IC<sub>50 </sub>values of AB0045 ranged from 0.148 nM to 0.161 nM in a 20-fold range of substrate concentration, and in one example is 0.158 nm The results showed that the MMP9 inhibitory activity of AB0045 was non-competitive.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00029" num="00029"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="280pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2B</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Binding and Inhibitory Properties of AB0045, AB0041, and surrogate mouse antibody AB0046</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>AB0045</entry><entry>AB0041</entry><entry>AB0046</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="280pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>ELISA</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="49pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Human MMP9</entry><entry>0.168 &#xb1;
