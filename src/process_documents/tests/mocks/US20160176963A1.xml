TIGIT was discovered in genomic searches for proteins specifically expressed on T cells, and has an immunoglobulin variable domain, a transmembrane domain, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), and contains signature sequence elements of the PVR protein family. It is known to interact with poliovirus receptor (PVR; CD155) and with nectin2 (CD112). See e.g. Stengel et al. (2012) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. (USA) 19:5399; WO 2006/124667; WO 2009/126688. Although PVR may interact with the co-activating receptor DNAM-1 (CD226) to enhance tumor killing, the high affinity TIGIT/PVR interaction would inhibit such killing, and may act to prevent killing of normal (self) cells that also express PVR. Stanietsky et al. (2009) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. (USA) 106:17858. The dominance of this inhibitory interaction may be important in suppression of anti-self immune reactions, but in the tumor context it suppresses tumor eradication. Id.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">TIGIT suppresses T cell activation by promoting the generation of mature immunoregulatory dendritic cells. Yu et al. (2009) <i>Nat. Immunol. </i>10:48. TIGIT and other such co-inhibitory molecules (e.g. CTLA-4, PD-1, Lag3 and BTLA) may play a role in evasion of immunosurveillance by tumor cells. Experiments have shown that PVR/CD155 is over-expressed on melanoma cells (Inozume et al. (2014) <i>J. Invest. Dermatol. </i>134:S121&#x2014;Abstract 693) and various other tumors. It is possible that the TIGIT/PVR interaction can shield such tumor cells from immune-mediated eradication by inhibiting anti-tumor responses of T and NK cells. Stanietsky et al. (2009) <i>Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci</i>. (<i>USA</i>) 106:17858 and Lozano et al. (2012) <i>J. Immunol. </i>188:3869. Other experiments have identified a TIGIT subset of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) that selectively suppress Th1 and Th17 responses (Joller et al. (2014) <i>Immunity </i>40:569), suggesting an alternative mechanism by which an anti-TIGIT antibody may enhance anti-tumor immune response.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">TIGIT may act to &#x201c;turn off&#x201d; the immune response similarly to other co-inhibitory receptors such as CTLA-4, PD-1 and BTLA. Id. Antibodies targeting CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) and PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) have been approved for the treatment of human cancers, validating this therapeutic approach. Antibodies that bind to human TIGIT might also find use in treatment of cancers. See e.g. WO 2006/124667. In mouse models, antibody blockade of both PD-L1 and TIGIT leads to a synergistic enhancement of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell mediated tumor rejection. Grogan et al. (2014) <i>J. Immunol. </i>192(1) Suppl. 203.15; Johnston et al. (2014) <i>Cancer Cell </i>26:1-15. Similar results have been obtained in animal models of melanoma. Inozume et al. (2014) <i>J. Invest. Dermatol. </i>134:S121&#x2014;Abstract 693. Some experiments suggest that TIGIT blockade is effective to enhance anti-tumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response only in the presence of the co-activating receptor DNAM-1/CD226, which competes with TIGIT for binding to PVR/CD155. Johnston et al. (2014) <i>Cancer Cell </i>26:1-15.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recent experiments have demonstrated that intratumoral bacteria expressing Fap2 protein may inhibit NK cell mediated tumor killing by binding to TIGIT (Gur et al. (2015) <i>Immunity </i>42:344), suggesting that eliminating such bacteria, blocking the interaction of TIGIT with Fap2, or blocking the activity of TIGIT generally, may be useful in treatment of cancer, e.g. colorectal cancer. Hampton (2015) <i>AMA </i>313:1305.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The need exists for improved methods of treating cancer and chronic viral infections and medicaments, such as therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, for use in the methods.

Residue numbers are 21 lower than the numbering for SEQ ID NO: 1 because the sequence listing includes the signal peptide, which is not included in the figures. As detailed in Example 4, yeast displaying sequence variants of huTIGIT were selected based on their inability to bind to the respective antibodies (22G2, 11G11, 15A6).

Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as V<sub>H</sub>) and a heavy chain constant region. In certain naturally occurring IgG, IgD and IgA antibodies, the heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. In certain naturally occurring antibodies, each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as V<sub>L</sub>) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>is composed of three CDRs and four framework regions (FRs), arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (C1q) of the classical complement system.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Antibodies typically bind specifically to their cognate antigen with high affinity, reflected by a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;11</sup>M or less. Any K<sub>D </sub>greater than about 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>M is generally considered to indicate nonspecific binding. As used herein, an antibody that &#x201c;binds specifically&#x201d; to an antigen refers to an antibody that binds to the antigen and substantially identical antigens with high affinity, which means having a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M or less, preferably 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>M or less, even more preferably 5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>M or less, and most preferably between 10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M and 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M or less, but does not bind with high affinity to unrelated antigens. An antigen is &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; to a given antigen if it exhibits a high degree of sequence identity to the given antigen, for example, if it exhibits at least 80%, at least 90%, preferably at least 95%, more preferably at least 97%, or even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity to the sequence of the given antigen. By way of example, an antibody that binds specifically to human TIGIT might also cross-react with TIGIT from certain non-human primate species (e.g., cynomolgus monkey), but might not cross-react with TIGIT from other species, or with an antigen other than TIGIT.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Antibodies may exhibit modifications at the N- and/or C-terminal amino acid residues. For example, antibodies of the present invention may be produced from a construct encoding a C-terminal lysine residue, for example on the heavy chain, but such C-terminal lysine may be partially or totally absent in the therapeutic antibody that is sold or administered. Alternatively, an antibody may be produced from constructs that specifically do not encode a C-terminal lysine residue even though such lysine was present in the parental antibody from which the therapeutic antibody was derived. In another example, an N-terminal glutamine or glutamic acid residue in an antibody of the present invention may be partially or fully converted to pyro-glutamic acid in the therapeutic antibody that is sold or administered. Any form of glutamine or glutamic acid present at the N-terminus of an antibody chain, including pyro-glutamic acid, is encompassed within the term &#x201c;glutamine&#x201d; as used herein. Accordingly, antibody chain sequences provided herein having N-terminal glutamine or glutamic acid residue encompass antibody chains regardless of the level of pyro-glutamic acid formation.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Unless otherwise indicated, an immunoglobulin may be from any of the commonly known isotypes, including but not limited to IgA, secretory IgA, IgG and IgM. The IgG isotype is divided in subclasses in certain species: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 in humans, and IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 in mice. Immunoglobulins, e.g., human IgG1, exist in several allotypes, which differ from each other in at most a few amino acids. Unless otherwise indicated, &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; may include, by way of example, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies; chimeric and humanized antibodies; human and non-human antibodies; wholly synthetic antibodies; and single chain antibodies.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The term &#x201c;antigen-binding portion&#x201d; or &#x201c;antigen binding fragment&#x201d; of an antibody, as used herein, refers to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., human TIGIT). Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term &#x201c;antigen-binding portion/fragment&#x201d; of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment&#x2014;a monovalent fragment consisting of the V<sub>L</sub>, V<sub>H</sub>, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment&#x2014;a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the V<sub>H </sub>and CH1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the V<sub>L </sub>and V<sub>H </sub>domains of a single arm of an antibody, and (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) <i>Nature </i>341:544-546) consisting of a V<sub>H </sub>domain. An isolated complementarity determining region (CDR), or a combination of two or more isolated CDRs joined by a synthetic linker, may comprise and antigen binding domain of an antibody if able to bind antigen.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Single chain antibody constructs are also included in the invention. Although the two domains of the Fv fragment, V<sub>L </sub>and V<sub>H</sub>, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the V<sub>L </sub>and V<sub>H </sub>regions pair to form monovalent molecules known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) <i>Science </i>242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term &#x201c;antigen-binding portion/fragment&#x201d; of an antibody. These and other potential constructs are described at Chan &#x26; Carter (2010) <i>Nat. Rev. Immunol. </i>10:301. These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies. Antigen-binding portions/fragments can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact immunoglobulins.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Unless otherwise indicated, the word &#x201c;fragment&#x201d; when used with reference to an antibody, such as in a claim, refers to an antigen binding fragment of the antibody, such that &#x201c;antibody or fragment&#x201d; has the same meaning as &#x201c;antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A &#x201c;bispecific&#x201d; or &#x201c;bifunctional antibody&#x201d; is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs, giving rise to two antigen binding sites with specificity for different antigens. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab&#x2032; fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai &#x26; Lachmann (1990) <i>Clin. Exp. Immunol. </i>79:315; Kostelny et al. (1992) <i>J. Immunol. </i>148:1547.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to an antibody that displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope or a composition of antibodies in which all antibodies display a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope. Typically such monoclonal antibodies will be derived from a single cell or nucleic acid encoding the antibody, and will be propagated without intentionally introducing any sequence alterations. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;human monoclonal antibody&#x201d; refers to a monoclonal antibody that has variable and optional constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In one embodiment, human monoclonal antibodies are produced by a hybridoma, for example, obtained by fusing a B cell obtained from a transgenic or transchromosomal non-human animal (e.g., a transgenic mouse having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a light chain transgene), to an immortalized cell.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The term &#x201c;recombinant human antibody,&#x201d; as used herein, includes all human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as (a) antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic or transchromosomal for human immunoglobulin genes or a hybridoma prepared therefrom, (b) antibodies isolated from a host cell transformed to express the antibody, e.g., from a transfectoma, (c) antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library, and (d) antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involve splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies comprise variable and constant regions that utilize particular human germline immunoglobulin sequences are encoded by the germline genes, but include subsequent rearrangements and mutations that occur, for example, during antibody maturation. As known in the art (see, e.g., Lonberg (2005) <i>Nature Biotech. </i>23(9):1117-1125), the variable region contains the antigen binding domain, which is encoded by various genes that rearrange to form an antibody specific for a foreign antigen. In addition to rearrangement, the variable region can be further modified by multiple single amino acid changes (referred to as somatic mutation or hypermutation) to increase the affinity of the antibody to the foreign antigen. The constant region will change in further response to an antigen (i.e., isotype switch). Therefore, the rearranged and somatically mutated nucleic acid sequences that encode the light chain and heavy chain immunoglobulin polypeptides in response to an antigen may not be identical to the original germline sequences, but instead will be substantially identical or similar (i.e., have at least 80% identity).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A &#x201c;human&#x201d; antibody (HuMAb) refers to an antibody having variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. Furthermore, if the antibody contains a constant region, the constant region also is derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. Human antibodies of the present invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo). However, the term &#x201c;human antibody,&#x201d; as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences. The terms &#x201c;human&#x201d; antibodies and &#x201c;fully human&#x201d; antibodies are used synonymously.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">A &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibody refers to an antibody in which some, most or all of the amino acids outside the CDR domains of a non-human antibody, e.g. a mouse antibody, are replaced with corresponding amino acids derived from human immunoglobulins. In one embodiment of a humanized form of an antibody, some, most or all of the amino acids outside the CDR domains have been replaced with amino acids from human immunoglobulins, whereas some, most or all amino acids within one or more CDR regions are unchanged. Small additions, deletions, insertions, substitutions or modifications of amino acids are permissible as long as they do not abrogate the ability of the antibody to bind to a particular antigen. A &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibody retains an antigenic specificity similar to that of the original antibody.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A &#x201c;chimeric antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody in which the variable regions are derived from one species and the constant regions are derived from another species, such as an antibody in which the variable regions are derived from a mouse antibody and the constant regions are derived from a human antibody. A &#x201c;hybrid&#x201d; antibody refers to an antibody having heavy and light chains of different types, such as a mouse (parental) heavy chain and a humanized light chain, or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As used herein, &#x201c;isotype&#x201d; refers to the antibody class (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgM, IgA1, IgA2, IgD, and IgE antibody) that is encoded by the heavy chain constant region genes.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">&#x201c;Allotype&#x201d; refers to naturally occurring variants within a specific isotype group, which variants differ in one or a few amino acids.

FcRs that bind to an IgG antibody comprise receptors of the Fc&#x3b3;R family, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. The Fc&#x3b3;R family consists of three activating (Fc&#x3b3;RI, Fc&#x3b3;RIII, and Fc&#x3b3;RIV in mice; Fc&#x3b3;RIA, Fc&#x3b3;RIIA, and Fc&#x3b3;RIIIA in humans) and one inhibitory (Fc&#x3b3;RIIb, or equivalently Fc&#x3b3;RIIB) receptor. Various properties of human Fc&#x3b3;Rs are summarized in Table 1. The majority of innate effector cell types co-express one or more activating Fc&#x3b3;R and the inhibitory Fc&#x3b3;RIIb, whereas natural killer (NK) cells selectively express one activating Fc receptor (Fc&#x3b3;RIII in mice and Fc&#x3b3;RIIIA in humans) but not the inhibitory Fc&#x3b3;RIIb in mice and humans.

Thus, an Fc region comprises the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain (e.g., CH1 or CL). In IgG, IgA and IgD antibody isotypes, the Fc region comprises CH2 and CH3 constant domains in each of the antibody's two heavy chains; IgM and IgE Fc regions comprise three heavy chain constant domains (C<sub>H </sub>domains 2-4) in each polypeptide chain. For IgG, the Fc region comprises immunoglobulin domains C&#x3b3;2 and C&#x3b3;3 and the hinge between C&#x3b3;1 and C&#x3b3;2. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position C226 or P230 (or an amino acid between these two amino acids) to the carboxy-terminus of the heavy chain, wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat.

The C<sub>H2 </sub>domain of a human IgG Fc region extends from about amino acid 231 to about amino acid 340, whereas the C<sub>H3 </sub>domain is positioned on C-terminal side of a C<sub>H2 </sub>domain in an Fc region, i.e., it extends from about amino acid 341 to about amino acid 447 of an IgG (including a C-terminal lysine). As used herein, the Fc region may be a native sequence Fc, including any allotypic variant, or a variant Fc (e.g., a non-naturally occurring Fc).

For example, literature references regarding the effects of amino acid substitutions in the Fc region will typically use EU numbering, which allows for reference to any given residue in the Fc region of an antibody by the same number regardless of the length of the variable domain to which is it attached.

Epitopes within protein antigens can be formed both from contiguous amino acids (usually a linear epitope) or noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of the protein (usually a conformational epitope). Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are typically, but not always, retained on exposure to denaturing solvents, whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost on treatment with denaturing solvents. An epitope typically includes at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">The term &#x201c;epitope mapping&#x201d; refers to the process of identification of the molecular determinants on the antigen involved in antibody-antigen recognition.

Other methods monitor the binding of the antibody to antigen fragments (e.g. proteolytic fragments) or to mutated variations of the antigen where loss of binding due to a modification of an amino acid residue within the antigen sequence is often considered an indication of an epitope component, such as alanine scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham &#x26; Wells (1985) <i>Science </i>244:1081) or yeast display of mutant target sequence variants (see Example 4 herein). In addition, computational combinatorial methods for epitope mapping can also be used. These methods rely on the ability of the antibody of interest to affinity isolate specific short peptides from combinatorial phage display peptide libraries.

Whether two antibodies compete with each other for binding to a target, i.e., whether and to what extent one antibody inhibits the binding of the other antibody to a target, may be determined using known competition experiments. In certain embodiments, an antibody competes with, and inhibits binding of another antibody to a target by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 100%. The level of inhibition or competition may be different depending on which antibody is the &#x201c;blocking antibody&#x201d; (i.e., the cold antibody that is incubated first with the target).

Typically, the antibody (i) binds with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of approximately less than 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M, such as approximately less than 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>M or 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M or even lower when determined by, e.g., surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in a BIACORE&#xae; 2000 surface plasmon resonance instrument using the predetermined antigen, e.g., recombinant human TIGIT, as the analyte and the antibody as the ligand, or Scatchard analysis of binding of the antibody to antigen positive cells, and (ii) binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen. Accordingly, an antibody that &#x201c;specifically binds to human TIGIT&#x201d; refers to an antibody that binds to soluble or cell bound human TIGIT with a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M or less, such as approximately less than 10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>M or 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M or even lower. An antibody that &#x201c;cross-reacts with cynomolgus TIGIT&#x201d; refers to an antibody that binds to cynomolgus TIGIT with a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M or less, such as approximately less than 10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>M or 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M or even lower.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">The term &#x201c;k<sub>assoc</sub>&#x201d; or &#x201c;k<sub>a</sub>&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to the association rate constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction, whereas the term &#x201c;k<sub>dis</sub>&#x201d; or &#x201c;k<sub>d</sub>,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the dissociation rate constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. The term &#x201c;K<sub>D</sub>&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant, which is obtained from the ratio of k<sub>d </sub>to k<sub>a </sub>(i.e., k<sub>d</sub>/k<sub>a</sub>) and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). K<sub>D </sub>values for antibodies can be determined using methods well established in the art. Preferred methods for determining the K<sub>D </sub>of an antibody include biolayer interferometry (BLI) analysis, preferably using a Fortebio Octet RED device, surface plasmon resonance, preferably using a biosensor system such as a BIACORE&#xae; surface plasmon resonance system (see e.g. Example 2), or flow cytometry and Scatchard analysis.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">As used herein, the term &#x201c;high affinity&#x201d; for an IgG antibody refers to an antibody having a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>M or less, more preferably 10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>M or less and even more preferably 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M or less for a target antigen. However, &#x201c;high affinity&#x201d; binding can vary for other antibody isotypes. For example, &#x201c;high affinity&#x201d; binding for an IgM isotype refers to an antibody having a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M or less, more preferably 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>M or less.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">The term &#x201c;EC50&#x201d; in the context of an in vitro or in vivo assay using an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof, refers to the concentration of an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that induces a response that is 50% of the maximal response, i.e., halfway between the maximal response and the baseline.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">The term &#x201c;binds to immobilized TIGIT&#x201d; refers to the ability of an antibody described herein to bind to TIGIT, for example, expressed on the surface of a cell or attached to a solid support.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">The term &#x201c;cross-reacts,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the ability of an antibody described herein to bind to TIGIT from a different species. For example, an antibody described herein that binds human TIGIT may also bind TIGIT from another species (e.g., cynomolgus TIGIT). As used herein, cross-reactivity may be measured by detecting a specific reactivity with purified antigen in binding assays (e.g., SPR, ELISA) or binding to, or otherwise functionally interacting with, cells physiologically expressing TIGIT. Methods for determining cross-reactivity include standard binding assays as described herein, for example, by BIACORE&#xae; surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis using a BIACORE&#xae; 2000 SPR instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden), or flow cytometric techniques.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">The term &#x201c;naturally-occurring&#x201d; as used herein as applied to an object refers to the fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory is naturally-occurring.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">A &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; refers to a chain comprising at least two consecutively linked amino acid residues, with no upper limit on the length of the chain. One or more amino acid residues in the protein may contain a modification such as, but not limited to, glycosylation, phosphorylation or a disulfide bond. A &#x201c;protein&#x201d; may comprise one or more polypeptides.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">The term &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule,&#x201d; as used herein, is intended to include DNA molecules and RNA molecules. A nucleic acid molecule may be single-stranded or double-stranded, and may be cDNA.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">Also provided are &#x201c;conservative sequence modifications&#x201d; to the antibody sequence provided herein, i.e. nucleotide and amino acid sequence modifications that do not abrogate the binding of the antibody encoded by the nucleotide sequence or containing the amino acid sequence, to the antigen. For example, modifications can be introduced by standard techniques known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Conservative sequence modifications include conservative amino acid substitutions, in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in an anti-TIGIT antibody is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Methods of identifying nucleotide and amino acid conservative substitutions that do not eliminate antigen binding are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Brummell et al., <i>Biochem. </i>32:1180-1187 (1993); Kobayashi et al. <i>Protein Eng. </i>12(10):879-884 (1999); and Burks et al. <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm, as described in the non-limiting examples below.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">The percent identity between two nucleotide sequences can be determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package, using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The percent identity between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences can also be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller (CABIOS, 4:11-17 (1989)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. In addition, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined using the Needleman and Wunsch (<i>J. Mol. Biol</i>.

One type of vector is a &#x201c;plasmid,&#x201d; which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as &#x201c;recombinant expression vectors&#x201d; (or simply, &#x201c;expression vectors&#x201d;). In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, &#x201c;plasmid&#x201d; and &#x201c;vector&#x201d; may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However, also included are other forms of expression vectors, such as viral vectors (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), which serve equivalent functions.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">The term &#x201c;recombinant host cell&#x201d; (or simply &#x201c;host cell&#x201d;), as used herein, is intended to refer to a cell that comprises a nucleic acid that is not naturally present in the cell, and may be a cell into which a recombinant expression vector has been introduced. It should be understood that such terms are intended to refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term &#x201c;host cell&#x201d; as used herein.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">An &#x201c;immune response&#x201d; refers to a biological response within a vertebrate against foreign agents, which response protects the organism against these agents and diseases caused by them. An immune response is mediated by the action of a cell of the immune system (for example, a T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, natural killer (NK) cell, macrophage, eosinophil, mast cell, dendritic cell or neutrophil) and soluble macromolecules produced by any of these cells or the liver (including antibodies, cytokines, and complement) that results in selective targeting, binding to, damage to, destruction of, and/or elimination from the vertebrate's body of invading pathogens, cells or tissues infected with pathogens, cancerous or other abnormal cells, or, in cases of autoimmunity or pathological inflammation, normal human cells or tissues. An immune reaction includes, e.g., activation or inhibition of a T cell, e.g., an effector T cell or a Th cell, such as a CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell, or the inhibition or depletion of a T<sub>reg </sub>cell. &#x201c;T effector&#x201d; (&#x201c;T<sub>eff</sub>&#x201d;) cells refers to T cells (e.g., CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) with cytolytic activities as well as T helper (Th) cells, which secrete cytokines and activate and direct other immune cells, but does not include regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg </sub>cells).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">As used herein, the term &#x201c;T cell-mediated response&#x201d; refers to a response mediated by T cells, including effector T cells (e.g., CD8<sup>+</sup> cells) and helper T cells (e.g., CD4<sup>+</sup> cells).

Such modulation includes stimulation or suppression of the immune system, which may be manifested by an increase or decrease in the number of various cell types, an increase or decrease in the activity of these cells, or any other changes that can occur within the immune system. Both inhibitory and stimulatory immunomodulators have been identified, some of which may have enhanced function in a tumor microenvironment. In preferred embodiments, the immunomodulator is located on the surface of a T cell. An &#x201c;immunomodulatory target&#x201d; or &#x201c;immunoregulatory target&#x201d; is an immunomodulator that is targeted for binding by, and whose activity is altered by the binding of, a substance, agent, moiety, compound or molecule. Immunomodulatory targets include, for example, receptors on the surface of a cell (&#x201c;immunomodulatory receptors&#x201d;) and receptor ligands (&#x201c;immunomodulatory ligands&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">&#x201c;Immunotherapy&#x201d; refers to the treatment of a subject afflicted with, or at risk of contracting or suffering a recurrence of, a disease by a method comprising inducing, enhancing, suppressing or otherwise modifying an immune response.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0114">&#x201c;Immunostimulating therapy&#x201d; or &#x201c;immunostimulatory therapy&#x201d; refers to a therapy that results in increasing (inducing or enhancing) an immune response in a subject for, e.g., treating cancer.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0115">&#x201c;Potentiating an endogenous immune response&#x201d; means increasing the effectiveness or potency of an existing immune response in a subject.

Hematological malignancies also include leukemia, such as, but not limited to, secondary leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Hematological malignancies further include myelomas, such as, but not limited to, multiple myeloma and smoldering multiple myeloma. Other hematological and/or B cell- or T-cell-associated cancers are encompassed by the term hematological malignancy.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">The terms &#x201c;treat,&#x201d; &#x201c;treating,&#x201d; and &#x201c;treatment,&#x201d; as used herein, refer to any type of intervention or process performed on, or administering an active agent to, the subject with the objective of reversing, alleviating, ameliorating, inhibiting, or slowing down or preventing the progression, development, severity or recurrence of a symptom, complication, condition or biochemical indicia associated with a disease. Prophylaxis refers to administration to a subject who does not have a disease, to prevent the disease from occurring or minimize its effects if it does.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">The term &#x201c;effective dose&#x201d; or &#x201c;effective dosage&#x201d; is defined as an amount sufficient to achieve or at least partially achieve a desired effect. A &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; or &#x201c;therapeutically effective dosage&#x201d; of a drug or therapeutic agent is any amount of the drug that, when used alone or in combination with another therapeutic agent, promotes disease regression evidenced by a decrease in severity of disease symptoms, an increase in frequency and duration of disease symptom-free periods, or a prevention of impairment or disability due to the disease affliction. A &#x201c;prophylactically effective amount&#x201d; or a &#x201c;prophylactically effective dosage&#x201d; of a drug is an amount of the drug that, when administered alone or in combination with another therapeutic agent to a subject at risk of developing a disease or of suffering a recurrence of disease, inhibits the development or recurrence of the disease. The ability of a therapeutic or prophylactic agent to promote disease regression or inhibit the development or recurrence of the disease can be evaluated using a variety of methods known to the skilled practitioner, such as in human subjects during clinical trials, in animal model systems predictive of efficacy in humans, or by assaying the activity of the agent in in vitro assays.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">By way of example, an anti-cancer agent is a drug that slows cancer progression or promotes cancer regression in a subject. In preferred embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of the drug promotes cancer regression to the point of eliminating the cancer. &#x201c;Promoting cancer regression&#x201d; means that administering an effective amount of the drug, alone or in combination with an anti-neoplastic agent, results in a reduction in tumor growth or size, necrosis of the tumor, a decrease in severity of at least one disease symptom, an increase in frequency and duration of disease symptom-free periods, a prevention of impairment or disability due to the disease affliction, or otherwise amelioration of disease symptoms in the patient. Pharmacological effectiveness refers to the ability of the drug to promote cancer regression in the patient.

In the most preferred embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount or dosage of the drug completely inhibits cell growth or tumor growth, i.e., preferably inhibits cell growth or tumor growth by 100%. The ability of a compound to inhibit tumor growth can be evaluated using the assays described infra. Inhibition of tumor growth may not be immediate after treatment, and may only occur after a period of time or after repeated administration. Alternatively, this property of a composition can be evaluated by examining the ability of the compound to inhibit cell growth, such inhibition can be measured in vitro by assays known to the skilled practitioner. In other preferred embodiments described herein, tumor regression may be observed and may continue for a period of at least about 20 days, more preferably at least about 40 days, or even more preferably at least about 60 days.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">&#x201c;Combination&#x201d; therapy, as used herein, unless otherwise clear from the context, is meant to encompass administration of two or more therapeutic agents in a coordinated fashion, and includes, but is not limited to, concurrent dosing. Specifically, combination therapy encompasses both co-administration (e.g. administration of a co-formulation or simultaneous administration of separate therapeutic compositions) and serial or sequential administration, provided that administration of one therapeutic agent is conditioned in some way on administration of another therapeutic agent. For example, one therapeutic agent may be administered only after a different therapeutic agent has been administered and allowed to act for a prescribed period of time. See, e.g., Kohrt et al.

Anti-TIGIT Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0130" num="0128">The present application discloses fully human anti-huTIGIT antibodies having desirable properties for use as therapeutic agents in treating diseases such as cancers. These properties include one or more of the ability to bind to human TIGIT with high affinity, the ability to bind to cynomolgus monkey TIGIT, the ability to block PVR binding (and thus signaling), and the absence of sequence liabilities that might reduce the chemical stability of the antibody.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129">The anti-TIGIT antibodies disclosed herein by sequence bind to specific epitopes on human TIGIT determined as described in Example 4 and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>. The three specific antibodies for which epitopes were determined bind at similar regions of human TIGIT but differ in which specific amino acid residues are contacted. The antibodies share the properties of binding to human TIGIT with high affinity and having the ability to block PVR binding. Accordingly, other antibodies that bind to the same or closely related epitopes would likely share these desirable properties, and may be discovered by competition experiments.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">In addition, antibody 22G2 binds to cynomolgus monkey TIGIT with substantially the same affinity as it binds to human TIGIT, which is convenient when it is necessary to perform toxicity studies in support of regulatory approval for use of the antibody as a human therapeutic. Other anti-TIGIT antibodies that bind to the same or similar epitopes as 15A6 and 22G2 are likely to share this advantageous property of binding to cyno TIGIT. Antibodies binding to similar epitopes can be discovered by doing competition experiments or by determining their epitopes directly.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0000">Anti-TIGIT Antibodies that Compete with Anti-huTIGIT Antibodies Disclosed Herein</p><p id="p-0134" num="0131">Anti-huTIGIT antibodies that compete with the antibodies of the present invention for binding to huTIGIT, such as 15A6 and 22G2, may be raised using immunization protocols similar to those described herein (Example 1). Antibodies that compete for binding with the anti-huTIGIT antibodies described herein may also be generated immunizing mice may with human TIGIT or a construct comprising the extracellular domain thereof (residues 22-141 of SEQ ID NO: 1; NP 776160.2), or by immunizing with a fragment of human TIGIT containing the epitope bound by the anti-huTIGIT antibodies disclosed herein (e.g. 15A6, 22G2 and 11G11). The resulting antibodies can be screened for the ability to block binding of 15A6 or 22G2 to human TIGIT by methods well known in the art, for example blocking binding to fusion protein of the extracellular domain of TIGIT and an immunoglobulin Fc domain in a ELISA, or blocking the ability to bind to cells expressing huTIGIT on their surface, e.g. by FACS. In various embodiments, the test antibody is contacted with the TIGIT-Fc fusion protein (or to cells expressing huTIGIT on their surface) prior to, at the same time as, or after the addition of 15A6 or 22G2. For example, &#x201c;binning&#x201d; experiments may be performed (Example 3) to determine whether an antibody falls into the same &#x201c;bin&#x201d; as antibodies 15A6 or 22G2, in which experiments antibodies 15A6 or 22G2 are referred to as the &#x201c;reference&#x201d; antibodies, and the antibodies to be tested are referred to as the &#x201c;test&#x201d; antibodies. Antibodies that reduce binding of 15A6 and/or 22G2 to TIGIT (either as an Fc fusion or on a cell), particularly at roughly stoichiometric concentrations, are likely to bind at the same, overlapping, or adjacent epitopes, and thus may share the desirable functional properties of 15A6 and 22G2.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0132">Competing antibodies can also be identified using other methods known in the art. For example, standard ELISA assays or competitive ELISA assays can be used in which a recombinant human TIGIT protein construct is immobilized on the plate, various concentrations of unlabeled test antibody are added, the plate is washed, labeled reference antibody is added, washed, and the amount of bound label is measured. If the increasing concentration of the unlabeled test antibody inhibits the binding of the labeled reference antibody, the test antibody is said to inhibit the binding of the reference antibody to the target on the plate, or is said to compete with the binding of the reference antibody. Additionally or alternatively, BIACORE&#xae; SPR analysis can be used to assess the ability of the antibodies to compete. The ability of a test antibody to inhibit the binding of an anti-huTIGIT antibody described herein to TIGIT demonstrates that the test antibody can compete with the reference antibody for binding to TIGIT.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0133">Accordingly, provided herein are anti-TIGIT antibodies that inhibit the binding of an anti-huTIGIT antibodies described herein to TIGIT on cells, e.g., activated T cells, by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or by 100% and/or whose binding to TIGIT on cells, e.g., activated T cells, is inhibited by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or by 100%, e.g., as measured by ELISA or FACS, such as by using the assay described in the following paragraph.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0134">An exemplary competition experiment to determine whether a test antibody blocks the binding of (i.e., &#x201c;competes with&#x201d;) a reference antibody, may be conducted as follows: activated human T cells are prepared as follows: Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) are isolated from human whole blood using Ficoll gradient and activated with 10 &#x3bc;g/mL phytohaemagglutinin (PHA-L) (USBiol#P3370-30) and 200 IU/mL recombinant IL-2 (Peprotech#200-02) for 3 days. The activated T cells are resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 5% Fetal Bovine Serum) and seeded at 10<sup>5 </sup>cells per sample well in a 96 well plate. Unconjugated test antibody is added to the plate at concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 &#x3bc;g/mL (three-fold titration starting from a highest concentration of 50 &#x3bc;g/mL). An unrelated IgG may be used as an isotype control for the test antibody and added at the same concentrations (three-fold titration starting from a highest concentration of 50 &#x3bc;g/mL). A sample pre-incubated with 50 &#x3bc;g/mL unlabeled reference antibody may be included as a positive control for complete blocking (100% inhibition) and a sample without antibody in the primary incubation may be used as a negative control (no competition; 0% inhibition). After 30 minutes of incubation, labeled, e.g., biotinylated, reference antibody is added at a concentration of 2 &#x3bc;g/mL per well without washing. Samples are incubated for another 30 minutes. Unbound antibodies are removed by washing the cells with FACS buffer. Cell-bound labeled reference antibody is detected with an agent that detects the label, e.g., PE conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen, catalog#521388) for detecting biotin. The samples are acquired on a FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer (BD, San Jose) and analyzed with Flowjo software (Tree Star, Inc, Ashland, Oreg.). The results may be represented as the % inhibition (i.e., subtracting from 100% the amount of label at each concentration divided by the amount of label obtained with no blocking antibody).</p><p id="p-0138" num="0135">Typically, the same experiment is then conducted in the reverse, i.e., the test antibody is the reference antibody and the reference antibody is the test antibody.

A test and a reference antibody &#x201c;cross-block&#x201d; binding of each other to the target when the antibodies compete with each other both ways, i.e., in competition experiments in which the test antibody is added first and in competition experiments in which the reference antibody is added first.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0136">Anti-huTIGIT antibodies are considered to compete with the anti-huTIGIT antibodies disclosed herein if they inhibit binding of 15A6 and/or 22G2 to human TIGIT by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or by 100% when present at roughly equal concentrations, for example in competition experiments like those described in Example 3. Unless indicated otherwise, an antibody will be considered to compete with an antibody selected from the group consisting of the anti-huTIGIT antibodies of the present invention if it reduces binding of the selected antibody to human TIGIT by at least 20% when used at a roughly equal molar concentration with the selected antibody, as measured in competition ELISA experiments as outlined in the preceding two paragraphs.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0000">Anti-TIGIT Antibodies that Bind to the Same Epitope</p><p id="p-0141" num="0137">Anti-huTIGIT antibodies that bind to the same or similar epitopes to the antibodies disclosed herein may be raised using immunization protocols similar to those described herein (Example 1). The resulting antibodies can be screened for high affinity binding to human TIGIT (Example 2). Selected antibodies can then be studied in yeast display assay in which sequence variants of huTIGIT are presented on the surface of yeast cells (Example 4) to determine the precise epitope bound by the antibody.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0138">Epitope determinations may be made by any method known in the art. The epitopes disclosed herein were determined by yeast display, as described at Example 4 and presented at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>. In various embodiments, anti-huTIGIT antibodies are considered to bind to the same epitope as an anti-huTIGIT mAb disclosed herein, e.g. 15A6 and/or 22G2, if they make contact with one or more of the same residues within at least one region of huTIGIT contacted by 15A6 or 22G2; if they make contacts with a majority of the residues within at least one region of huTIGIT contacted by 15A6 or 22G2; if they make contacts with a majority of the residues within each region of huTIGIT contacted by 15A6 or 22G2; if they make contact with a majority of contacts along the entire length of huTIGIT contacted by 15A6 or 22G2; if they make contacts within all of the distinct regions of human TIGIT contacted by 15A6 or 22G2; if they make contact with all of the same residues at any one region on human TIGIT contacted by 15A6 or 22G2; or if they make contact with all residues at all regions contacted by contacted by 15A6 or 22G2. Epitope &#x201c;regions&#x201d; are clusters of residues along the primary sequence that are contacted by antibodies 15A6 or 22G2, e.g. as provided at SEQ ID NOs: 38-44.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0139">Techniques for determining antibodies that bind to the &#x201c;same epitope on TIGIT&#x201d; with the antibodies described herein include x-ray analyses of crystals of antigen:antibody complexes, which provides atomic resolution of the epitope. Other methods monitor the binding of the antibody to antigen fragments or mutated variations of the antigen where loss of binding due to a modification of an amino acid residue within the antigen sequence is considered an indication of an epitope component. Methods may also rely on the ability of an antibody of interest to affinity isolate specific short peptides (either in native three dimensional form or in denatured form) from combinatorial phage display peptide libraries, or from a protease digest of the target protein. The peptides are then regarded as leads for the definition of the epitope corresponding to the antibody used to screen the peptide library. For epitope mapping, computational algorithms have also been developed that have been shown to map conformational discontinuous epitopes.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0140">The epitope or region comprising the epitope can also be identified by screening for binding to a series of overlapping peptides spanning TIGIT. Alternatively, the method of Jespers et al. (1994) <i>Biotechnology </i>12:899 may be used to guide the selection of antibodies having the same epitope and therefore similar properties to the an anti-TIGIT antibodies described herein. Using phage display, first the heavy chain of the anti-TIGIT antibody is paired with a repertoire of (preferably human) light chains to select a TIGIT-binding antibody, and then the new light chain is paired with a repertoire of (preferably human) heavy chains to select a (preferably human) TIGIT-binding antibody having the same epitope or epitope region as an anti-huTIGIT antibody described herein. Alternatively variants of an antibody described herein can be obtained by mutagenesis of cDNA encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0141">Alanine scanning mutagenesis, as described by Cunningham &#x26; Wells (1989) <i>Science </i>244: 1081, or some other form of point mutagenesis of amino acid residues in TIGIT (such as the yeast display method provided at Example 4) may also be used to determine the functional epitope for an anti-TIGIT antibody.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0142">The epitope or epitope region (an &#x201c;epitope region&#x201d; is a region comprising the epitope or overlapping with the epitope) bound by a specific antibody may also be determined by assessing binding of the antibody to peptides comprising fragments of TIGIT. A series of overlapping peptides encompassing the sequence of TIGIT (e.g., human TIGIT) may be synthesized and screened for binding, e.g. in a direct ELISA, a competitive ELISA (where the peptide is assessed for its ability to prevent binding of an antibody to TIGIT bound to a well of a microtiter plate), or on a chip. Such peptide screening methods may not be capable of detecting some discontinuous functional epitopes, i.e. functional epitopes that involve amino acid residues that are not contiguous along the primary sequence of the TIGIT polypeptide chain.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0143">An epitope may also be identified by MS-based protein footprinting, such as hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and Fast Photochemical Oxidation of Proteins (FPOP).

Such systems include immunizing a transgenic mouse carrying human immunoglobulin genes with the antigen of interest or screening a human immunoglobulin gene library displayed on phage with the antigen of interest. The human germline immunoglobulin sequence(s) from which the sequence of an antibody is &#x201c;derived&#x201d; can be identified by comparing the amino acid sequence of the human antibody to the amino acid sequences of human germline immunoglobulins and selecting the human germline immunoglobulin sequence that is closest in sequence (i.e., greatest % identity) to the sequence of the human antibody. A human antibody that is &#x201c;derived from&#x201d; a particular human germline immunoglobulin sequence may contain amino acid differences as compared to the germline sequence due to, for example, naturally-occurring somatic mutations or intentional introduction of site-directed mutation. However, a selected human antibody typically is at least 90% identical in amino acids sequence to an amino acid sequence encoded by a human germline immunoglobulin gene (e.g. V regions) and contains amino acid residues that identify the human antibody as being human when compared to the germline immunoglobulin amino acid sequences of other species (e.g., murine germline sequences). In certain cases, a human antibody may be at least 95%, or even at least 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical in amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline immunoglobulin gene (e.g. V regions). Typically, a human antibody derived from a particular human germline sequence will display no more than 10 amino acid differences from the amino acid sequence encoded by the human germline immunoglobulin gene (e.g. V regions).

An antibody can be engineered by modifying one or more residues within one or both variable regions (i.e., V<sub>H </sub>and/or V<sub>L</sub>), for example within one or more CDR regions and/or within one or more framework regions. Additionally or alternatively, an antibody can be engineered by modifying residues within the constant region(s), for example to alter the effector function(s) of the antibody.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0153">One type of variable region engineering that can be performed is CDR grafting. Such grafting is of particular use in humanizing non-human anti-TIGIT antibodies that compete for binding with the anti-huTIGIT antibodies disclosed herein and/or bind to the same epitope as the anti-huTIGIT antibodies disclosed herein. Antibodies interact with target antigens predominantly through amino acid residues that are located in the six heavy and light chain complementarity determining regions (CDRs). For this reason, the amino acid sequences within CDRs are more diverse between individual antibodies than sequences outside of CDRs. Because CDR sequences are responsible for most antibody-antigen interactions, it is possible to express recombinant antibodies that mimic the properties of specific reference antibodies by constructing expression vectors that include CDR sequences from the specific reference antibody grafted onto framework sequences from a different antibody with different properties (see, e.g., Riechmann, L. et al.

For example, it has been found that in certain instances it is beneficial to mutate residues within the framework regions to maintain or enhance the antigen binding ability of the antibody (see e.g., U.S. Pat.

Often such framework modifications are made to decrease the immunogenicity of the antibody. For example, one approach is to &#x201c;backmutate&#x201d; one or more framework residues to the corresponding germline sequence. More specifically, an antibody that has undergone somatic mutation may contain framework residues that differ from the germline sequence from which the antibody is derived. Such residues can be identified by comparing the antibody framework sequences to the germline sequences from which the antibody is derived. To return the framework region sequences to their germline configuration, the somatic mutations can be &#x201c;backmutated&#x201d; to the germline sequence by, for example, site-directed mutagenesis or PCR-mediated mutagenesis.

In one embodiment, a blocking peptide &#x201c;mask&#x201d; is generated that specifically binds to the antigen binding surface of the antibody and interferes with antigen binding, which mask is linked to each of the binding arms of the antibody by a peptidase cleavable linker. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 8,518,404 to CytomX. Such constructs are useful for treatment of cancers in which protease levels are greatly increased in the tumor microenvironment compared with non-tumor tissues. Selective cleavage of the cleavable linker in the tumor microenvironment allows disassociation of the masking/blocking peptide, enabling antigen binding selectively in the tumor, rather than in peripheral tissues in which antigen binding might cause unwanted side effects.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0163">Alternatively, in a related embodiment, a bivalent binding compound (&#x201c;masking ligand&#x201d;) comprising two antigen binding domains is developed that binds to both antigen binding surfaces of the (bivalent) antibody and interfere with antigen binding, in which the two binding domains masks are linked to each other (but not the antibody) by a cleavable linker, for example cleavable by a peptidase. See, e.g., Int'l Pat. App. Pub. No. WO 2010/077643 to Tegopharm Corp. Masking ligands may comprise, or be derived from, the antigen to which the antibody is intended to bind, or may be independently generated. Such masking ligands are useful for treatment of cancers in which protease levels are greatly increased in the tumor microenvironment compared with non-tumor tissues. Selective cleavage of the cleavable linker in the tumor microenvironment allows disassociation of the two binding domains from each other, reducing the avidity for the antigen-binding surfaces of the antibody. The resulting dissociation of the masking ligand from the antibody enables antigen binding selectively in the tumor, rather than in peripheral tissues in which antigen binding might cause unwanted side effects.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Fcs and Modified Fcs</heading><p id="p-0170" num="0164">In addition to the activity of a therapeutic antibody arising from binding of the antigen binding domain to the antigen (e.g. blocking of a cognate ligand or receptor protein in the case of antagonist antibodies, or induced signaling in the case of agonist antibodies), the Fc portion of the antibody interact with the immune system generally in complex ways to elicit any number of biological effects. Effector functions, such as The Fe region of an immunoglobulin is responsible for many important antibody functions, such as antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP), result in killing of target cells, albeit by different mechanisms. There are five major classes, or isotypes, of heavy chain constant region (IgA, IgG IgD, IgE, IgM), each with characteristic effector functions. These isotypes can be further subdivided into subclasses, for example, IgG is separated into four subclasses known as IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. IgG molecules interact with three classes of Fc&#x3b3; receptors (Fc&#x3b3;R) specific for the IgG class of antibody, namely Fc&#x3b3;RI, Fc&#x3b3;RII, and Fc&#x3b3;RIII. The important sequences for the binding of IgG to the Fc&#x3b3;R receptors have been reported to be located in the CH2 and CH3 domains.

The sequences of human heavy chain constant region genes are known in the art (see e.g., Kabat, E. A., el al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242) and DNA fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard PCR amplification. The heavy chain constant region can be an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, IgE, IgM or IgD constant region, for example, an IgG1 region. For a Fab fragment heavy chain gene, the VH-encoding DNA can be operatively linked to another DNA molecule encoding only the heavy chain CH1 constant region.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0212">The isolated DNA encoding the VL region can be converted to a full-length light chain gene (as well as a Fab light chain gene) by operatively linking the VL-encoding DNA to another DNA molecule encoding the light chain constant region, CL.

(1994) <i>Nature </i>368(6474): 856-859; Fishwild et al. (1996) <i>Nature Biotechnology </i>14: 845-851 and WO 98/24884. Alternatively, mice can be immunized with DNA encoding human TIGIT. Preferably, the mice will be 6-16 weeks of age upon the first infusion. For example, a purified or enriched preparation (5-50 &#x3bc;g) of the recombinant TIGIT antigen can be used to immunize the HuMAb mice intraperitoneally. In the event that immunizations using a purified or enriched preparation of the TIGIT antigen do not result in antibodies, mice can also be immunized with cells expressing TIGIT, e.g., a cell line, to promote immune responses. Exemplary cell lines include TIGIT-overexpressing stable CHO and Raji cell lines.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0226">Cumulative experience with various antigens has shown that the HuMAb transgenic mice respond best when initially immunized intraperitoneally (IP) or subcutaneously (SC) with antigen in Ribi's adjuvant, followed by every other week IP/SC immunizations (up to a total of 10) with antigen in Ribi's adjuvant. The immune response can be monitored over the course of the immunization protocol with plasma samples being obtained by retroorbital bleeds. The plasma can be screened by ELISA and FACS (as described below), and mice with sufficient titers of anti-TIGIT human immunoglobulin can be used for fusions. Mice can be boosted intravenously with antigen 3 days before sacrifice and removal of the spleen and lymph nodes. It is expected that 2-3 fusions for each immunization may need to be performed. Between 6 and 24 mice are typically immunized for each antigen. Usually, HCo7, HCo12, and KM strains are used. In addition, both HCo7 and HCo12 transgene can be bred together into a single mouse having two different human heavy chain transgenes (HCo7/HCo12).</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">Generation of Hybridomas Producing Monoclonal Antibodies to TIGIT</heading><p id="p-0233" num="0227">To generate hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies described herein, splenocytes and/or lymph node cells from immunized mice can be isolated and fused to an appropriate immortalized cell line, such as a mouse myeloma cell line. The resulting hybridomas can be screened for the production of antigen-specific antibodies. For example, single cell suspensions of splenic lymphocytes from immunized mice can be fused to Sp2/0 nonsecreting mouse myeloma cells (ATCC, CRL 1581) with 50% PEG. Cells are plated at approximately 2&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>in flat bottom microtiter plate, followed by a two week incubation in selective medium containing 10% fetal Clone Serum, 18% &#x201c;653&#x201d; conditioned media, 5% origen (IGEN), 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5 mM HEPES, 0.055 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 mg/ml gentamycin and 1&#xd7;HAT (Sigma). After approximately two weeks, cells can be cultured in medium in which the HAT is replaced with HT. Individual wells can then be screened by ELISA for human monoclonal IgM and IgG antibodies. Once extensive hybridoma growth occurs, medium can be observed usually after 10-14 days. The antibody secreting hybridomas can be replated, screened again, and if still positive for human IgG, the monoclonal antibodies can be subcloned at least twice by limiting dilution.

Antibody Manufacture</heading><heading id="h-0024" level="2">Generation of Transfectomas Producing Monoclonal Antibodies to TIGIT</heading><p id="p-0235" num="0229">Antibodies of the present invention, including both specific antibodies for which sequences are provided and other, related anti-TIGIT antibodies, can be produced in a host cell transfectoma using, for example, a combination of recombinant DNA techniques and gene transfection methods as is well known in the art (Morrison, S. (1985) Science 229:1202).</p><p id="p-0236" num="0230">For example, to express antibodies, or antibody fragments thereof, DNAs encoding partial or full-length light and heavy chains, can be obtained by standard molecular biology techniques (e.g., PCR amplification or cDNA cloning using a hybridoma that expresses the antibody of interest) and the DNAs can be inserted into expression vectors such that the genes are operatively linked to transcriptional and translational control sequences. In this context, the term &#x201c;operatively linked&#x201d; is intended to mean that an antibody gene is ligated into a vector such that transcriptional and translational control sequences within the vector serve their intended function of regulating the transcription and translation of the antibody gene. The expression vector and expression control sequences are chosen to be compatible with the expression host cell used. The antibody light chain gene and the antibody heavy chain gene can be inserted into separate vector or both genes are inserted into the same expression vector. The antibody genes are inserted into the expression vector(s) by standard methods (e.g., ligation of complementary restriction sites on the antibody gene fragment and vector, or blunt end ligation if no restriction sites are present). The light and heavy chain variable regions of the antibodies described herein can be used to create full-length antibody genes of any antibody isotype by inserting them into expression vectors already encoding heavy chain constant and light chain constant regions of the desired isotype such that the V<sub>H </sub>segment is operatively linked to the C<sub>H </sub>segment(s) within the vector and the V<sub>L </sub>segment is operatively linked to the C<sub>L </sub>segment within the vector. Additionally or alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can encode a signal peptide that facilitates secretion of the antibody chain from a host cell. The antibody chain gene can be cloned into the vector such that the signal peptide is linked in-frame to the amino terminus of the antibody chain gene. The signal peptide can be an immunoglobulin signal peptide or a heterologous signal peptide (i.e., a signal peptide from a non-immunoglobulin protein).</p><p id="p-0237" num="0231">In addition to the antibody chain genes, recombinant expression vectors may carry regulatory sequences that control the expression of the antibody chain genes in a host cell. The term &#x201c;regulatory sequence&#x201d; is intended to include promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements (e.g., polyadenylation signals) that control the transcription or translation of the antibody chain genes. Such regulatory sequences are described, for example, in Goeddel (Gene Expression Technology. Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990)). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector, including the selection of regulatory sequences, may depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, etc. Preferred regulatory sequences for mammalian host cell expression include viral elements that direct high levels of protein expression in mammalian cells, such as promoters and/or enhancers derived from cytomegalovirus (CMV), Simian Virus 40 (SV40), adenovirus, (e.g., the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) and polyoma. Alternatively, nonviral regulatory sequences may be used, such as the ubiquitin promoter or &#x3b2;-globin promoter. Still further, regulatory elements composed of sequences from different sources, such as the SR&#x3b1; promoter system, which contains sequences from the SV40 early promoter and the long terminal repeat of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (Takebe, Y. et al. (1988) <i>Mol. Cell. Biol. </i>8:466-472).</p><p id="p-0238" num="0232">In addition to the antibody chain genes and regulatory sequences, recombinant expression vectors may carry additional sequences, such as sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host cells (e.g., origins of replication) and selectable marker genes. The selectable marker gene facilitates selection of host cells into which the vector has been introduced (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,634,665 and 5,179,017, all by Axel et al.). For example, typically the selectable marker gene confers resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin or methotrexate, on a host cell into which the vector has been introduced. Preferred selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene (for use in dhfr-host cells with methotrexate selection/amplification) and the neo gene (for G418 selection).</p><p id="p-0239" num="0233">For expression of the light and heavy chains, the expression vector(s) encoding the heavy and light chains is transfected into a host cell by standard techniques. The various forms of the term &#x201c;transfection&#x201d; are intended to encompass a wide variety of techniques commonly used for the introduction of exogenous DNA into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell, e.g., electroporation, calcium-phosphate precipitation, DEAE-dextran transfection and the like. Although it is theoretically possible to express the antibodies described herein in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells, expression of antibodies in eukaryotic cells, and most preferably mammalian host cells, is the most preferred because such eukaryotic cells, and in particular mammalian cells, are more likely than prokaryotic cells to assemble and secrete a properly folded and immunologically active antibody. Prokaryotic expression of antibody genes has been reported to be ineffective for production of high yields of active antibody (Boss, M. A. and Wood, C. R. (1985) <i>Immunology Today </i>6:12-13). Antibodies of the present invention can also be produced in glycoengineered strains of the yeast <i>Pichia pastoris</i>. Li et al. (2006) <i>Nat. Biotechnol. </i>24:210.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0234">Preferred mammalian host cells for expressing the recombinant antibodies described herein include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) (including dhfr-CHO cells, described in Urlaub and Chasin, (1980) <i>Proc.

Biol. 159:601-621), NSO myeloma cells, COS cells and SP2 cells. In particular, for use with NSO myeloma cells, another preferred expression system is the GS gene expression system disclosed in WO 87/04462, WO 89/01036 and EP 338,841. When recombinant expression vectors encoding antibody genes are introduced into mammalian host cells, the antibodies are produced by culturing the host cells for a period of time sufficient to allow for expression of the antibody in the host cells or, more preferably, secretion of the antibody into the culture medium in which the host cells are grown. Antibodies can be recovered from the culture medium using standard protein purification methods.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0235">The N- and C-termini of antibody polypeptide chains of the present invention may differ from the expected sequence due to commonly observed post-translational modifications. For example, C-terminal lysine residues are often missing from antibody heavy chains. Dick et al. (2008) <i>Biotechnol. Bioeng. </i>100:1132. N-terminal glutamine residues, and to a lesser extent glutamate residues, are frequently converted to pyroglutamate residues on both light and heavy chains of therapeutic antibodies. Dick et al.

However, in an alternative embodiment, each heavy chain for the anti-huTIGIT antibodies of the present invention, and/or genetic construct encoding such antibodies or the heavy or light chains thereof, includes this additional lysine residue at the C-terminus of the heavy chain(s).</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">VII. Assays</heading><p id="p-0243" num="0237">Antibodies described herein can be tested for binding to TIGIT by, for example, standard ELISA. Briefly, microtiter plates are coated with purified TIGIT at 1-2 &#x3bc;g/ml in PBS, and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Dilutions of antibody (e.g., dilutions of plasma from TIGIT-immunized mice) are added to each well and incubated for 1-2 hours at 37&#xb0; C. The plates are washed with PBS/Tween and then incubated with secondary reagent, e.g., for human antibodies, or antibodies otherwise having a human heavy chain constant region, a goat-anti-human IgG Fc-specific polyclonal reagent conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 1 hour at 37&#xb0; C. After washing, the plates are developed with ABTS substrate (Moss Inc, product: ABTS-1000) and analyzed by a spectrophotometer at OD 415-495. Sera from immunized mice are then further screened by flow cytometry for binding to a cell line expressing human TIGIT, but not to a control cell line that does not express TIGIT. Briefly, the binding of anti-TIGIT antibodies is assessed by incubating TIGIT expressing CHO cells with the anti-TIGIT antibody at 1:20 dilution. The cells are washed and binding is detected with a PE-labeled anti-human IgG Ab. Flow cytometric analyses are performed using a FACScan flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif.). Preferably, mice that develop the highest titers will be used for fusions. Analogous experiments may be performed using anti-mouse detection antibodies if mouse anti-huTIGIT antibodies are to be detected.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0238">An ELISA assay as described above can be used to screen for antibodies and, thus, hybridomas that produce antibodies that show positive reactivity with the TIGIT immunogen. Hybridomas that produce antibodies that bind, preferably with high affinity, to TIGIT can then be subcloned and further characterized. One clone from each hybridoma, which retains the reactivity of the parent cells (by ELISA), can then be chosen for making a cell bank, and for antibody purification.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0239">To purify anti-TIGIT antibodies, selected hybridomas can be grown in two-liter spinner-flasks for monoclonal antibody purification. Supernatants can be filtered and concentrated before affinity chromatography with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.). Eluted IgG can be checked by gel electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography to ensure purity.

The monoclonal antibodies can be aliquoted and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0240">To determine if the selected anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibodies bind to unique epitopes, each antibody can be biotinylated using commercially available reagents (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). Biotinylated MAb binding can be detected with a streptavidin labeled probe. Competition studies using unlabeled monoclonal antibodies and biotinylated monoclonal antibodies can be performed using TIGIT coated-ELISA plates as described above.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0241">To determine the isotype of purified antibodies, isotype ELISAs can be performed using reagents specific for antibodies of a particular isotype. For example, to determine the isotype of a human monoclonal antibody, wells of microtiter plates can be coated with 1 &#x3bc;g/ml of anti-human immunoglobulin overnight at 4&#xb0; C. After blocking with 1% BSA, the plates are reacted with 1 &#x3bc;g/ml or less of test monoclonal antibodies or purified isotype controls, at ambient temperature for one to two hours. The wells can then be reacted with either human IgG1 or human IgM-specific alkaline phosphatase-conjugated probes. Plates are developed and analyzed as described above.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0242">To test the binding of monoclonal antibodies to live cells expressing TIGIT, flow cytometry can be used, as described in the Examples. Briefly, cell lines expressing membrane-bound TIGIT (grown under standard growth conditions) are mixed with various concentrations of monoclonal antibodies in PBS containing 0.1% BSA at 4&#xb0; C. for 1 hour. After washing, the cells are reacted with Phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-IgG antibody under the same conditions as the primary antibody staining. The samples can be analyzed by FACScan instrument using light and side scatter properties to gate on single cells and binding of the labeled antibodies is determined. An alternative assay using fluorescence microscopy may be used (in addition to or instead of) the flow cytometry assay. Cells can be stained exactly as described above and examined by fluorescence microscopy. This method allows visualization of individual cells, but may have diminished sensitivity depending on the density of the antigen.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0243">Anti-TIGIT antibodies can be further tested for reactivity with the TIGIT antigen by Western blotting. Briefly, cell extracts from cells expressing TIGIT can be prepared and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the separated antigens will be transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 20% mouse serum, and probed with the monoclonal antibodies to be tested. IgG binding can be detected using anti-IgG alkaline phosphatase and developed with BCIP/NBT substrate tablets (Sigma Chem. Co., St. Louis, Mo.).</p><p id="p-0250" num="0244">Methods for analyzing binding affinity, cross-reactivity, and binding kinetics of various anti-TIGIT antibodies include standard assays known in the art, for example, Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) analysis, and BIACORE&#xae; surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis using a BIACORE&#xae; 2000 SPR instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden).</p><p id="p-0251" num="0245">In one embodiment, an antibody specifically binds to the extracellular region of human TIGIT. An antibody may specifically bind to a particular domain (e.g., a functional domain) within the extracellular domain of TIGIT. In a particular embodiment, the antibody specifically binds to the site on TIGIT to which PVR binds. In certain embodiments, the antibody specifically binds to the extracellular region of human TIGIT and the extracellular region of cynomolgus TIGIT. Preferably, an antibody binds to human TIGIT with high affinity.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="1">VIII. Bispecific Molecules</heading><p id="p-0252" num="0246">Antibodies described herein may be used for forming bispecific molecules. An anti-TIGIT antibody, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, can be derivatized or linked to another functional molecule, e.g., another peptide or protein (e.g., another antibody or ligand for a receptor) to generate a bispecific molecule that binds to at least two different binding sites or target molecules. The antibody described herein may in fact be derivatized or linked to more than one other functional molecule to generate multispecific molecules that bind to more than two different binding sites and/or target molecules; such multispecific molecules are also intended to be encompassed by the term &#x201c;bispecific molecule&#x201d; as used herein. To create a bispecific molecule described herein, an antibody described herein can be functionally linked (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other binding molecules, such as another antibody, antibody fragment, peptide or binding mimetic, such that a bispecific molecule results.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0247">Accordingly, provided herein are bispecific molecules comprising at least one first binding specificity for TIGIT and a second binding specificity for a second target epitope. In an embodiment described herein in which the bispecific molecule is multispecific, the molecule can further include a third binding specificity.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0248">In one embodiment, the bispecific molecules described herein comprise as a binding specificity at least one antibody, or an antibody fragment thereof, including, e.g., an Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, Fv, or a single chain Fv. The antibody may also be a light chain or heavy chain dimer, or any minimal fragment thereof such as a Fv or a single chain construct as described in Ladner et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778, the contents of which is expressly incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0249">While human monoclonal antibodies are preferred, other antibodies that can be employed in the bispecific molecules described herein are murine, chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0250">The bispecific molecules described herein can be prepared by conjugating the constituent binding specificities using methods known in the art. For example, each binding specificity of the bispecific molecule can be generated separately and then conjugated to one another. When the binding specificities are proteins or peptides, a variety of coupling or cross-linking agents can be used for covalent conjugation. Examples of cross-linking agents include protein A, carbodiimide, N-succinimidyl-S-acetyl-thioacetate (SATA), 5,5&#x2032;-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), o-phenylenedimaleimide (oPDM), N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), and sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohaxane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC) (see e.g., Karpovsky et al. (1984) <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>160:1686; Liu, M A et al. (1985) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>82:8648). Other methods include those described in Paulus (1985) Behring Ins. Mitt. No. 78, 118-132; Brennan et al. (1985) <i>Science </i>229:81-83), and Glennie et al. (1987) <i>J. Immunol. </i>139: 2367-2375). Preferred conjugating agents are SATA and sulfo-SMCC, both available from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, Ill.).</p><p id="p-0257" num="0251">When the binding specificities are antibodies, they can be conjugated via sulfhydryl bonding of the C-terminus hinge regions of the two heavy chains. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the hinge region is modified to contain an odd number of sulfhydryl residues, preferably one, prior to conjugation.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0252">Alternatively, both binding specificities can be encoded in the same vector and expressed and assembled in the same host cell. This method is particularly useful where the bispecific molecule is a mAb&#xd7;mAb, mAb&#xd7;Fab, Fab&#xd7;F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>or ligand&#xd7;Fab fusion protein. A bispecific molecule described herein can be a single chain molecule comprising one single chain antibody and a binding determinant, or a single chain bispecific molecule comprising two binding determinants. Bispecific molecules may comprise at least two single chain molecules. Methods for preparing bispecific molecules are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,203; U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,030; U.S. Pat. No. 4,881,175; U.S. Pat. No. 5,132,405; U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,513; U.S. Pat. No. 5,476,786; U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,653; U.S. Pat. No. 5,258,498; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,482,858.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0253">Binding of the bispecific molecules to their specific targets can be confirmed using art-recognized methods, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (MA), FACS analysis, bioassay (e.g., growth inhibition), or Western Blot assay. Each of these assays generally detects the presence of protein-antibody complexes of particular interest by employing a labeled reagent (e.g., an antibody) specific for the complex of interest.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">IX. Compositions</heading><p id="p-0260" num="0254">Further provided are compositions, e.g., a pharmaceutical compositions, containing anti-TIGIT antibodies, or antigen-binding fragment(s) thereof, described herein, formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may include one or a combination of (e.g., two or more different) antibodies, or immunoconjugates or bispecific molecules described herein. For example, a pharmaceutical composition described herein can comprise a combination of antibodies (or immunoconjugates or bispecifics) that bind to different epitopes on the target antigen or that have complementary activities.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0255">In certain embodiments, a composition comprises an anti-TIGIT antibody at a concentration of at least 1 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, 100 mg/ml, 150 mg/ml, 200 mg/ml, or at 1-300 mg/ml, or 100-300 mg/ml.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0256">Pharmaceutical compositions described herein also can be administered in combination therapy, i.e., combined with other agents. For example, the combination therapy can include an anti-TIGIT antibody described herein combined with at least one other anti-cancer and/or T-cell stimulating (e.g., activating) agent. Examples of therapeutic agents that can be used in combination therapy are described in greater detail below in the section on uses of the antibodies described herein.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0257">In some embodiments, therapeutic compositions disclosed herein can include other compounds, drugs, and/or agents used for the treatment of cancer. Such compounds, drugs, and/or agents can include, for example, chemotherapy drugs, small molecule drugs or antibodies that stimulate the immune response to a given cancer. In some instances, therapeutic compositions can include, for example, one or more of an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, an anti-PD-1 antibody, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, an anti-CD40 antibody, an anti-OX40 (also known as CD134, TNFRSF4, ACT35 and/or TXGP1L) antibody, an anti-LAG-3 antibody, an anti-CD73 antibody, an anti-CD137 antibody, an anti-CD27 antibody, an anti-CSF-1R antibody, a TLR agonist, or a small molecule antagonist of IDO or TGF&#x3b2;.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0258">As used herein, &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. Preferably, the carrier is suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral, spinal or epidermal administration (e.g., by injection or infusion). Depending on the route of administration, the active compound, i.e., antibody, immunoconjugate, or bispecific molecule, may be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the compound.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0259">The pharmaceutical compounds described herein may include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salts. A &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable salt&#x201d; refers to a salt that retains the desired biological activity of the parent compound and does not impart any undesired toxicological effects (see e.g., Berge, S. M., et al. (1977) <i>J. Pharm. Sci. </i>66:1-19). Examples of such salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Acid addition salts include those derived from nontoxic inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphorous and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids and the like. Base addition salts include those derived from alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic amines, such as N,N&#x2032;-dibenzylethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, procaine and the like.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0260">A pharmaceutical composition described herein also may include a pharmaceutically acceptable anti-oxidant. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0261">Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers that may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions described herein include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0262">These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of presence of microorganisms may be ensured both by sterilization procedures, supra, and by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents that delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0263">Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the pharmaceutical compositions described herein is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0264">Therapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0265">Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by sterilization microfiltration. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying (lyophilization) that yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0266">The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the subject being treated, and the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the composition that produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 0.01 percent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 0.1 percent to about 70 percent, most preferably from about 1 percent to about 30 percent of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0267">Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms described herein are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0268">For administration of the antibody, the dosage ranges from about 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 5 mg/kg, of the host body weight. For example dosages can be 0.3 mg/kg body weight, 1 mg/kg body weight, 3 mg/kg body weight, 5 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg. An exemplary treatment regime entails administration once per week, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, once every four weeks, once a month, once every 3 months or once every three to 6 months. In a preferred embodiment, anti-TIGIT antibody of the present invention is administered every two weeks. Other preferred dosage regimens for an anti-TIGIT antibody described herein include 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg body weight via intravenous administration, with the antibody being given using one of the following dosing schedules: (i) every four weeks for six dosages, then every three months; (ii) every three weeks; (iii) 3 mg/kg body weight once followed by 1 mg/kg body weight every three weeks.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0269">In some methods, two or more monoclonal antibodies with different binding specificities are administered simultaneously, in which case the dosage of each antibody administered falls within the ranges indicated. A therapeutic antibody is usually administered on multiple occasions. Intervals between single dosages can be, for example, weekly, monthly, every three months or yearly. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring blood levels of antibody to the target antigen in the patient. In some methods, dosage is adjusted to achieve a plasma antibody concentration of about 1-1000 &#x3bc;g/ml and in some methods about 25-300 &#x3bc;g/ml.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0270">An antibody can be administered as a sustained release formulation, in which case less frequent administration is required. Dosage and frequency vary depending on the half-life of the antibody in the patient. In general, human antibodies show the longest half-life, followed by humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, and nonhuman antibodies. The dosage and frequency of administration can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. In prophylactic applications, a relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent intervals over a long period of time. Some patients continue to receive treatment for the rest of their lives. In therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated, and preferably until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patient can optionally be administered a prophylactic regime, although in many immune-oncology indications continued treatment is not necessary.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0271">Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient that is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions described herein employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0272">A &#x201c;therapeutically effective dosage&#x201d; of an anti-TIGIT antibody described herein preferably results in a decrease in severity of disease symptoms, an increase in frequency and duration of disease symptom-free periods, or a prevention of impairment or disability due to the disease affliction. In the context of cancer, a therapeutically effective dose preferably prevents further deterioration of physical symptoms associated with cancer. Symptoms of cancer are well-known in the art and include, for example, unusual mole features, a change in the appearance of a mole, including asymmetry, border, color and/or diameter, a newly pigmented skin area, an abnormal mole, darkened area under nail, breast lumps, nipple changes, breast cysts, breast pain, death, weight loss, weakness, excessive fatigue, difficulty eating, loss of appetite, chronic cough, worsening breathlessness, coughing up blood, blood in the urine, blood in stool, nausea, vomiting, liver metastases, lung metastases, bone metastases, abdominal fullness, bloating, fluid in peritoneal cavity, vaginal bleeding, constipation, abdominal distension, perforation of colon, acute peritonitis (infection, fever, pain), pain, vomiting blood, heavy sweating, fever, high blood pressure, anemia, diarrhea, jaundice, dizziness, chills, muscle spasms, colon metastases, lung metastases, bladder metastases, liver metastases, bone metastases, kidney metastases, and pancreatic metastases, difficulty swallowing, and the like. Therapeutic efficacy may be observable immediately after the first administration of an anti-huTIGIT mAb of the present invention, or it may only be observed after a period of time and/or a series of doses. Such delayed efficacy my only be observed after several months of treatment, up to 6, 9 or 12 months. It is critical not to decide prematurely that an anti-huTIGIT mAb of the present invention lacks therapeutically efficacy in light of the delayed efficacy exhibited by some immune-oncology agents.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0273">A therapeutically effective dose may prevent or delay onset of cancer, such as may be desired when early or preliminary signs of the disease are present. Laboratory tests utilized in the diagnosis of cancer include chemistries (including the measurement of TIGIT levels), hematology, serology and radiology. Accordingly, any clinical or biochemical assay that monitors any of the foregoing may be used to determine whether a particular treatment is a therapeutically effective dose for treating cancer. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to determine such amounts based on such factors as the subject's size, the severity of the subject's symptoms, and the particular composition or route of administration selected.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0274">A composition described herein can be administered via one or more routes of administration using one or more of a variety of methods known in the art. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. Preferred routes of administration for antibodies described herein include intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, spinal or other parenteral routes of administration, for example by injection or infusion. The phrase &#x201c;parenteral administration&#x201d; as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal injection and infusion.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0275">Alternatively, an antibody described herein can be administered via a non-parenteral route, such as a topical, epidermal or mucosal route of administration, for example, intranasally, orally, vaginally, rectally, sublingually or topically.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0276">The active compounds can be prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., <i>Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems</i>, J. R.

In a particular embodiment, the methods are particularly suitable for treatment of cancer in vivo. To achieve antigen-specific enhancement of immunity, anti-TIGIT antibodies described herein can be administered together with an antigen of interest or the antigen may already be present in the subject to be treated (e.g., a tumor-bearing or virus-bearing subject). When antibodies to TIGIT are administered together with another agent, the two can be administered separately or simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0281">Also encompassed are methods for detecting the presence of human TIGIT antigen in a sample, or measuring the amount of human TIGIT antigen, comprising contacting the sample, and a control sample, with a human monoclonal antibody, or an antigen binding fragment thereof, which specifically binds to human TIGIT, under conditions that allow for formation of a complex between the antibody or fragment thereof and human TIGIT. The formation of a complex is then detected, wherein a difference in complex formation between the sample compared to the control sample is indicative the presence of human TIGIT antigen in the sample. Moreover, the anti-TIGIT antibodies described herein can be used to purify human TIGIT via immunoaffinity purification.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0282">Given the ability of anti-TIGIT antibodies described herein to block inhibition or co-inhibition of T cell responses, e.g., antigen-specific T cell responses, provided herein are in vitro and in vivo methods of using the antibodies described herein to stimulate, enhance or upregulate antigen-specific T cell responses, e.g., anti-tumor T cell responses. In certain embodiments, CD3 stimulation is also provided (e.g., by coincubation with a cell expressing membrane CD3), which stimulation can be provided at the same time, before, or after treatment with an anti-TIGIT antibody. For example, provided herein are methods of enhancing an antigen-specific T cell response comprising contacting said T cell with an anti-TIGIT antibody described herein, and optionally with CD3, such that an antigen-specific T cell response is enhanced, e.g. by removal of a TIGIT-mediated inhibitory effect.

Also provided are methods of treating chronic viral infection in a subject comprising administering to the subject an anti-TIGIT antibody described herein such that the chronic viral infection is treated in the subject.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0285">Also encompassed herein are methods for depleting T<sub>reg </sub>cells from the tumor microenvironment of a subject having a tumor, e.g., cancerous tumor, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-TIGIT antibody described herein that comprises an Fc that stimulates depletion of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in the tumor microenvironment. An Fc may, e.g., be an Fc with effector function or enhanced effector function, such as binding or having enhanced binding to one or more activating Fc receptors. In a preferred embodiment, T<sub>reg </sub>depletion occurs without significant depletion or inhibition of T<sub>eff </sub>in the tumor microenvironment, and without significant depletion or inhibition of T<sub>eff </sub>cells and T<sub>reg </sub>cells outside of the tumor microenvironment. In certain embodiments, the subject has higher levels of TIGIT on T<sub>reg </sub>cells than on T<sub>eff </sub>cells, e.g., in the tumor microenvironment. In certain embodiments, anti-TIGIT antibodies may deplete Tregs in tumors and/or Tregs in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). For example, in the CT26 tumor model, an anti-mouse TIGIT antibody formatted as a mouse IgG2a (which exhibits effector function) partially depleted both T<sub>reg </sub>and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but did not deplete CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. An effectorless counterpart anti-TIGIT antibody, formatted as a mouse IgG1 D265A, did not deplete T cells. When considering whether or not to use an having effector function or an effectorless anti-TIGIT antibody due consideration must be paid to the tradeoff between depletion of T<sub>reg</sub>s, which may enhance anti-tumor immune response, and depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which would eliminate some of the cells needed to actually kill tumor cells. Although depletion of T<sub>reg</sub>s might be expected to enhance anti-tumor activity, recent studies have demonstrated that ligation of TIGIT on TIGIT<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub>s promotes T<sub>reg </sub>cell-mediated suppression of T<sub>eff </sub>cell proliferation (Joller et al. (2014) <i>Immunity </i>40:569), suggesting that blocking of TIGIT signaling (e.g. using an antagonist anti-TIGIT antibody of the present invention) might also enhance anti-tumor activity. Accordingly, it may be most efficacious to use an antagonist anti-TIGIT antibody lacking effector function, which i) blocks TIGIT signaling in T<sub>reg</sub>s thus reducing their immunesuppresive activity, ii) activates anti-tumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by blocking TIGIT's inhibitory effects, while at the same time avoiding their effector-function-mediated depletion, and iii) enhances DNAM-mediated activation by allowing DNAM to bind to PVR that would otherwise have been bound by TIGIT (and by reducing direct TIGIT-DNAM interactions) (Johnston et al. (2014) <i>Cancer Cell </i>26:923).</p><p id="p-0292" num="0286">In certain embodiments, an anti-TIGIT antibody is given to a subject as an adjunctive therapy.

(2004) <i>J. Immunol. </i>173:4919-28). Non-limiting examples of tumor vaccines that can be used include peptides of melanoma antigens, such as peptides of gp100, MAGE antigens, Trp-2, MARTI and/or tyrosinase, or tumor cells transfected to express the cytokine GM-CSF.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0292">Many experimental strategies for vaccination against tumors have been devised (see Rosenberg, S., 2000, Development of Cancer Vaccines, ASCO Educational Book Spring: 60-62; Logothetis, C., 2000, ASCO Educational Book Spring: 300-302; Khayat, D. 2000, ASCO Educational Book Spring: 414-428; Foon, K. 2000, ASCO Educational Book Spring: 730-738; see also Restifo, N. and Sznol, M., Cancer Vaccines, Ch. 61, pp. 3023-3043 in DeVita et al. (eds.), 1997, Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology, Fifth Edition). In one of these strategies, a vaccine is prepared using autologous or allogeneic tumor cells. These cellular vaccines have been shown to be most effective when the tumor cells are transduced to express GM-CSF. GM-CSF has been shown to be a potent activator of antigen presentation for tumor vaccination (Dranoff et al. (1993) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </i>90: 3539-43).</p><p id="p-0299" num="0293">The study of gene expression and large scale gene expression patterns in various tumors has led to the definition of so called tumor specific antigens (Rosenberg, S A (1999) <i>Immunity </i>10: 281-7). In many cases, these tumor specific antigens are differentiation antigens expressed in the tumors and in the cell from which the tumor arose, for example melanocyte antigens gp100, MAGE antigens, and Trp-2. More importantly, many of these antigens can be shown to be the targets of tumor specific T cells found in the host. TIGIT inhibition can be used in conjunction with a collection of recombinant proteins and/or peptides expressed in a tumor in order to generate an immune response to these proteins. These proteins are normally viewed by the immune system as self antigens and are therefore tolerant to them. The tumor antigen can include the protein telomerase, which is required for the synthesis of telomeres of chromosomes and which is expressed in more than 85% of human cancers and in only a limited number of somatic tissues (Kim et al. (1994) <i>Science</i>266: 2011-2013). Tumor antigen can also be &#x201c;neo-antigens&#x201d; expressed in cancer cells because of somatic mutations that alter protein sequence or create fusion proteins between two unrelated sequences (i.e., bcr-abl in the Philadelphia chromosome), or idiotype from B cell tumors.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0294">Other tumor vaccines can include the proteins from viruses implicated in human cancers such a Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV), Hepatitis Viruses (HBV and HCV) and Kaposi's Herpes Sarcoma Virus (KHSV). Another form of tumor specific antigen that can be used in conjunction with TIGIT inhibition is purified heat shock proteins (HSP) isolated from the tumor tissue itself. These heat shock proteins contain fragments of proteins from the tumor cells and these HSPs are highly efficient at delivery to antigen presenting cells for eliciting tumor immunity (Suot &#x26; Srivastava (1995) <i>Science </i>269:1585-1588; Tamura et al. (1997) <i>Science </i>278:117-120).</p><p id="p-0301" num="0295">Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen presenting cells that can be used to prime antigen-specific responses. DC's can be produced ex vivo and loaded with various protein and peptide antigens as well as tumor cell extracts (Nestle et al. (1998) <i>Nature Medicine </i>4: 328-332). DCs can also be transduced by genetic means to express these tumor antigens as well. DCs have also been fused directly to tumor cells for the purposes of immunization (Kugler et al. (2000) <i>Nature Medicine </i>6:332-336). As a method of vaccination, DC immunization can be effectively combined with TIGIT blocking to activate (unleash) more potent anti-tumor responses.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0296">TIGIT inhibition can also be combined with standard cancer treatments (e.g., surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy). TIGIT inhibition can be effectively combined with chemotherapeutic regimes. In these instances, it may be possible to reduce the dose of chemotherapeutic reagent administered (Mokyr et al. (1998) <i>Cancer Research </i>58: 5301-5304). An example of such a combination is an anti-TIGIT antibody in combination with decarbazine for the treatment of melanoma. Another example of such a combination is an anti-TIGIT antibody in combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2) for the treatment of melanoma. The scientific rationale behind the combined use of TIGIT inhibition and chemotherapy is that cell death, that is a consequence of the cytotoxic action of most chemotherapeutic compounds, should result in increased levels of tumor antigen in the antigen presentation pathway. Other combination therapies that may result in synergy with TIGIT inhibition through cell death are radiation, surgery, and hormone deprivation. Each of these protocols creates a source of tumor antigen in the host. Angiogenesis inhibitors can also be combined with TIGIT inhibition. Inhibition of angiogenesis leads to tumor cell death, which may feed tumor antigen into host antigen presentation pathways.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0297">The anti-TIGIT antibodies described herein can also be used in combination with bispecific antibodies that target Fc&#x3b1; or Fc&#x3b3; receptor-expressing effectors cells to tumor cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,922,845 and 5,837,243). Bispecific antibodies can be used to target two separate antigens. For example anti-Fc receptor/anti tumor antigen (e.g., Her-2/neu) bispecific antibodies have been used to target macrophages to sites of tumor. This targeting may more effectively activate tumor specific responses. The T cell arm of these responses would be augmented by the inhibition of TIGIT. Alternatively, antigen may be delivered directly to DCs by the use of bispecific antibodies that bind to tumor antigen and a dendritic cell specific cell surface marker.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0298">Tumors evade host immune surveillance by a large variety of mechanisms. Many of these mechanisms may be overcome by the inactivation of immunosuppressive proteins expressed by the tumors. These include among others TGF-&#x3b2; (Kehrl et al. (1986) <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>163: 1037-1050), IL-10 (Howard &#x26; O'Garra (1992) <i>Immunology Today </i>13: 198-200), and Fas ligand (Hahne et al. (1996) <i>Science </i>274: 1363-1365). Antibodies to each of these entities can be used in combination with anti-TIGIT antibodies to counteract the effects of the immunosuppressive agent and favor tumor immune responses by the host.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0299">Other antibodies that activate host immune responsiveness can be used in combination with anti-TIGIT antibodies. These include molecules on the surface of dendritic cells that activate DC function and antigen presentation. Anti-CD40 antibodies are able to substitute effectively for T cell helper activity (Ridge et al. (1998) Nature 393: 474-478) and can be used in conjunction with anti-TIGIT antibodies. Activating antibodies to T cell costimulatory molecules such as OX-40 (Weinberg et al. (2000) <i>Immunol </i>164: 2160-2169), CD137/4-1BB (Melero et al. (1997) <i>Nature Medicine </i>3: 682-685 (1997), and ICOS (Hutloff et al. (1999) <i>Nature </i>397: 262-266) may also provide for increased levels of T cell activation. Inhibitors of PD-1 or PD-L1, or CTLA-4 (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,097), may also be used in conjunction with anti-TIGIT antibodies.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0300">Bone marrow transplantation is currently being used to treat a variety of tumors of hematopoietic origin. While graft versus host disease is a consequence of this treatment, therapeutic benefit may be obtained from graft vs. tumor responses. TIGIT inhibition can be used to increase the effectiveness of the donor engrafted tumor specific T cells.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0301">There are also several experimental treatment protocols that involve ex vivo activation and expansion of antigen specific T cells and adoptive transfer of these cells into recipients in order to stimulate antigen-specific T cells against tumor (Greenberg &#x26; Riddell (1999) <i>Science </i>285: 546-51). These methods can also be used to activate T cell responses to infectious agents such as CMV. Ex vivo activation in the presence of anti-TIGIT antibodies can increase the frequency and activity of the adoptively transferred T cells.</p><heading id="h-0030" level="2">Chronic Viral Infections</heading><p id="p-0308" num="0302">In another aspect, the invention described herein provides a method of treating an infectious disease in a subject comprising administering to the subject an anti-TIGIT antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, such that the subject is treated for the infectious disease.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0303">Similar to its application to tumors as discussed above, antibody-mediated TIGIT inhibition can be used alone, or as an adjuvant, in combination with vaccines, to enhance the immune response to pathogens, toxins, and self-antigens.

For example, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody and an anti-TIGIT antibody can be administered sequentially, such as anti-CTLA-4 antibody being administered first and anti-TIGIT antibody second, or anti-TIGIT antibody being administered first and anti-CTLA-4 antibody second. Additionally or alternatively, an anti-PD-1 antibody and an anti-TIGIT antibody can be administered sequentially, such as anti-PD-1 antibody being administered first and anti-TIGIT antibody second, or anti-TIGIT antibody being administered first and anti-PD-1 antibody second. Additionally or alternatively, an anti-PD-L1 antibody and an anti-TIGIT antibody can be administered sequentially, such as anti-PD-L1 antibody being administered first and anti-TIGIT antibody second, or anti-TIGIT antibody being administered first and anti-PD-L1 antibody second.

For example, the first administration of a combination anti-CTLA-4 antibody and anti-TIGIT antibody can be concurrent, the second administration can be sequential with anti-CTLA-4 antibody first and anti-TIGIT antibody second, and the third administration can be sequential with anti-TIGIT antibody first and anti-CTLA-4 antibody second, etc. Additionally or alternatively, the first administration of a combination anti-PD-1 antibody and anti-TIGIT antibody can be concurrent, the second administration can be sequential with anti-PD-1 antibody first and anti-TIGIT antibody second, and the third administration can be sequential with anti-TIGIT antibody first and anti-PD-1 antibody second, etc. Additionally or alternatively, the first administration of a combination anti-PD-L1 antibody and anti-TIGIT antibody can be concurrent, the second administration can be sequential with anti-PD-L1 antibody first and anti-TIGIT antibody second, and the third administration can be sequential with anti-TIGIT antibody first and anti-PD-L1 antibody second, etc. Additionally or alternatively, the first administration of a combination anti-LAG-3 antibody and anti-TIGIT antibody can be concurrent, the second administration can be sequential with anti-LAG-3 antibody first and anti-TIGIT antibody second, and the third administration can be sequential with anti-TIGIT antibody first and anti-LAG-3 antibody second, etc. Another representative dosing scheme can involve a first administration that is sequential with anti-TIGIT first and anti-CTLA-4 antibody (and/or anti-PD-1 antibody and/or anti-PD-L1 antibody and/or anti-LAG-3 antibody) second, and subsequent administrations may be concurrent.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0340">Optionally, an anti-TIGIT as sole immunotherapeutic agent, or the combination of an anti-TIGIT antibody and one or more additional immunotherapeutic antibodies (e.g., anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 and/or anti-LAG-3 blockade) can be further combined with an immunogenic agent, such as cancerous cells, purified tumor antigens (including recombinant proteins, peptides, and carbohydrate molecules), cells, and cells transfected with genes encoding immune stimulating cytokines (He et al. (2004) <i>J. Immunol. </i>173:4919-28). Non-limiting examples of tumor vaccines that can be used include peptides of melanoma antigens, such as peptides of gp100, MAGE antigens, Trp-2, MART1 and/or tyrosinase, or tumor cells transfected to express the cytokine GM-CSF (discussed further below). A TIGIT inhibitor and one or more additional antibodies (e.g., CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 and/or PD-L1 and/or LAG-3 blockade) can also be further combined with standard cancer treatments. For example, a TIGIT inhibitor and one or more additional antibodies (e.g., CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 and/or PD-L1 and/or LAG-3 blockade) can be effectively combined with chemotherapeutic regimes. In these instances, it is possible to reduce the dose of other chemotherapeutic reagent administered with the combination of the instant disclosure (Mokyr et al. (1998) <i>Cancer Research </i>58: 5301-5304). An example of such a combination is a combination of anti-TIGIT agonist antibody with or without and an additional antibody, such as anti-CTLA-4 antibodies and/or anti-PD-1 antibodies and/or anti-PD-L1 antibodies and/or anti-LAG-3 antibodies) further in combination with decarbazine for the treatment of melanoma. Another example is a combination of anti-TIGIT antibody with or without and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies and/or anti-PD-1 antibodies and/or anti-PD-L1 antibodies and/or LAG-3 antibodies further in combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2) for the treatment of melanoma. The scientific rationale behind the combined use of TIGIT inhibition and CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 and/or PD-L1 and/or LAG-3 blockade with chemotherapy is that cell death, which is a consequence of the cytotoxic action of most chemotherapeutic compounds, should result in increased levels of tumor antigen in the antigen presentation pathway. Other combination therapies that may result in synergy with a combined TIGIT inhibition with or without and CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 and/or PD-L1 and/or LAG-3 blockade through cell death include radiation, surgery, or hormone deprivation. Each of these protocols creates a source of tumor antigen in the host. Angiogenesis inhibitors can also be combined with a combined TIGIT inhibition and CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 and/or PD-L1 and/or LAG-3 blockade. Inhibition of angiogenesis leads to tumor cell death, which can be a source of tumor antigen fed into host antigen presentation pathways.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0341">An anti-TIGIT antagonist antibody as sole immunotherapeutic agent, or a combination of TIGIT antagonistic and CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 and/or PD-L1 and/or LAG-3 blocking antibodies can also be used in combination with bispecific antibodies that target Fc&#x3b1; or Fc&#x3b3; receptor-expressing effector cells to tumor cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,922,845 and 5,837,243). Bispecific antibodies can be used to target two separate antigens. The T cell arm of these responses would be augmented by the use of a combined TIGIT inhibition and CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 and/or PD-L1 and/or LAG-3 blockade.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0342">In another example, an anti-TIGIT antagonist antibody as sole immunotherapeutic agent or a combination of an anti-TIGIT antibody and additional immunostimulating agent, e.g., anti-CTLA-4 antibody and/or anti-PD-1 antibody and/or anti-PD-L1 antibody and/or LAG-3 agent, e.g., antibody, can be used in conjunction with an anti-neoplastic antibody, such as RITUXAN&#xae; (rituximab), HERCEPTIN&#xae; (trastuzumab), BEXXAR&#xae; (tositumomab), ZEVALIN&#xae; (ibritumomab), CAMPATH&#xae; (alemtuzumab), LYMPHOCIDE&#xae; (eprtuzumab), AVASTIN&#xae; (bevacizumab), and TARCEVA&#xae; (erlotinib), and the like. By way of example and not wishing to be bound by theory, treatment with an anti-cancer antibody or an anti-cancer antibody conjugated to a toxin can lead to scancer cell death (e.g., tumor cells) which would potentiate an immune response mediated by the immunostimulating agent, e.g., TIGIT, CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1 or LAG-3 agent, e.g., antibody. In an exemplary embodiment, a treatment of a hyperproliferative disease (e.g., a cancer tumor) can include an anti-cancer agent, e.g., antibody, in combination with anti-TIGIT and optionally an additional immunostimulating agent, e.g., anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 and/or anti-LAG-3 agent, e.g., antibody, concurrently or sequentially or any combination thereof, which can potentiate an anti-tumor immune responses by the host.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0343">Tumors evade host immune surveillance by a large variety of mechanisms. Many of these mechanisms may be overcome by the inactivation of proteins, which are expressed by the tumors and which are immunosuppressive. These include, among others, TGF-&#x3b2; (Kehrl et al. (1986) <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>163: 1037-1050), IL-10 (Howard &#x26; O'Garra (1992) <i>Immunology Today </i>13: 198-200), and Fas ligand (Hahne et al. (1996) <i>Science </i>274: 1363-1365). Antibodies to each of these entities can be further combined with an anti-TIGIT antibody with or without an additional immunostimulating agent, e.g., an anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 and/or anti-LAG-3 agent, such as antibody, to counteract the effects of immunosuppressive agents and favor anti-tumor immune responses by the host.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0344">Other agents, e.g., antibodies, that can be used to activate host immune responsiveness can be further used in combination with an anti-TIGIT antibody with or without an additional immunostimulating agent, such as anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 and/or anti-LAG-3 antibody. These include molecules on the surface of dendritic cells that activate DC function and antigen presentation. Anti-CD40 antibodies (Ridge et al., supra) can be used in conjunction with an anti-TIGIT antibody and optionally an additional immunostimulating agent, e.g., an anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 and/or anti-LAG-3 agent, e.g., antibody. Other activating antibodies to T cell co-stimulatory molecules OX-40 (Weinberg et al. (2000) <i>Immunol </i>164:2160-2169), CD137/4-1BB (Melero et al. (1997) <i>Nature Medicine </i>3:682-685 (1997), and ICOS (Hutloff et al. (1999) <i>Nature </i>397:262-266) may also provide for increased levels of T cell activation.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0345">As discussed above, bone marrow transplantation is currently being used to treat a variety of tumors of hematopoietic origin. Anti-TIGIT immunotherapy alone or combined with CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 and/or PD-L1 and/or LAG-3 blockade can be used to increase the effectiveness of the donor engrafted tumor specific T cells.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0346">Several experimental treatment protocols involve ex vivo activation and expansion of antigen specific T cells and adoptive transfer of these cells into recipients in order to antigen-specific T cells against tumor (Greenberg &#x26; Riddell, supra). These methods can also be used to activate T cell responses to infectious agents such as CMV. Ex vivo activation in the presence of anti-TIGIT with or without an additional immunostimulating therapy, e.g., anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 and/or anti-LAG-3 antibodies can be expected to increase the frequency and activity of the adoptively transferred T cells.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0347">Provided herein are methods for altering an adverse event associated with treatment of a hyperproliferative disease (e.g., cancer) with an immunostimulatory agent, comprising administering an anti-TIGIT antibody with or without and a subtherapeutic dose of anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 and/or anti-LAG-3 agent, e.g., antibody, to a subject. For example, the methods described herein provide for a method of reducing the incidence of immunostimulatory therapeutic antibody-induced colitis or diarrhea by administering a non-absorbable steroid to the patient. As used herein, a &#x201c;non-absorbable steroid&#x201d; is a glucocorticoid that exhibits extensive first pass metabolism such that, following metabolism in the liver, the bioavailability of the steroid is low, i.e., less than about 20%. In one embodiment described herein, the non-absorbable steroid is budesonide. Budesonide is a locally-acting glucocorticosteroid, which is extensively metabolized, primarily by the liver, following oral administration. ENTOCORT EC&#xae; (Astra-Zeneca) is a pH- and time-dependent oral formulation of budesonide developed to optimize drug delivery to the ileum and throughout the colon. ENTOCORT EC&#xae; is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of mild to moderate Crohn's disease involving the ileum and/or ascending colon. The usual oral dosage of ENTOCORT EC&#xae; for the treatment of Crohn's disease is 6 to 9 mg/day. ENTOCORT EC&#xae; is released in the intestines before being absorbed and retained in the gut mucosa. Once it passes through the gut mucosa target tissue, ENTOCORT EC&#xae; is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system in the liver to metabolites with negligible glucocorticoid activity. Therefore, the bioavailability is low (about 10%). The low bioavailability of budesonide results in an improved therapeutic ratio compared to other glucocorticoids with less extensive first-pass metabolism. Budesonide results in fewer adverse effects, including less hypothalamic-pituitary suppression, than systemically-acting corticosteroids. However, chronic administration of ENTOCORT EC&#xae; can result in systemic glucocorticoid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression.

Salicylates include 5-ASA agents such as, for example: sulfasalazine (AZULFIDINE&#xae;, Pharmacia &#x26; UpJohn); olsalazine (DIPENTUM&#xae;, Pharmacia &#x26; UpJohn); balsalazide (COLAZAL&#xae;, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.); and mesalamine (ASACOL&#xae;, Procter &#x26; Gamble Pharmaceuticals; PENTASA&#xae;, Shire US; CANASA&#xae;, Axcan Scandipharm, Inc.; ROWASA&#xae;, Solvay).</p><p id="p-0356" num="0349">In accordance with the methods described herein, a salicylate administered in combination with anti-TIGIT with or without anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 and/or LAG-3 antibodies and a non-absorbable steroid can includes any overlapping or sequential administration of the salicylate and the non-absorbable steroid for the purpose of decreasing the incidence of colitis induced by the immunostimulatory antibodies. Thus, for example, methods for reducing the incidence of colitis induced by the immunostimulatory antibodies described herein encompass administering a salicylate and a non-absorbable concurrently or sequentially (e.g., a salicylate is administered 6 hours after a non-absorbable steroid), or any combination thereof. Further, a salicylate and a non-absorbable steroid can be administered by the same route (e.g., both are administered orally) or by different routes (e.g., a salicylate is administered orally and a non-absorbable steroid is administered rectally), which may differ from the route(s) used to administer the anti-TIGIT and anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 and/or anti-LAG-3 antibodies.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0350">The anti-TIGIT antibodies and combination antibody therapies described herein may also be used in conjunction with other well-known therapies that are selected for their particular usefulness against the indication being treated (e.g., cancer).

In the first half of the concentration series, 40 nM (2&#xd7;) TIGIT antigen (rhTIGIT/Fc) was added to make the final concentration series (60 &#x3bc;g/ml-0.0 &#x3bc;g/ml) and 20 nM of final antigen concentration in each well. In the second half of the concentration series, in place of antigen, buffer was added to have the antibody diluted to the same concentration, and this half was treated as the blank. Complexes of the second anti-TIGIT antibodies and rhTIGIT/Fc were incubated for 2 hours. 40 &#x3bc;L complexes were injected on the antibody (first) coated surface at a 30 &#x3bc;L/min flow rate. A BIACORE&#xae; T200 surface plasmon resonance instrument was used and the running buffer was HBE-EP, GE Healthcare CAT# BR-1001-88, filtered degassed, 0.01M HEPES, pH7.4, 0.15 NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20. The surface was regenerated with 25 mM NaOH (Order code: BR-1003-58, GE Healthcare) at 100 &#x3bc;L/min for 5 seconds.
