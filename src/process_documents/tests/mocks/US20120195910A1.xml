PCSK9 plays a critical role in cholesterol metabolism by controlling the levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles that circulate in the bloodstream. Elevated levels of PCSK9 have been shown to reduce LDL-receptor levels in the liver, resulting in high levels of LDL-cholesterol in the plasma and increased susceptibility to coronary artery disease. (Peterson et al., <i>J Lipid Res. </i>49(7):1595-9 (2008)). Therefore, it would be highly advantageous to produce a therapeutic-based antagonist of PCSK9 that inhibits or antagonizes the activity of PCSK9 and the corresponding role PCSK9 plays in various therapeutic conditions.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention is in part based on a variety of antibodies to PCSK9. PCSK9 presents as an important and advantageous therapeutic target, and the invention provides antibodies as therapeutic and diagnostic agents for use in targeting pathological conditions associated with expression and/or activity of PCSK9.

It is to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. In the event that any definition set forth below conflicts with any document incorporated herein by reference, the definition set forth below shall control.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Throughout the present specification and claims, the numbering of the residues in an immunoglobulin heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991), expressly incorporated herein by reference. The &#x201c;EU index as in Kabat&#x201d; refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG<sub>1 </sub>EU antibody.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">An &#x201c;acceptor human framework&#x201d; for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a light chain variable domain (VL) framework or a heavy chain variable domain (VH) framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework, as defined below. An acceptor human framework &#x201c;derived from&#x201d; a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain amino acid sequence changes. In some embodiments, the number of amino acid changes are 10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less. In some embodiments, the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">&#x201c;Affinity&#x201d; refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, &#x201c;binding affinity&#x201d; refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity are described in the following.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">An &#x201c;affinity matured&#x201d; antibody refers to an antibody with one or more alterations in one or more hypervariable regions (HVRs), compared to a parent antibody which does not possess such alterations, such alterations resulting in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The terms &#x201c;anti-PCSK9 antibody&#x201d;, &#x201c;anti-PCSK9&#x201d;, &#x201c;PCSK9 antibody&#x201d; or &#x201c;an antibody that binds to PCSK9&#x201d; refers to an antibody that is capable of binding PCSK9 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent in targeting PCSK9. In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an anti-PCSK9 antibody to an unrelated, non-PCSK9 protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to PCSK9 as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to PCSK9 has a dissociation constant (Kd) of &#x2266;1 &#x3bc;M, &#x2266;100 nM, &#x2266;10 nM, &#x2266;1 nM, &#x2266;0.1 nM, &#x2266;0.01 nM, or &#x2266;0.001 nM (e.g. 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>M or less, e.g. from 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>M to 10<sup>&#x2212;13</sup>M, e.g., from 10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>M to 10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>M). In certain embodiments, an anti-PCSK9 antibody binds to an epitope of PCSK9 that is conserved among PCSK9 from different species.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; herein is used in the broadest sense and encompasses various antibody structures, including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired antigen-binding activity.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">An &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; refers to a molecule other than an intact antibody that comprises a portion of an intact antibody that binds the antigen to which the intact antibody binds. Examples of antibody fragments include but are not limited to Fv, Fab, Fab&#x2032;, Fab&#x2032;-SH, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules (e.g. scFv); and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called &#x201c;Fab&#x201d; fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual &#x201c;Fc&#x201d; fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">An &#x201c;antibody that binds to the same epitope&#x201d; as a reference antibody refers to an antibody that blocks binding of the reference antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50% or more, and conversely, the reference antibody blocks binding of the antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50% or more.

The FR of a variable domain generally consists of four FR domains: FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4. Accordingly, the HVRand FR sequences generally appear in the following sequence in VH (or VL): FR1-H1(L1)-FR2-H2(L2)-FR3-H3 (L3)-FR4.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The terms &#x201c;full length antibody,&#x201d; &#x201c;intact antibody,&#x201d; and &#x201c;whole antibody&#x201d; are used herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody having a structure substantially similar to a native antibody structure or having heavy chains that contain an Fc region as defined herein.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">&#x201c;Fv&#x201d; is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-binding site. In one embodiment, a two-chain Fv species consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv (scFv) species, one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a &#x201c;dimeric&#x201d; structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three HVRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six HVRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The terms &#x201c;host cell,&#x201d; &#x201c;host cell line,&#x201d; and &#x201c;host cell culture&#x201d; are used interchangeably and refer to cells into which exogenous nucleic acid has been introduced, including the progeny of such cells. Host cells include &#x201c;transformants&#x201d; and &#x201c;transformed cells,&#x201d; which include the primary transformed cell and progeny derived therefrom without regard to the number of passages.

Generally, native four-chain antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the VH(H1, H2, H3), and three in the VL (L1, L2, L3). HVRs generally comprise amino acid residues from the hypervariable loops and/or from the &#x201c;complementarity determining regions&#x201d; (CDRs), the latter being of highest sequence variability and/or involved in antigen recognition.

Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (<sup>125</sup>I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g., Chen et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>293:865-881 (1999)). To establish conditions for the assay, MICROTITER&#xae; multi-well plates (Thermo Scientific) are coated overnight with 5 &#x3bc;g/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23&#xb0; C.). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [<sup>125</sup>I]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., <i>Cancer Res. </i>57:4593-4599 (1997)). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20) in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 &#x3bc;l/well of scintillant (MICROSCINT-20&#x2122;; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT&#x2122; gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0157">According to another embodiment, Kd is measured using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE&#xae;-2000 or a BIACORE&#xae;-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25&#xb0; C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at &#x2dc;10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIACORE, Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N&#x2032;-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 &#x3bc;g/ml (&#x2dc;0.2 &#x3bc;M) before injection at a flow rate of 5 &#x3bc;l/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20&#x2122;) surfactant (PBST) at 25&#xb0; C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 &#x3bc;l/min. Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE&#xae; Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. See, e.g., Chen et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>293:865-881 (1999). If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>5<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25&#xb0; C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO&#x2122; spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0158">2.

Such animals typically contain all or a portion of the human immunoglobulin loci, which replace the endogenous immunoglobulin loci, or which are present extrachromosomally or integrated randomly into the animal's chromosomes. In such transgenic mice, the endogenous immunoglobulin loci have generally been inactivated. For review of methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic animals, see Lonberg, <i>Nat.

For example, a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are reviewed, e.g., in Hoogenboom et al. in <i>Methods in Molecular Biology </i>178:1-37 (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., 2001) and further described, e.g., in the McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552-554; Clackson et al., <i>Nature </i>352: 624-628 (1991); Marks et al., <i>J.

Rev. Immunol., </i>12: 433-455 (1994). Phage typically display antibody fragments, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments or as Fab fragments. Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned (e.g., from human) to provide a single source of antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al., <i>EMBO J, </i>12: 725-734 (1993). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning unrearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro, as described by Hoogenboom and Winter, <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>227: 381-388 (1992). Patent publications describing human antibody phage libraries include, for example: U.S. Pat.

Multispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different sites. In certain embodiments, one of the binding specificities is for PCSK9 and the other is for any other antigen. In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of PCSK9. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express PCSK9.

Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further study will have modifications (e.g., improvements) in certain biological properties (e.g., increased affinity, reduced immunogenicity) relative to the parent antibody and/or will have substantially retained certain biological properties of the parent antibody. An exemplary substitutional variant is an affinity matured antibody, which may be conveniently generated, e.g., using phage display-based affinity maturation techniques such as those described herein. Briefly, one or more HVR residues are mutated and the variant antibodies displayed on phage and screened for a particular biological activity (e.g. binding affinity).</p><p id="p-0199" num="0195">Alterations (e.g., substitutions) may be made in HVRs, e.g., to improve antibody affinity. Such alterations may be made in HVR &#x201c;hotspots,&#x201d; i.e., residues encoded by codons that undergo mutation at high frequency during the somatic maturation process (see, e.g., Chowdhury, <i>Methods Mol. Biol. </i>207:179-196 (2008)), and/or SDRs (a-CDRs), with the resulting variant VH or VL being tested for binding affinity. Affinity maturation by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries has been described, e.g., in Hoogenboom et al. in <i>Methods in Molecular Biology </i>178:1-37 (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., (2001).) In some embodiments of affinity maturation, diversity is introduced into the variable genes chosen for maturation by any of a variety of methods (e.g., error-prone PCR, chain shuffling, or oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis). A secondary library is then created. The library is then screened to identify any antibody variants with the desired affinity. Another method to introduce diversity involves HVR-directed approaches, in which several HVR residues (e.g., 4-6 residues at a time) are randomized. HVR residues involved in antigen binding may be specifically identified, e.g., using alanine scanning mutagenesis or modeling. CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 in particular are often targeted.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0196">In certain embodiments, substitutions, insertions, or deletions may occur within one or more HVRs so long as such alterations do not substantially reduce the ability of the antibody to bind antigen. For example, conservative alterations (e.g., conservative substitutions as provided herein) that do not substantially reduce binding affinity may be made in HVRs. Such alterations may be outside of HVR &#x201c;hotspots&#x201d; or SDRs. In certain embodiments of the variant VH and VL sequences provided above, each HVR either is unaltered, or contains no more than one, two or three amino acid substitutions.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0197">A useful method for identification of residues or regions of an antibody that may be targeted for mutagenesis is called &#x201c;alanine scanning mutagenesis&#x201d; as described by Cunningham and Wells (1989) Science, 244:1081-1085. In this method, a residue or group of target residues (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) are identified and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (e.g., alanine or polyalanine) to determine whether the interaction of the antibody with antigen is affected. Further substitutions may be introduced at the amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the initial substitutions. Alternatively, or additionally, a crystal structure of an antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues may be targeted or eliminated as candidates for substitution. Variants may be screened to determine whether they contain the desired properties.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0198">Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (e.g., for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0199">b) Glycosylation Variants</p><p id="p-0204" num="0200">In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to an antibody may be conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more glycosylation sites is created or removed.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0201">Where the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. Native antibodies produced by mammalian cells typically comprise a branched, biantennary oligosaccharide that is generally attached by an N-linkage to Asn297 of the CH2 domain of the Fc region. See, e.g., Wright et al. <i>TIBTECH </i>15:26-32 (1997). The oligosaccharide may include various carbohydrates, e.g., mannose, N-acetyl glucosamine (G1cNAc), galactose, and sialic acid, as well as a fucose attached to a GlcNAc in the &#x201c;stem&#x201d; of the biantennary oligosaccharide structure. In some embodiments, modifications of the oligosaccharide in an antibody of the invention may be made in order to create antibody variants with certain improved properties.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0202">In one embodiment, antibody variants are provided having a carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached (directly or indirectly) to an Fc region. For example, the amount of fucose in such antibody may be from 1% to 80%, from 1% to 65%, from 5% to 65% or from 20% to 40%. The amount of fucose is determined by calculating the average amount of fucose within the sugar chain at Asn297, relative to the sum of all glycostructures attached to Asn 297 (e.g., complex, hybrid and high mannose structures) as measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as described in WO 2008/077546, for example. Asn297 refers to the asparagine residue located at about position 297 in the Fc region (EU numbering of Fc region residues); however, Asn297 may also be located about +3 amino acids upstream or downstream of position 297, i.e., between positions 294 and 300, due to minor sequence variations in antibodies. Such fucosylation variants may have improved ADCC function. See, e.g., US Patent Publication Nos. US 2003/0157108 (Presta, L.); US 2004/0093621 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd).

Mol. Biol. </i>336:1239-1249 (2004); Yamane-Ohnuki et al. <i>Biotech. Bioeng. </i>87: 614 (2004). Examples of cell lines capable of producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation (Ripka et al. <i>Arch. Biochem. Biophys. </i>249:533-545 (1986); US Patent Application No. US 2003/0157108 A1, Presta, L; and WO 2004/056312 A1, Adams et al., especially at Example 11), and knockout cell lines, such as alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase gene, FUT8, knockout CHO cells (see, e.g., Yamane-Ohnuki et al. <i>Biotech.

Such antibody variants may have reduced fucosylation and/or improved ADCC function. Examples of such antibody variants are described, e.g., in WO 2003/011878 (Jean-Mairet et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684 (Umana et al.); and US 2005/0123546 (Umana et al.). Antibody variants with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region are also provided. Such antibody variants may have improved CDC function. Such antibody variants are described, e.g., in WO 1997/30087 (Patel et al.); WO 1998/58964 (Raju, S.); and WO 1999/22764 (Raju, S.).</p><p id="p-0208" num="0204">c) Fc Region Variants</p><p id="p-0209" num="0205">In certain embodiments, one or more amino acid modifications may be introduced into the Fc region of an antibody provided herein, thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g. a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0206">In certain embodiments, the invention contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions (such as complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc&#x3b3;R binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc&#x3b3;RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc&#x3b3;RI, Fc&#x3b3;RII and Fc&#x3b3;RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol. </i>9:457-492 (1991). Non-limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 (see, e.g. Hellstrom, I. et al. <i>Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA </i>83:7059-7063 (1986)) and Hellstrom, I et al., <i>Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA </i>82:1499-1502 (1985); U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337 (see Bruggemann, M. et al., <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>166:1351-1361 (1987)). Alternatively, non-radioactive assays methods may be employed (see, for example, ACTI&#x2122; non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry (CellTechnology, Inc. Mountain View, Calif.; and CytoTox 96&#xae; non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. <i>Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA </i>95:652-656 (1998). Clq binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind Clq and hence lacks CDC activity. See, e.g., Clq and C3c binding ELISA in WO 2006/029879 and WO 2005/100402. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay may be performed (see, for example, Gazzano-Santoro et al., <i>J. Immunol.

Immunol. </i>137:3614-3619) solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, 1988<i>, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual</i>, Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid phase direct label RIA using 1-125 label (see, e.g., Morel et al., 1988<i>, Molec. Immunol. </i>25:7-15); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Cheung, et al., 1990<i>, Virology </i>176:546-552); and direct labeled RIA (Moldenhauer et al., 1990<i>, Scand. J. Immunol. </i>32:77-82). Typically, such an assay involves the use of purified antigen bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of these, an unlabelled test antigen binding protein and a labeled reference antigen binding protein. Competitive inhibition is measured by determining the amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test antigen binding protein. Usually the test antigen binding protein is present in excess. Antigen binding proteins identified by competition assay (competing antigen binding proteins) include antigen binding proteins binding to the same epitope as the reference antigen binding proteins and antigen binding proteins binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference antigen binding protein for steric hindrance to occur. Additional details regarding methods for determining competitive binding are provided in the examples herein. Usually, when a competing antigen binding protein is present in excess, it will inhibit (e.g., reduce) specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein to a common antigen by at least 40-45%, 45-50%, 50-55%, 55-60%, 60-65%, 65-70%, 70-75% or 75% or more.

The second antibody may be present in a hybridoma supernatant. As a control, immobilized PCSK9 is incubated in a solution comprising the first labeled antibody but not the second unlabeled antibody. After incubation under conditions permissive for binding of the first antibody to PCSK9, excess unbound antibody is removed, and the amount of label associated with immobilized PCSK9 is measured. If the amount of label associated with immobilized PCSK9 is substantially reduced in the test sample relative to the control sample, then that indicates that the second antibody is competing with the first antibody for binding to PCSK9.

Both hard and soft randomization strategies were used for affinity maturation. For hard randomization, one light chain library with selected positions of the three light chain CDRs was randomized using amino acids designed to mimic natural human antibodies and the designed DNA degeneracy was as described in Lee et al.
