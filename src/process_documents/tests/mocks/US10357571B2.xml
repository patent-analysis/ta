The present invention was made with government support under National Institutes of Health Grant Nos.

Most often the targeted epitopes are not tumor specific, but are also present in other non-diseased tissues. In the case of Cetuximab and Matuzumab, expression of EGFR in hair follicles, the intestines and kidney leads to non-tumor toxicity. Patients experience an acneaform rash, gastrointestinal toxicity and hypomagnesemia that may limit the duration of therapy. For Trastuzumab, cardiotoxicity is observed because of the role that ErbB2 plays in cardiomyocyte health. The antibody exacerbates the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines necessitating years of surveillance for development of dilated cardiomyopathy. For these antibodies and others it would be beneficial to improve tumor selectivity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to off-target effects, antibody therapies against solid tumors face other challenges. First, tumor vasculature is leaky, resulting in high interstitial pressures that any molecule entering the tumor has to overcome. Second, high affinity antibodies are needed to stay in the tumor long enough to exert their effects, but high affinity antibodies may encounter a &#x201c;binding site barrier&#x201d; where they were trapped by the peripheral antigen and never diffuse into the center of a solid tumor. This may result in underexposure of the tumor center. It would therefore be desired to develop antibodies and methods for their delivery to tumor cells that minimize effects to non-diseased tissues.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therapeutic antibodies cause side effects by binding receptors in non-target tissues. In one embodiment, a &#x201c;prodrug&#x201d; antibody design is described that ameliorates such side effects by occluding (directly or sterically), or &#x201c;masking&#x201d; antibody complement determining regions until they reach diseased tissues containing disease-associated proteinases. In one embodiment, a masked mAb may comprise a nucleotide sequence which encodes a first segment comprising a signal sequence; a second segment comprising a masking epitope sequence, wherein the masking epitope sequence contains an epitope specific to the mAb; a third segment comprising a cleavable linker sequence; and a fourth segment comprising an antibody or functional fragment thereof. In some embodiments, the fourth segment is a single chain variable fragment (scFv).

The first and second masked mAbs may form a heterodimer complex by occlusion of the first and second antigen recognition sites by the second and first masking epitopes, respectively. The flexible linker may be cleaved by a protease specific to a target tissue allowing the cross-masked mAb heterodimer complex to dissociate at the target tissue. In some aspects, masked mAbs against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were fused with a linker that is susceptible to cleavage by a proteinase to their epitope.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, a masked mAb may include a mAb bound by a protein A-protein L mask (protein A-L) mask.

However, one skilled in the art will understand that the disclosure may be practiced without these details. In other instances, well-known structures and functions have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly being used in the clinical management of diverse disease states, including cancer (Adams and Weiner, 2005). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have shown therapeutic potential in select malignancies including breast cancer. As described in Example 1 below, the combined use of two such mAbs, C225 (Cetuximab) and 425 (EMD55900), reduces growth and survival of EGFR overexpressing MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells more effectively than either antibody alone. Similarly, the C225/425 antibody combination more effectively inhibited AKT and MAPK phosphorylation in MDA-MB-468 cells. Surface plasmon resonance, size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that mAbs C225 and 425 simultaneously bind to distinct antigenic epitopes on domain III of the soluble wild-type EGFR. Furthermore, neither mAb competed with the other for binding to cells expressing either wild-type EGFR or a mutant EGFR (EGFRvIII) associated with neoplasia. Mutagenesis experiments revealed that residues S460/G461 in EGFR domain III are essential components of the 425 epitope and clearly distinguish it from the EGF/TGF&#x3b1; binding site and the C225 interaction interface. Collectively, these results support the conclusion that therapeutic EGFR blockade in cancer patients by combined use of mAbs C225 and 425 could provide advantages over the use of the two antibodies as single agents.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">When used as &#x2018;targeted agents,&#x2019; mAbs generally cause fewer severe side effects than traditional chemotherapy. However, adverse events have been reported and described for many antibody therapeutics due to inadvertent antigen recognition in normal tissues. In the case of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonistic mAbs, dose-limiting toxicities are thought to be due to engagement of the receptor by the therapeutic antibody in normal tissues (Lacouture et al., 2006; Rodeck, 2009).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The Erb tyrosine kinase family includes four members, of which the EGFR and Her2 are frequently deregulated in solid tumors and are of significant interest as therapeutic targets. MAbs to both antigens are used to treat various epithelial cancers. However, EGFR antagonistic mAbs, including Cetuximab (Masui et al., 1984), Matuzumab (Rodeck et al., 1987), and the fully human Panitumumab (Segaert and Van Cutsem, 2005; Van Cutsem et al., 2008), can cause dose-limiting adverse events affecting primarily the skin and the gastrointestinal system (Vanhoefer et al., 2004).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">To address undesirable side effects (or &#x201c;off-target&#x201d; effects) caused by mAbs, antibody &#x201c;prodrugs&#x201d; were developed and tested as described herein. The antibody prodrug design is based on non-covalent protein interactions with the unmodified antibody to occlude of the antigen recognition sites (e.g., the complement determination regions (CDRs)) of mAbs or modulate the dynamics of the CDR through fusion with recombinant antigen fragments (also known as &#x201c;masking epitopes&#x201d;) via a flexible linker. Invasive tumors typically express proteolytic enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), to breakdown the extracellular matrix for invasion and metastasis. Although the MMP family has at least 28 members, MMP-9 is known to correlate with malignancies that respond to epidermal growth factor blockade (Zhou et al. 2006; Swinson et al. 2004; Cox et al. 2000). The presence of these enzymes can distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Occluded antibody prodrugs that are described herein are also known as &#x2018;masked&#x2019; antibodies and their activated counterparts are also known as &#x2018;unmasked&#x2019; antibodies. Occluded or masked mAbs are prevented from binding in normal tissues that express the epitope but do not express MMPs. However, the mask is designed to be susceptible to MMPs. Masked or occluded mAbs may be &#x2018;activated&#x2019; by including tumor protease specific sequences in the linker so that digestion by MMPs causes the mask to fall off. This adds an additional dimension to the current principle of tumor selectivity. Cell surface receptor (epitope) density is accepted as a primary selection basis for antibody targeting. Since these receptors exist in normal tissues, the antibodies also exert their effects in healthy tissues (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>). By adding an additional selection property (i.e., MMP-9 expression), increased tumor specificity may be obtained. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>) Masked and unmasked antibody design has been tested using two EGFR antagonistic antibodies, 425 (Matuzumab) and C225 (Cetuximab); and a HER2 antibody, Trastuzumab.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Any mAb may be developed as a masked antibody. In some embodiments, the masked antibody may be a masked anti-EGFR. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; ErbB-1; HER1) is one of four members of the ErbB receptor family and contributes to growth, survival, migration and differentiation of epithelial cells (Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001). Deregulated signaling through the EGFR either alone or in cooperation with other members of the ErbB family, notably ErbB2 and ErbB3, is a hallmark of multiple neoplasms predominantly of epithelial origin. The molecular mechanisms leading to deregulated EGFR-dependent signaling include overexpression of the EGFR, establishment of autocrine loops by aberrant overexpression of EGFR ligands and, the expression of mutated, constitutively active EGFRs (Mendelsohn and Baselga, 2000; Kim et al., 2001; Nagane et al., 2001).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In recognition of the potential roles of aberrant EGFR activation in tumor progression, multiple antagonists of EGFR activation have been developed with therapeutic intent. These can be broadly divided into two classes: (i) small molecules that target the kinase domain of the EGFR and inhibit its phosphorylation activity and (ii) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) binding to the extracellular domain of the EGFR (Baselga and Arteaga, 2005). Typically, EGFR antagonistic mAbs were selected to disrupt ligand binding to the extracellular domain of the wild-type EGFR. Two examples of EGFR mAbs are the murine mAb 225 and the murine mAb 425. A chimeric version of 225 (C225; Cetuximab; Erbitux) containing a human Fc fragment has been FDA-approved for treatment of several epithelial neoplasias including colorectal carcinoma. A humanized version of 425 (EMD72000; Matuzumab) is currently in Phase II clinical trials in various epithelial neoplasms.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In other embodiments, the masked antibody may be a masked anti-HER2. HER2/ErBB2/Neu is a tyrosine kinase protein receptor which is expressed in the heart, lung, intestine and kidney and its activation is involved in growth and proliferation. HER2 is up-regulated in an aggressive form of metastatic breast cancer making it a potential target for cancer therapy. Herceptin&#xae;/Trastuzumab is a therapeutic humanized monoclonal antibody used to treat HER2 positive breast cancer.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Trastuzumab has been shown to elicit adverse side effects which are thought to be caused by off target binding of the antibody to HER2 expressed in healthy tissues at normal levels. This problem is not limited to Trastuzumab or to mAbs in general, in fact most targeted therapies target a mechanism rather than or in addition to the disease site. These adverse side effects could be prevented by specifically targeting the tumor cells rather than other cells that express HER2 at lower levels.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, a masked antibody may comprise a nucleotide sequence which encodes a first segment comprising a signal sequence; a second segment comprising a masking epitope sequence, wherein the masking epitope sequence contains an epitope specific to the mAb, for example the masking epitope sequence is specific to one or more antigen recognition sites (e.g., CDRs) of the mAb (i.e., is specific to the fourth segment, described below); a third segment comprising a cleavable linker sequence; and a fourth segment comprising an antibody or functional fragment thereof.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">An antibody or functional antibody fragment thereof refers to an immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule that specifically binds to, or is immunologically reactive with a particular antigen, and includes both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The term antibody includes genetically engineered or otherwise modified forms of immunoglobulins, such as intrabodies, chimeric antibodies, fully human antibodies, humanized antibodies, peptibodies and heteroconjugate antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, and tetrabodies). The term functional antibody fragment includes antigen binding fragments of antibodies, including e.g., Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, Fab, Fv, rIgG, and scFv fragments. The term scFv refers to a single chain Fv antibody in which the variable domains of the heavy chain and of the light chain of a traditional two chain antibody have been joined to form one chain.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, the fourth segment is a single chain variable fragment (scFv). Examples of individual masked antibodies are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref> (masked C225; SEQ ID NO:1 (nucleic acid); SEQ ID NO:5 (amino acid)) and 15 (masked 425; SEQ ID NO:2 (nucleic acid); SEQ ID NO:6 (amino acid)). In some embodiments, the fourth segment may be an IgG. The use of an IgG creates a bivalent format with an enhanced affinity to the target.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, two mAbs may form a heterodimer to produce a cross-masked mAb complex, comprising a first masked mAb comprising (1) a first antibody or fragment thereof having an antigen recognition site attached to a first masking epitope via a flexible linker, and (2) a second masked mAb comprising a second antibody or fragment thereof having an antigen recognition site attached to a second masking epitope via a flexible linker. The first and second masked mAbs may form a heterodimer complex by occlusion of the first and second antigen recognition sites by the first and second masking epitopes. The flexible linker may be cleaved by a protease specific to a target tissue allowing the cross-masked mAb heterodimer complex to dissociate at the target tissue.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment of the disclosure, the EGFR antagonistic antibodies, 425 and C225 were selected for development of cross-masked antibodies. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, EGFR domain III, which has an epitope for both 425 and C225, was fused via a cleavable linker to an scFv of C225 and of 425. Point mutations in EGFR domain III favor a heterodimer. When the masked antibody is in the tumor, cleavage by a resident protease releases the EGFR domain III epitope, allowing the antibody to bind its target. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is a schematic view of the overall design to generate IgGs that are masked and do not bind antigen in normal tissues. Cross-masking permits the simultaneous delivery of two antibodies that synergize or target independent oncogenic signaling pathways.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In another embodiment of the disclosure, masked anti-EGFR antibody fragments are generated by cloning domain III of the soluble EGFR (sEGFRdIII) N-terminal to a cleavable linker followed by single chain variable fragment (scFv) versions of the anti-EGFR antibodies Matuzumab (mAb425 or 425) and Cetuximab (mAbC225 or C225) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 17</figref>). In some embodiments, a metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) substrate cleavage site, VPLSLYS (SEQ ID NO:3) (Turk et al., 2001) may be encoded within the cleavable linker. MMP-9 is frequently overexpressed in epithelial malignancies in which EGFR blockade may have therapeutic benefit (Swinson et al., 2004; Cox et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2006).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In another embodiment, a masked anti-HER2 antibody or fragment thereof is generated by cloning domain IV of the HER2 receptor to a cleavable linker followed by an Fc fragment of the anti-HER2 antibody, Trastuzumab (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>). In some embodiments, a metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) substrate cleavage site, VPLSLYS (SEQ ID NO:3) (Turk et al., 2001) may be encoded within the cleavable linker.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one embodiment, a linker that was significantly longer than the minimal possible distance required may be used to address potential geometric problems of epitope association with the scFv and taking into consideration that affinity decays slowly as a function of linker length (Krishnamurthy et al, 2007). In such an embodiment, the serine-glycine rich linker has 12 and 19 residues flanking an MMP-9 sequence, producing an end-to-end length of approximately 133 angstroms (&#x212b;). Crystal structures have revealed the distance between the C-terminus of sEGFRdIII and the N-terminus of the antibody light chains is &#x3e;35.1 &#x212b; for C225 (Li et al., 2005) and 34.7 &#x212b; for 425 (Schmiedel et al., 2008).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In further embodiments, the scFv may be replaced by an IgG, which creates a bivalent format. In this case, overall affinity to the tumor-derived antigen may be significantly enhanced due to energy additivity for the following reasons. First, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates that the bivalent IgG 425 binds with greater affinity than the monovalent scFv. Second, cleaved masking epitopes (which are monomeric) compete poorly with tumor-derived EGFR for the unmasked antibody, and the bivalent interaction with cells may be favored over the monovalent mask interactions. Thus, the cleaved masking epitope is free to diffuse from the tumor site, favoring a higher affinity for the antibody. Moreover, the inclusion of an antibody Fc region enables downregulation of EGFR (Friedman et al., 2005) as well as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (Yan et al., 2008). Third, assuming no new constraints, the occlusion of the antibody binding sites may improve with the use of IgGs, as the masking will be tetravalent. The gain in affinity in the tetravalent format permits the inclusion of additional mutations in the mask to further enhance the dissociation rate of the masks upon protease cleavage.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In other embodiments, a masked antibody may comprise a protein A-protein L (protein A-L) mask that binds to a monoclonal antibody. Protein A (which binds the heavy chain of an antibody variable region) and Protein L (which binds the light chain of an antibody variable region), are two proteins known to bind antibodies, and in some embodiments, may be attached by a protease cleavable linker to take advantage of avidity providing tighter binding than either protein alone (see Example 4 below). Once the masked antibody reaches the tumor cell, the protease site will be cleaved by tumor over-expressing proteases, avidity will be lost, and the mask will dissociate allowing the antibody to bind at the tumor site (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>). The mask will not be significantly cleaved in healthy tissues and therefore will prevent off target binding. In one embodiment (as described in detail in the Examples below), the protein A-L mask binds Trastuzumab, but the protein A-L mask may be used to mask any suitable therapeutic antibody known in the art including, but not limited to, alemtuzumab, bevacizumab, Cetuximab, edrecolomab, gemtuzumab, ibritumomab tiuxetan, Matuzumab, panitumumab, rituximab, tositumomab, and Trastuzumab.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Crystallization of some antibodies has traditionally been challenging due to flexibility of the antibodies. One method of inducing crystallization may include addition of a ligand that changes the solubility of the protein. Therefore, in addition to forming a masked antibody, Protein A, Protein L or a combination of both may be used as &#x2018;additives&#x2019; for Fabs that do not readily crystallize and/or to improve the diffraction limits of the same.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The following examples are provided to better illustrate the embodiments and are not to be interpreted as limiting the scope of any claimed embodiment.

For example, two antibodies to ErbB2 (i.e., Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab) inhibit survival of breast cancer cells more effectively than either antibody alone (Nahta et al., 2004).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The antibodies 425 and C225 both have the capacity to inhibit ligand binding to the EGFR independently, but act synergistically (i.e., a much lower dose of the antibody combination achieved the same biological response) to affect breast tumor cell growth and survival. The C225 binding epitope is in direct competition with EGF/TGF&#x3b1; for binding to domain III of the extracellular portion of the EGFR (Gill et al., 1984; Li et al., 2005). MAb 425 interferes with ligand access to the EGFR (Murthy et al., 1987), but the binding site for 425 is currently unknown. The effects of either antibody alone were compared with those of the combination of both antibodies on growth and survival of MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma cells that express high levels of EGFR (Biscardi et al., 1998). To avoid effects due to differences in antibody concentration the total amount of IgG was kept constant for all experimental conditions. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the combination of the two antibodies is superior to either antibody alone in inhibiting metabolic activity of actively growing, attached MDA-MB-468 cells. The synergistic effect of the antibody combination at 25% growth inhibition is demonstrated by isobologram which depicts equally effective dose pairs (isoboles; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). In this representation, the concentration of one drug required to produce a desired effect is plotted on the horizontal axis while the concentration of another drug producing the same effect is plotted on the vertical axis. A straight line joining these two points represents additive effects expected by the combination of two drugs. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows that, at 25% growth inhibition, the experimental value for the antibody combination lies well below the theoretical additive line consistent with drug synergism. This demonstrates that the combination of the two antibodies is superior to either antibody alone in inhibiting metabolic activity of actively growing MDA-MB-468 cells.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The capacity of the antibody combination to induce cell death in the anchorage-independent state is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. It has been previously demonstrated that EGFR inhibition with either 425 (10 &#x3bc;g/ml) or with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors accelerates apoptosis of epithelial cells maintained in forced suspension culture which precludes extracellular matrix attachment (Jost et al., 2001a; Jost et al., 2001b). A simple method to assay cell survival in these conditions consists of reseeding cells on tissue culture-treated plastic after defined periods of suspension culture and the determination of cell reattachment after 12-24 hours. Treatment with either antibody at 10 &#x3bc;g/ml during suspension culture reduced the number of cells capable of matrix reattachment only marginally irrespective of the culture medium used in these experiments (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). In contrast, the combination of both antibodies where each antibody was used at 5 &#x3bc;g/ml markedly reduced levels of viable reattached cells similar to cultures treated with the small molecule EGFR inhibitor AG1478. This indicates that the antibody combination accelerates death of MBA-MB-468 cells in the anchorage-independent state.</p><p id="h-0011" num="0000">Inhibitory Effects of the C225/425 Antibody Combination on Signal Transduction Events Triggered by EGFR Activation.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">To account for combinatorial inhibitory effects of the C225/425 antibody combination on EGFR-dependent signal transduction events, the effects of the antibodies used either singly or in combination on short-term EGF-induced signal transduction events were determined in serum-starved MDA-MB-468 cells. This revealed more efficient inhibition of AKT and p42/44MAPK phosphorylation in serum-starved cells exposed to EGF and the antibody combination as compared to single antibody treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Moreover, in MDA-MB-468 cells, 425 treatment alone did not inhibit AKT and MAPK phosphorylation, whereas it effectively reduced EGF-dependent phosphorylation of the EGFR on Y1068. As in the case of cell growth inhibition experiments, the effects on signal transduction events occurred although either antibody was used at half the concentration (5 &#x3bc;g/ml) when combined as compared to single antibody treatments (10 &#x3bc;g/ml). Therefore, the C225/425 antibody combination effects were similar to those achieved by using AG1478 at very high concentration (10 &#x3bc;M).</p><p id="h-0012" num="0000">Simultaneous Binding of 425 and C225 to the Extracellular Domain of the EGFR.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Cooperative growth inhibitory effects by the two antibodies can be explained by the binding of these antibodies to distinct EGFR populations thus providing more effective ligand binding competition. Alternatively, the two antibodies may simultaneously engage distinct epitopes of the EGFR domain III and inhibit EGFR-dependent signal transduction by independent mechanisms. To distinguish between these two possibilities, surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed whereby either antibody was immobilized on a CM5 chip and successive binding of soluble extracellular domain of the EGFR and the second antibody was monitored. First, binding of sEGFR to either 425 or C225 immobilized on the chip was characterized, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. Lower RUs (&#x2dc;200 RU) of mAbs were conjugated to avoid mass transport limitations. Additionally, sEGFR was injected at a high flow rate of 50 &#x3bc;l/min in order to overcome potential receptor rebinding effects. The resultant sensorgrams were then analyzed and the equilibrium rate constants were calculated. Each different concentration of injected sEGFR is represented by a real time sensorgrams (lighter, wavy lines) while the calculated kinetic fit of each interaction is represented by superimposed smooth black line. The results showed that C225 binds to sEGFR with a higher affinity (2.7&#xb1;0.4 nM) compared to 425 (32.3&#xb1;6.75 nM) due to a comparatively higher dissociation rate of 425.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Next, it was determined whether sEGFR bound to C225 immobilized on the chip was capable of capturing 425. To this end, sEGFR (5 nM) was injected over a low density C225 chip (280 RU) followed by different concentrations of 425 (0-512 nM) until binding equilibrium was reached. The sensorgrams show binding of concentration-dependent binding of 425 to sEGFR captured by C225 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>), consistent with noncompetitive binding of the two antibodies to sEGFR.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">To obtain independent confirmation for simultaneous binding of both antibodies to EGFR, a sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed by analytical ultracentrifugation using an admixture of C225, 425 and the extracellular portion of the EGFR consisting of domains I to IV (sEGFR). This indicated a single species with an apparent weight of 167 kD, consistent with the existence of a 1:1:1 tripartite molecular complex (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref>). Note that total concentration was at 4.5 &#x3bc;M or &#x3e;100-fold and &#x3e;1000-fold the dissociation constant of 425 or C225 and EFGR, respectively. Together, these results strongly suggest that the binding epitopes of C225 and 425 are distinct albeit both are confined to domain III of the extracellular portion of the human EGFR (Lax et al., 1991).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Next it was determined whether both antibodies could also simultaneously engage the EGFR expressed on cell surfaces. NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with either full length wild-type human EGFR (CO12 cells) or a mutated EGFR characterized by intragenic deletion of most of domain II of the EGFR and prominently expressed in neoplasia (HC2 cells) were used for this purpose (Moscatello et al., 1996). Both antibodies bind exclusively to domain III of the EGFR (Lax et al., 1991), and therefore may bind to both wild-type and tumor-specific EGFRvIII. To avoid confounding effects of endogenous EGFR expression, transfected mouse 3T3 cells were used rather than human cells. Since neither antibody recognizes the murine EGFR (Murthy et al., 1987; Wen et al., 2001), no binding other than to the transfected human EGFR was measured. To assess direct binding competition between the two antibodies, the ability of 425 to replace C225 from the cell surface of CO12 and HC2 cells was determined by FACS analysis. The results showed that each antibody competes with itself for cell surface binding but not with the other antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-D</figref>). In addition, both antibodies recognized both human wild-type EGFR and EGFRvIII. These results indicate that both C225 and 425 antibodies independently and simultaneously bind to distinct epitopes on domain III of the extracellular portion of recombinant human EGFR and cell associated EGFR.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">C225 directly competes with ligand binding to domain III of the EGFR (Li et al., 2005) and 425 is also known to bind to domain III even though its epitope has yet to be defined. Therefore, the 425 binding site may encompass residues that are different in the human and murine EGFR sequences, since 425 recognizes a conformationally defined epitope of the human but not the murine EGFR (Murthy et al., 1987). Residues that differ between the murine and human sequences and are present on the surface of the sEGFR domain III are likely candidates for the epitope defined by 425 binding. In addition, because C225 and 425 bind simultaneously to the surface of EGFR domain III, the 425 epitope likely lies outside of the surface masked by C225.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Mapping of the human EGFR using these constraints produced a handful of potential EGFR/425 interaction sites (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Many of these sites are located near glycosylation sites and were considered unlikely targets for 425 binding because it was previously shown that 425 recognizes a protein epitope on the deglycosylated EGFR (Murthy et al., 1987). After exclusion of residues occluded by either C225 or by putative carbohydrate side chains, two adjacent amino acids emerged as likely candidates for 425 docking (Ser460 and Gly461 highlighted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). To investigate the role of these residues in 425 binding, these two residues were changed in human EGFR domain III to the corresponding murine sequence, (i.e., Pro460 and Asn461), expressed and purified this domain, and used size exclusion chromatography to test whether 425 could bind sEGFR domain III encoding S460P and G461N mutations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The individual Fabs and sEGFR domain III proteins eluted at 15.6 mL. Co-incubation of sEGFR domain IIIS460P/G461N with Fab425 resulted in a slightly earlier elution, 15.2 mL, indicating weak association. The concentration of the mixture added to the column is 4 &#x3bc;M, which is greater than the KD of the native EGFR/425 interaction by a factor of 125, indicating a weak association. Similarly, mutations that define the C225 epitope on EGFR-domain III reduce the affinity from 2.3 nM to 340 nM (Li et al., 2005) and a complex formed by such a mutant and C225 also show residual binding wherein the concentration is greater than the original KD (e.g., &#x2dc;290 nM) by a factor of 125. However, human sEGFR domain III at the same concentration forms a saturated complex that eluted at 13.9 mL. To demonstrate that the point mutations did not affect the tertiary structure of the sEFGR domain III, the S460P and G461N mutant were also mixed with C225 Fab and subjected to analysis by size exclusion chromatography. The resulting elution point at 14.0 mL was similar to the wild-type sEGFR domain III complexed with C225. Finally, when wild-type sEGFR domain III and both Fabs were mixed and applied to the column, a distinct peak eluting at 13.1 mL emerged, consistent with a tripartite complex. These data indicate that Ser460 and Gly461 significantly contribute to the overall affinity of the EGFR-425 interaction.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Because 425 does not compete with C225 for binding and recognizes surface residues distinct from the ligand binding site, a different mechanism of action that is independent of C225 and the ligand may account for its biological effects. Specifically, interaction of 425 with the EGFR may interfere with high affinity ligand binding by blocking a conformational change to bring domains I and III of the extracellular domain of the EGFR in close proximity.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading><heading id="h-0014" level="1">EGFR-Specific scFvs Engineered to Enable Selective Antigen Recognition Upon Proteolytic Activation</heading><p id="h-0015" num="0000">Generation of C225 and 425 Masked mAbs</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The masked scFvs were produced as secreted proteins from insect cells infected with baculovirus and were purified by Ni-affinity and size exclusion chromatography.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Domain III of the soluble epidermal growth factor receptor (sEGFRdIII, comprising residues 310-512) was cloned into pAcSG2 behind the human EGFR secretion signal sequence. To this was added a flexible, glycine-serine linker containing the matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) consensus protease site-VPLSLYS (SEQ ID NO:3) and finally a single chain variable region (scFv) anti-EGFR antibody. The full linker sequence is (GGGSGGGSGGGSVPLSLYSGSTSGSGKSSEGSGSGAQG) (SEQ ID NO:4; MMP-9 protease site is underlined). Both scFv constructs of C225 and 425 were assembled V<sub>L</sub>-linker-V<sub>H</sub>. C-terminal FLAG (425 only) and hexahistadine tags (C225 and 425) were also added. This vector was mixed with linearized baculovirus DNA (BD Biosciences), transfected and expanded for three rounds before confirming viral titers. Large-scale expression (5 L) was conducted in suspension culture. The media was separated from cellular material and diafiltered against purification buffer as described previously (Ferguson et al., 2000). Protein purification was accomplished using a nickel-NTA column followed by a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 preparative column (Amersham).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Secreted masked mAbC225 scFv contained a mixture of the expected length and digested fragments. Analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of the purified material indicated dimeric species, but no monomeric or oligomeric species. Treatment of the purified material with MMP-9 and analysis by SEC indicated that the homodimeric complex was cleaved (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). In addition, SDS-PAGE of the protease-treated, homodimeric complex indicated that MMP-9 cleavage was specific, producing two bands of the predicted molecular weight and no cleavage of the individual domains or scFv linker. Together, this suggests that the linker may interfere with the intramolecular association of the epitope to the scFv (e.g., a single masked species), potentially reflecting a combination of steric clashes and an entropic penalty. These data provide evidence that it is possible to mask the complement-determining region (CDR) and cleave the masking agent.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Since a dimeric interaction was observed, a heterodimeric or crossed-masked design was also produced to simultaneously deliver two therapeutic antibodies to the tumor site was also considered. The utility of such a design is justified by studies, as described in Example 1, which show that the combination of C225 and 425 act synergistically to inhibit EGF-stimulated cell growth and survival (Kamat et al., 2008), and is more effective in eliciting complement-dependent tumor cell lysis than other combinations of anti-EGFR antibodies with C225 (Dechant et al., 2008). To favor assembly of &#x2018;cross-masked&#x2019; 425/C225 complexes wherein the mask linked to C225 scFv binds to 425 scFv (and vice versa), the native epitopes were altered by introducing point mutations that diminish intramolecular affinity but not intermolecular complex formation. Hexahistidine and FLAG tags facilitated purification and detection. Purification by affinity and size exclusion chromatography of the masked 425 and C225 scFvs yielded undigested material of greater than 95% purity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>).

The scFv constructs bound with weaker affinity of 260&#xb1;40 and 110&#xb1;20 nM, respectively. After characterizing these antibody fragments, the masked antibodies were measured singly or as a heterodimer before and after MMP-9 digestion. For masked C225 scFv and masked 425 scFv, no difference in affinity as compared to the respective unmasked scFvs was observed, demonstrating that the point mutations interfere with self-association. However, the CDRs of the cross-masked 425/C225 scFvs were effectively occluded, as shown by weak binding to sEGFRdIII.

First, the association of masked 425 with HaCaT cells showed little dependence on MMP-9 digestion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). This is consistent with the intramolecular mask being unable to occlude the linked 425 antibody and consistent with the SPR results.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, the binding of the mAb to SKBR3 cells showed a dose-dependent inhibition by the increasing amount of H4Fc in the system. The addition of MMP9 to the wildtype H4Fc containing sample restored some binding of the mAb to cells. On the other hand, the mutated H4Fc containing samples showed no difference whether MMP9 was added or not.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">EXAMPLE 4</heading><heading id="h-0021" level="1">Modulation of Antibody Binding Kinetics Via Non-Covalent Masking</heading><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Diffraction Studies of Protein A and Protein L Bound to Trastuzumab.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The Trastuzumab Fab was co-crystallized with protein A and protein L.
