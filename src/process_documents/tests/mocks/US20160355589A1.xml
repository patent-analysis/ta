Blockade of inhibitory IMRs appears to unleash potent tumor-specific immune responses more effectively than direct stimulation of tumor-immunity with activating cytokines or tumor vaccines, and this approach has the potential to transform human cancer therapy. An important implication and opportunity now arises for the potential to develop new antibody antagonists for other IMRs and to combine antagonist antibodies to more than one IMR in order to increase the proportion of responders in oncology clinical trials, as well as, expand upon oncology indications in which tumor immunotherapy treatments are effective.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Significantly, inhibitory IMRs and ligands that regulate cellular immunity are commonly overexpressed on tumor cells and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). Notably, overexpression of PD-L1 in tumors is associated with tumor specific T cell exhaustion and a poor prognosis. Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 ligation in clinical trials resulted in durable tumor regression responses in a substantial proportion of patients. A recent report demonstrated that co-expression of PD-1 and another inhibitory IMR (TIM-3) in melanoma patient derived tumor-specific CD8+ T cells was associated with more dysfunctional T cell exhaustion phenotypes compared to cells expressing either IMR alone. Moreover, several reports using pre-clinical tumor models demonstrated blockade of multiple IMRs, including PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3 and CTLA-4 more effectively induced anti-tumor responses than antagonizing PD-1 alone. These results underscore the importance of further investigating IMR pathways.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains) is an immunomodulatory receptor expressed primarily on activated T cells and NK cells. TIGIT is also known as VSIG9; VSTM3; and WUCAM. Its structure shows one extracellular immunoglobulin domain, a type 1 transmembrane region and two ITIM motifs. TIGIT forms part of a co-stimulatory network that consists of positive (CD226) and negative (TIGIT) immunomodulatory receptors on T cells, and ligands expressed on APCs (CD155 and CD112).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An important feature in the structure of TIGIT is the presence of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic tail domain. As with PD-1 and CTLA-4, the ITIM domain in the cytoplasmic region of TIGIT is predicted to recruit tyrosine phosphatases, such as SHP-1 and SHP-2, and subsequent de-phosphorylation of tyrosine residues with in the immunoreceptor tyrosine-base activation motifs (ITAM) on T cell receptor (TCR) subunits. Hence, ligation of TIGIT by receptor-ligands CD155 and CD112 expressed by tumor cells or TAMS may contribute to the suppression of TCR-signaling and T cell activation, which is essential for mounting effective anti-tumor immunity. Thus, an antagonist antibody specific for TIGIT could inhibit the CD155 and CD112 induced suppression of T cell responses and enhance anti-tumor immunity.

In some embodiments, the anti-TIGIT antibodies are isolated.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0115">As used herein, an anti-TIGIT antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof refers to an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to human TIGIT. An antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that &#x201c;specifically binds to human TIGIT&#x201d; is an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds to human TIGIT with a KD of about 1 nM or a higher affinity (e.g., 1 nM-2 pM, 1 nM, 100 pM, 10 pM or 2 pM), but does not bind to other proteins lacking this sequence. For example, an antibody that &#x201c;specifically binds&#x201d; human TIGIT does not bind to human CD226, human CD155 and human CD112. As a further example, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment that specifically binds to human TIGIT may bind to a FLAG&#xae;-tagged form of human TIGIT but will not bind to other FLAG&#xae;-tagged proteins that lack human TIGIT epitopes. In one embodiment, the antibody of the invention which specifically binds to human TIGIT is also cross-reactive with cynomolgus and rhesus TIGIT. As used herein &#x201c;cross-reactivity&#x201d; refers to the ability of an antibody to react with a homologous protein from other species. Whether an antibody specifically binds to human TIGIT can be determined using any assay known in the art. Examples of assays known in the art to determining binding affinity include surface plasmon resonance (e.g., BIACORE) or a similar technique (e.g. KinExa or OCTET).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0116">The present invention includes anti-TIGIT antibodies and methods of use thereof. As used herein, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; refers to any form of antibody that exhibits the desired biological activity. Thus, it is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers, but is not limited to, monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies comprising two light chains and two heavy chains), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), humanized antibodies, fully human antibodies, chimeric antibodies and camelized single domain antibodies.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0117">The present invention includes non-human parental (e.g. mouse and rodent) anti-TIGIT antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof and methods of use thereof. These antibodies may be modified for an intended use, such as humanization of an antibody for use as a human therapeutic antibody or fragment.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0118">The present invention includes anti-TIGIT antigen-binding fragments and methods of use thereof. As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; or &#x201c;antigen-binding fragment&#x201d; refers to antigen-binding fragments of antibodies, i.e. antibody fragments that retain the ability to bind specifically to the antigen bound by the full-length antibody, e.g. fragments that retain one or more CDR regions. Examples of antigen-binding fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules, e.g., sc-Fv; nanobodies and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0119">The present invention includes anti-TIGIT Fab fragments and methods of use thereof. A &#x201c;Fab fragment&#x201d; is comprised of one light chain and the C<sub>H</sub>1 and variable regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of a Fab molecule cannot form a disulfide bond with another heavy chain molecule. An &#x201c;Fab fragment&#x201d; can be the product of papain cleavage of an antibody.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0120">The present invention includes anti-TIGIT antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof which comprise an Fc region and methods of use thereof. An &#x201c;Fc&#x201d; region contains two heavy chain fragments comprising the C<sub>H</sub>1 and C<sub>H</sub>2 domains of an antibody. The two heavy chain fragments are held together by two or more disulfide bonds and by hydrophobic interactions of the C<sub>H</sub>3 domains.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0121">The present invention includes anti-TIGIT Fab&#x2032; fragments and methods of use thereof. A &#x201c;Fab&#x2032; fragment&#x201d; contains one light chain and a portion or fragment of one heavy chain that contains the V<sub>H </sub>domain and the C<sub>H</sub>1 domain and also the region between the C<sub>H</sub>1 and C<sub>H</sub>2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between the two heavy chains of two Fab&#x2032; fragments to form a F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>molecule.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0122">The present invention includes anti-TIGIT F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments and methods of use thereof.

A F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment thus is composed of two Fab&#x2032; fragments that are held together by a disulfide bond between the two heavy chains. An &#x201c;F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment&#x201d; can be the product of pepsin cleavage of an antibody.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0123">The present invention includes anti-TIGIT Fv fragments and methods of use thereof. The &#x201c;Fv region&#x201d; comprises the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains, but lacks the constant regions.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0124">The present invention includes anti-TIGIT scFv fragments and methods of use thereof. The term &#x201c;single-chain Fv&#x201d; or &#x201c;scFv&#x201d; antibody refers to antibody fragments comprising the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains of an antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen-binding.

A &#x201c;domain antibody&#x201d; is an immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragment containing only the variable region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain. In some instances, two or more V<sub>H </sub>regions are covalently joined with a peptide linker to create a bivalent domain antibody. The two V<sub>H </sub>regions of a bivalent domain antibody may target the same or different antigens.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0126">The present invention includes anti-TIGIT bivalent antibodies and methods of use thereof. A &#x201c;bivalent antibody&#x201d; comprises two antigen-binding sites. In some instances, the two binding sites have the same antigen specificities. However, bivalent antibodies may be bispecific (see below).</p><p id="p-0111" num="0127">The present invention includes anti-TIGIT camelized single domain antibodies and methods of use thereof. In certain embodiments, antibodies herein also include camelized single domain antibodies. See, e.g., Muyldermans et al. (2001) <i>Trends Biochem. Sci. </i>26:230; Reichmann et al. (1999) <i>J. Immunol. Methods </i>231:25; WO 94/04678; WO 94/25591; U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,079). In one embodiment, the present invention provides single domain antibodies comprising two V<sub>H </sub>domains with modifications such that single domain antibodies are formed.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0128">The present invention includes anti-TIGIT diabodies and methods of use thereof. As used herein, the term &#x201c;diabodies&#x201d; refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V<sub>H</sub>) connected to a light chain variable domain (V<sub>L</sub>) in the same polypeptide chain (V<sub>H</sub>&#x2014;V<sub>L </sub>or V<sub>L</sub>&#x2014;V<sub>H</sub>). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, e.g., EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Holliger et al. (1993) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>90: 6444-6448. For a review of engineered antibody variants generally see Holliger and Hudson (2005) <i>Nat. Biotechnol. </i>23:1126-1136.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0129">Typically, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention which is modified in some way retains at least 10% of its binding activity (when compared to the parental antibody) when that activity is expressed on a molar basis. Preferably, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention retains at least 20%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 100% or more of the TIGIT binding affinity as the parental antibody. It is also intended that an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention can include conservative or non-conservative amino acid substitutions (referred to as &#x201c;conservative variants&#x201d; or &#x201c;function conserved variants&#x201d; of the antibody) that do not substantially alter its biologic activity.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0130">The present invention includes isolated anti-TIGIT antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof and methods of use thereof &#x201c;Isolated&#x201d; antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof are at least partially free of other biological molecules from the cells or cell cultures in which they are produced. Such biological molecules include nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, or other material such as cellular debris and growth medium. An isolated antibody or antigen-binding fragment may further be at least partially free of expression system components such as biological molecules from a host cell or of the growth medium thereof. Generally, the term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; is not intended to refer to a complete absence of such biological molecules or to an absence of water, buffers, or salts or to components of a pharmaceutical formulation that includes the antibodies or fragments.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0131">The present invention includes monoclonal anti-TIGIT antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof as well as monoclonal compositions comprising a plurality of isolated monoclonal antibodies. The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the antibody molecules comprising the population are identical in amino acid sequence except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. In contrast, conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations typically include a multitude of different antibodies having different amino acid sequences in their variable domains, particularly their CDRs that are often specific for different epitopes. The modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. (1975) <i>Nature </i>256: 495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The &#x201c;monoclonal antibodies&#x201d; may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. (1991) <i>Nature </i>352: 624-628 and Marks et al. (1991) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>222: 581-597, for example. See also Presta (2005) <i>J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. </i>116:731.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0132">The present invention includes anti-TIGIT chimeric antibodies (e.g., human constant domain/mouse variable domain) and methods of use thereof. As used herein, a &#x201c;chimeric antibody&#x201d; is an antibody having the variable domain from a first antibody and the constant domain from a second antibody, where the first and second antibodies are from different species. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., (1984) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>81: 6851-6855). Typically, the variable domains are obtained from an antibody from an experimental animal (the &#x201c;parental antibody&#x201d;), such as a rodent, and the constant domain sequences are obtained from human antibodies, so that the resulting chimeric antibody will be less likely to elicit an adverse immune response in a human subject than the parental (e.g., mouse) antibody.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0133">The present invention includes anti-TIGIT humanized antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof (e.g., rat or mouse antibodies that have been humanized) and methods of use thereof. The invention includes any humanized version of the 14A6 antibody (comprising SEQ ID NOs:7 and 8), the 28H5 antibody (comprising SEQ ID NOs:63 and 64) and the 31C6 antibody (comprising SEQ ID NOs: 94-95). As used herein, the term &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d; refers to forms of antibodies that contain sequences from both human and non-human (e.g., mouse or rat) antibodies. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the framework (FR) regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody may optionally comprise at least a portion of a human immunoglobulin constant region (Fc).</p><p id="p-0118" num="0134">In general, the basic antibody structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer includes two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one &#x201c;light&#x201d; (about 25 kDa) and one &#x201c;heavy&#x201d; chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of the heavy chain may define a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Typically, human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Furthermore, human heavy chains are typically classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a &#x201c;J&#x201d; region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a &#x201c;D&#x201d; region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, <i>Fundamental Immunology </i>Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0135">The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site. Thus, in general, an intact antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are, in general, the same.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0136">Typically, the variable domains of both the heavy and light chains comprise three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions (CDRs), located within relatively conserved framework regions (FR). The CDRs are usually aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. In general, from N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chains variable domains comprise FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is, generally, in accordance with the definitions of <i>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest</i>, Kabat, et al.; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.; 5<sup>th </sup>ed.; NIH Publ. No. 91-3242 (1991); Kabat (1978) <i>Adv. Prot. Chem. </i>32:1-75; Kabat, et al., (1977) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>252:6609-6616; Chothia, et al., (1987) <i>J Mol.

The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a &#x201c;complementarity determining region&#x201d; or &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; (i.e. CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3 in the light chain variable domain and CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 in the heavy chain variable domain).

As used herein, the term &#x201c;framework&#x201d; or &#x201c;FR&#x201d; residues refers to those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues defined herein as CDR residues.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0138">&#x201c;Isolated nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; or &#x201c;isolated polynucleotide&#x201d; means a DNA or RNA of genomic, mRNA, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof which is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the isolated polynucleotide is found in nature, or is linked to a polynucleotide to which it is not linked in nature. For purposes of this disclosure, it should be understood that &#x201c;a nucleic acid molecule comprising&#x201d; a particular nucleotide sequence does not encompass intact chromosomes. Isolated nucleic acid molecules &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; specified nucleic acid sequences may include, in addition to the specified sequences, coding sequences for up to ten or even up to twenty or more other proteins or portions or fragments thereof, or may include operably linked regulatory sequences that control expression of the coding region of the recited nucleic acid sequences, and/or may include vector sequences.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0139">The phrase &#x201c;control sequences&#x201d; refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to use promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0140">A nucleic acid or polynucleotide is &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, but not always, &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase.

For example, standard ELISA assays can be used in which a recombinant TIGIT (e.g., human TIGIT) protein is immobilized on the plate, one of the antibodies is fluorescently labeled and the ability of non-labeled antibodies to compete off the binding of the labeled antibody is evaluated. Additionally or alternatively, BIAcore analysis can be used to assess the ability of the antibodies to cross-compete. The ability of a test antibody to inhibit the binding of another antibody (for example, antibody 14A6 or 28H5 or 31C6) to TIGIT (e.g., human TIGIT) demonstrates that the test antibody can compete with another antibody (e.g., 14A6 or 28H5 or 31C6) for binding to TIGIT (e.g., human TIGIT) and thus, may, in some cases, bind to the same epitope on TIGIT (e.g., human TIGIT) as antibody 14A6 or 28H5 or 31C6 or to an overlapping epitope.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0147">As stated above, antibodies and fragments that bind to the same epitope as any of the anti-TIGIT antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof of the present invention also form part of the present invention. Further, antibodies that bind to an epitope that overlaps with the epitope bound by any of the anti-TIGIT antibodies of the invention also form part of the present invention. There are several methods available for mapping antibody epitopes on target antigens, including: H/D-Ex Mass spec, X-ray crystallography, pepscan analysis and site directed mutagenesis. For example, HDX (Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange) coupled with proteolysis and mass spectrometry can be used to determine the epitope of an antibody on a specific antigen Y. HDX-MS relies on the accurate measurement and comparison of the degree of deuterium incorporation by an antigen when incubated in D<sub>2</sub>O on its own and in presence of its antibody at various time intervals. Deuterium is exchanged with hydrogen on the amide backbone of the proteins in exposed areas whereas regions of the antigen bound to the antibody will be protected and will show less or no exchange after analysis by LC-MS/MS of proteolytic fragments. Example 9 exemplifies the use of HDX to map the epitope bound by antibody 14A6.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0148">Examples of the immunoglobulin chains of anti-TIGIT antibodies of the invention as well as their CDRs include, but are not limited those disclosed in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOs: 1-30, 37-52, 57-83 or 88-167).

Those of skill in this art recognize that, in general, single amino acid substitutions in non-essential regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity (see, e.g., Watson et al. (1987) <i>Molecular Biology of the Gene</i>, The Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co., p. 224 (4th Ed.)). In addition, substitutions of structurally or functionally similar amino acids are less likely to disrupt biological activity.

For example, the present invention includes the polynucleotides encoding the amino acids described in SEQ ID NOs: 1-30, 37-52, 57-83 and 88-167, as well as polynucleotides which hybridize thereto and, also, any polypeptide encoded by such a hybridizing polynucleotide. In one embodiment, the invention comprises a nucleic acid sequence comprising or consisting essentially of SEQ ID NO:84 or SEQ ID NO:85.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0155">In general, the polynucleotides hybridize under low, moderate or high stringency conditions, and encode antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof that maintain the ability to bind to TIGIT (human, rhesus and/or cynomolgous monkey, e.g., <i>Macaca fascicularis</i>). A first polynucleotide molecule is &#x201c;hybridizable&#x201d; to a second polynucleotide molecule when a single stranded form of the first polynucleotide molecule can anneal to the second polynucleotide molecule under the appropriate conditions of temperature and solution ionic strength (see Sambrook, et al., supra). The conditions of temperature and ionic strength determine the &#x201c;stringency&#x201d; of the hybridization. Typical low stringency hybridization conditions include 55&#xb0; C., 5&#xd7;SSC, 0.1% SDS and no formamide; or 30% formamide, 5&#xd7;SSC, 0.5% SDS at 42&#xb0; C. Typical moderate stringency hybridization conditions are 40% formamide, with 5&#xd7; or 6&#xd7;SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42&#xb0; C. High stringency hybridization conditions are 50% formamide, 5&#xd7; or 6&#xd7;SSC at 42&#xb0; C. or, optionally, at a higher temperature (e.g., 57&#xb0; C., 59&#xb0; C., 60&#xb0; C., 62&#xb0; C., 63&#xb0; C., 65&#xb0; C. or 68&#xb0; C.). In general, SSC is 0.15M NaCl and 0.015M Na-citrate. Hybridization requires that the two polynucleotide contain complementary sequences, although, depending on the stringency of the hybridization, mismatches between bases are possible. The appropriate stringency for hybridizing polynucleotides depends on the length of the polynucleotides and the degree of complementation, variables well known in the art. The greater the degree of similarity or homology between two nucleotide sequences, the higher the stringency under which the nucleic acids may hybridize. For hybrids of greater than 100 nucleotides in length, equations for calculating the melting temperature have been derived (see Sambrook, et al., supra, 9.50-9.51). For hybridization with shorter polynucleotides, e.g., oligonucleotides, the position of mismatches becomes more important, and the length of the oligonucleotide determines its specificity (see Sambrook, et al., supra, 11.7-11.8).</p><p id="p-0141" num="0156">In another embodiment, an isolated polynucleotide, for example DNA, encoding the polypeptide chains of the isolated antibodies or antigen-binding fragments set forth herein is provided.

The increase of the activity of an immune cell can be detected using any method known in the art. In one embodiment, the increase in activity of an immune cell can be detected by measuring the proliferation of the immune cell. For example, an increase in activity of a T cell can be detected by measuring the proliferation of the T cell or signal transduction events such as tyrosine phosphorylation of immune receptors or downstream kinases that transmit signals to transcriptional regulators. In other embodiments, the increase in activity of an immune cell can be detected by measuring CTL or NK cell cytotoxic function on specific target cells or IFN&#x3b3; cytokine responses, which are associated with stimulation of anti-tumor immunity. In yet other embodiments, the increase in activity of an immune cell can be detected by measuring T cell activation ex vivo in a sample derived from the subject. In one embodiment, the increase in T cell activity is determined by: (i) measuring SEB (<i>Staphylococcus </i>Enterotoxin B) induced production of one or more pro-inflammatory cytokines selected from the group consisting of: IL-2, TNF&#x3b1;, IL-17, IFN&#x3b3;, IL-1&#x3b2;, GM-CSF, RANTES, IL-6, IL-8, IL-5 and IL-13; or (ii) measuring mixed lymphocyte reactions or direct anti-CD3 mAb stimulation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling to induce production of a cytokine selected from the group consisting of: IL-2, TNF&#x3b1;, IL-17, IFN&#x3b3;, IL-1&#x3b2;, GM-CSF, RANTES, IL-6, IL-8, IL-5 and IL-13.

An antagonist anti-TIGIT antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof antagonizes an activity of human TIGIT such as by inhibiting TIGIT binding to CD155 and CD112, and inhibiting functional ITIM signal transduction by TIGIT upon binding to CD155 and CD112. Measurement of anti-TIGIT antagonist activity can be assessed by demonstrating blocking of T cell suppression following TCR activation induced by TIGIT ligation with cognate ligands CD155 and CD112. Hence, in one embodiment of increased responses, treating with antagonist anti-TIGIT antibodies are able to rescue IL-2 responses to levels observed in T cells that are not repressed by CD155 or CD112 induction of TIGIT. In a more preferred level of activation, responses, following treatment with an anti-TIGIT antagonist antibody may increase responses to a level higher than T cell responses not repressed by CD155 or CD112.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Ability of Anti-hTIGIT Antibodies to Block Binding to hCD155 and hCD112</heading><p id="p-0170" num="0185">In some embodiments, the anti-TIGIT antibodies or antigen binding fragments of the invention are able to block binding of human TIGIT to human CD155 and human CD112.

Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96, 1985), and electric field based electrofusion using a Cyto Pulse large chamber cull fusion electroporator (Cyto Pulse Sciences, Inc., Glen Burnie, Md.). Preferably, mouse splenocytes are isolated and fused with PEG or by electrofusion to a mouse myeloma cell line based upon standard protocols. The resulting hybridomas may then be screened for the production of antigen-specific antibodies. For example, single cell suspensions of splenic lymphocytes from immunized mice may by fused to one-sixth the number of P3&#xd7;63-Ag8.653 nonsecreting mouse myeloma cells (ATCC, CRL 1580) with 50% PEG. Cells may be plated at approximately 2&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells/mL in a flat bottom microtiter plate, followed by a two week incubation in selective medium containing 20% fetal Clone Serum, 18% &#x201c;653&#x201d; conditioned media, 5% origen (IGEN), 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5 mM HEPES, 0.055 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 mg/ml gentamycin and 1&#xd7;HAT (Sigma; the HAT is added 24 hours after the fusion). After two weeks, cells may be cultured in medium in which the HAT is replaced with HT. Individual wells may then be screened by ELISA for anti-TIGIT monoclonal IgG antibodies. Once extensive hybridoma growth occurs, medium can be observed usually after 10-14 days. The antibody secreting hybridomas may be replated, screened again, and if still positive for human IgG, anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibodies, can be subcloned at least twice by limiting dilution. The stable subclones may then be cultured in vitro to generate small amounts of antibody in tissue culture medium for characterization.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0187">Thus, the present invention includes methods for making an anti-TIGIT antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention comprising culturing a hybridoma cell that expresses the antibody or fragment under condition favorable to such expression and, optionally, isolating the antibody or fragment from the hybridoma and/or the growth medium (e.g. cell culture medium).</p><p id="p-0173" num="0188">The anti-TIGIT antibodies disclosed herein may also be produced recombinantly (e.g., in an <i>E. coli</i>/T7 expression system, a mammalian cell expression system or a lower eukaryote expression system).

These include, inter alia, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, NSO, SP2 cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), A549 cells, 3T3 cells, HEK-293 cells and a number of other cell lines. Mammalian host cells include human, mouse, rat, dog, monkey, pig, goat, bovine, horse and hamster cells. Cell lines of particular preference are selected through determining which cell lines have high expression levels. Other cell lines that may be used are insect cell lines, such as Sf9 cells, amphibian cells, bacterial cells, plant cells and fungal cells.

Further, expression of antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof and immunoglobulin chains of the invention (or other moieties therefrom) from production cell lines can be enhanced using a number of known techniques. For example, the glutamine synthetase gene expression system (the GS system) is a common approach for enhancing expression under certain conditions. The GS system is discussed in whole or part in connection with European Patent Nos. 0 216 846, 0 256 055, and 0 323 997 and European Patent Application No. 89303964.4. Thus, in an embodiment of the invention, the mammalian host cells (e.g., CHO) lack a glutamine synthetase gene and are grown in the absence of glutamine in the medium wherein, however, the polynucleotide encoding the immunoglobulin chain comprises a glutamine synthetase gene which complements the lack of the gene in the host cell.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0195">The present invention includes methods for purifying an anti-TIGIT antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention comprising introducing a sample comprising the antibody or fragment to a purification medium (e.g., cation exchange medium, anion exchange medium, hydrophobic exchange medium, affinity purification medium (e.g., protein-A, protein-G, protein-A/G, protein-L)) and either collecting purified antibody or fragment from the flow-through fraction of said sample that does not bind to the medium; or, discarding the flow-through fraction and eluting bound antibody or fragment from the medium and collecting the eluate.

However, all antibodies encoded by the nucleic acid molecules provided herein, or comprising the amino acid sequences provided herein, comprise the instant invention, independent of the glycosylation pattern the antibodies may have. Similarly, in particular embodiments, antibodies with a glycosylation pattern comprising only non-fucosylated N-glycans may be advantageous, because these antibodies have been shown to typically exhibit more potent efficacy than their fucosylated counterparts both in vitro and in vivo (See for example, Shinkawa et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>278: 3466-3473 (2003); U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,946,292 and 7,214,775).

A polyclonal antibody is an antibody which was produced among or in the presence of one or more other, non-identical antibodies. In general, polyclonal antibodies are produced from collections of different B-lymphocytes, e.g., the B-lymphocyte of an animal treated with an immunogen of interest, which produces a population of different antibodies but which are all directed to the immunogen.

A bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites.

There are at least five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4; IgA1 and IgA2. The invention comprises antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of any of these classes or subclasses of antibodies.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0201">In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment comprises a heavy chain constant region, e.g. a human constant region, such as &#x3b3;1, &#x3b3;2, &#x3b3;3, or &#x3b3;4 human heavy chain constant region or a variant thereof. In another embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment comprises a light chain constant region, e.g. a human light chain constant region, such as lambda or kappa human light chain region or variant thereof. By way of example, and not limitation the human heavy chain constant region can be &#x3b3;4 and the human light chain constant region can be kappa. In an alternative embodiment, the Fc region of the antibody is &#x3b3;4 with a Ser228Pro mutation (Schuurman, J et. al., <i>Mol.

In such instances a human IgG4 constant domain, for example, may be used. The present invention includes anti-TIGIT antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof which comprise an IgG4 constant domain, e.g., antagonist, humanized anti-TIGIT antibodies and fragments, and methods of use thereof. In one embodiment, the IgG4 constant domain can differ from the native human IgG4 constant domain (Swiss-Prot Accession No. P01861.1) at a position corresponding to position 228 in the EU system and position 241 in the KABAT system, where the native Ser108 is replaced with Pro, in order to prevent a potential inter-chain disulfide bond between Cys106 and Cys109 (corresponding to positions Cys 226 and Cys 229 in the EU system and positions Cys 239 and Cys 242 in the KABAT system) that could interfere with proper intra-chain disulfide bond formation.

Typically, such framework modifications are made to decrease the immunogenicity of the antibody or fragment. This is usually accomplished by replacing non-CDR residues in the variable domains (i.e. framework residues) in a parental (e.g. rodent) antibody or fragment with analogous residues from the immune repertoire of the species in which the antibody is to be used, e.g. human residues in the case of human therapeutics. Such an antibody or fragment is referred to as a &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibody or fragment. In some cases it is desirable to increase the affinity, or alter the specificity of an engineered (e.g. humanized) antibody. One approach is to &#x201c;backmutate&#x201d; one or more framework residues to the corresponding germline sequence. More specifically, an antibody or fragment that has undergone somatic mutation can contain framework residues that differ from the germline sequence from which the antibody is derived. Such residues can be identified by comparing the antibody or fragment framework sequences to the germline sequences from which the antibody or fragment is derived. Another approach is to revert to the original parental (e.g., rodent) residue at one or more positions of the engineered (e.g. humanized) antibody, e.g. to restore binding affinity that may have been lost in the process of replacing the framework residues. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762, U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,530,101.)</p><p id="p-0191" num="0206">In certain embodiments, the anti-TIGIT antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof are engineered (e.g. humanized) to include modifications to in the framework and/or CDRs to improve their properties. Such engineered changes can be based on molecular modelling. A molecular model for the variable region for the parental (non-human) antibody sequence can be constructed to understand the structural features of the antibody and used to identify potential regions on the antibody that can interact with the antigen. Conventional CDRs are based on alignment of immunoglobulin sequences and identifying variable regions. Kabat et al., (1991) <i>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest</i>, Kabat, et al.; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.; 5<sup>th </sup>ed.; NIH Publ. No. 91-3242; Kabat (1978) <i>Adv. Prot. Chem. </i>32:1-75; Kabat, et al., (1977) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>252:6609-6616. Chothia and coworkers carefully examined conformations of the loops in crystal structures of antibodies and proposed hypervariable loops. Chothia, et al., (1987) <i>J Mol. Biol. </i>196:901-917 or Chothia, et al., (1989) <i>Nature </i>342:878-883. There are variations between regions classified as &#x201c;CDRs&#x201d; and &#x201c;hypervariable loops&#x201d;. Later studies (Raghunathan et al, (2012) <i>J. Mol Recog. </i>25, 3, 103-113) analyzed several antibody&#x2014;antigen crystal complexes and observed that the antigen binding regions in antibodies do not necessarily conform strictly to the &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; residues or &#x201c;hypervarible&#x201d; loops. The molecular model for the variable region of the non-human antibody can be used to guide the selection of regions that can potentially bind to the antigen. In practice the potential antigen binding regions based on model differ from the conventional &#x201c;CDR&#x201d;s or &#x201c;hyper variable&#x201d; loops. Commercial scientific software such as MOE (Chemical Computing Group) can be used for molecular modeling. Human frameworks can be selected based on best matches with the non-human sequence both in the frameworks and in the CDRs. For FR4 (framework 4) in VH, VJ regions for the human germlines are compared with the corresponding non-human region. In the case of FR4 (framework 4) in VL, J-kappa and J-Lambda regions of human germline sequences are compared with the corresponding non-human region. Once suitable human frameworks are identified, the CDRs are grafted into the selected human frameworks. In some cases certain residues in the VL-VH interface can be retained as in the non-human (parental) sequence. Molecular models can also be used for identifying residues that can potentially alter the CDR conformations and hence binding to antigen. In some cases, these residues are retained as in the non-human (parental) sequence. Molecular models can also be used to identify solvent exposed amino acids that can result in unwanted effects such as glycosylation, deamidation and oxidation. Developability filters can be introduced early on in the design stage to eliminate/minimize these potential problems.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0207">Another type of framework modification involves mutating one or more residues within the framework region, or even within one or more CDR regions, to remove T cell epitopes to thereby reduce the potential immunogenicity of the antibody. This approach is also referred to as &#x201c;deimmunization&#x201d; and is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,125,689.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0208">In particular embodiments, it will be desirable to change certain amino acids containing exposed side-chains to another amino acid residue in order to provide for greater chemical stability of the final antibody, so as to avoid deamidation or isomerization. The deamidation of asparagine may occur on NG, DG, NG, NS, NA, NT, QG or QS sequences and result in the creation of an isoaspartic acid residue that introduces a kink into the polypeptide chain and decreases its stability (isoaspartic acid effect). Isomerization can occur at DG, DS, DA or DT sequences. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the present disclosure do not contain deamidation or asparagine isomerism sites.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0209">For example, an asparagine (Asn) residue may be changed to Gln or Ala to reduce the potential for formation of isoaspartate at any Asn-Gly sequences, particularly within a CDR. A similar problem may occur at a Asp-Gly sequence. Reissner and Aswad (2003) <i>Cell. Mol. Life Sci. </i>60:1281. Isoaspartate formation may debilitate or completely abrogate binding of an antibody to its target antigen. See, Presta (2005) <i>J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. </i>116:731 at 734. In one embodiment, the asparagine is changed to glutamine (Gln). It may also be desirable to alter an amino acid adjacent to an asparagine (Asn) or glutamine (Gln) residue to reduce the likelihood of deamidation, which occurs at greater rates when small amino acids occur adjacent to asparagine or glutamine.

In addition, any methionine residues (typically solvent exposed Met) in CDRs may be changed to Lys, Leu, Ala, or Phe or other amino acids in order to reduce the possibility that the methionine sulfur would oxidize, which could reduce antigen-binding affinity and also contribute to molecular heterogeneity in the final antibody preparation.

N-linked glycoproteins contain an N-acetylglucosamine residue linked to the amide nitrogen of an asparagine residue in the protein. The predominant sugars found on glycoproteins are glucose, galactose, mannose, fucose, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and sialic acid (e.g., N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (NANA)). The processing of the sugar groups occurs co-translationally in the lumen of the ER and continues post-translationally in the Golgi apparatus for N-linked glycoproteins.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0249">N-glycans have a common pentasaccharide core of Man<sub>3</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2 </sub>(&#x201c;Man&#x201d; refers to mannose; &#x201c;Glc&#x201d; refers to glucose; and &#x201c;NAc&#x201d; refers to N-acetyl; GlcNAc refers to N-acetylglucosamine). Usually, N-glycan structures are presented with the non-reducing end to the left and the reducing end to the right. The reducing end of the N-glycan is the end that is attached to the Asn residue comprising the glycosylation site on the protein. N-glycans differ with respect to the number of branches (antennae) comprising peripheral sugars (e.g., GlcNAc, galactose, fucose and sialic acid) that are added to the Man<sub>3</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2 </sub>(&#x201c;Man3&#x201d;) core structure which is also referred to as the &#x201c;trimannose core&#x201d;, the &#x201c;pentasaccharide core&#x201d; or the &#x201c;paucimannose core&#x201d;. N-glycans are classified according to their branched constituents (e.g., high mannose, complex or hybrid). A &#x201c;high mannose&#x201d; type N-glycan has five or more mannose residues. A &#x201c;complex&#x201d; type N-glycan typically has at least one GlcNAc attached to the 1,3 mannose arm and at least one GlcNAc attached to the 1,6 mannose arm of a &#x201c;trimannose&#x201d; core. Complex N-glycans may also have galactose (&#x201c;Gal&#x201d;) or N-acetylgalactosamine (&#x201c;GalNAc&#x201d;) residues that are optionally modified with sialic acid or derivatives (e.g., &#x201c;NANA&#x201d; or &#x201c;NeuAc&#x201d;, where &#x201c;Neu&#x201d; refers to neuraminic acid and &#x201c;Ac&#x201d; refers to acetyl). Complex N-glycans may also have intrachain substitutions comprising &#x201c;bisecting&#x201d; GlcNAc and core fucose (&#x201c;Fuc&#x201d;). Complex N-glycans may also have multiple antennae on the &#x201c;trimannose core,&#x201d; often referred to as &#x201c;multiple antennary glycans.&#x201d; A &#x201c;hybrid&#x201d; N-glycan has at least one GlcNAc on the terminal of the 1,3 mannose arm of the trimannose core and zero or more mannoses on the 1,6 mannose arm of the trimannose core. The various N-glycans are also referred to as &#x201c;glycoforms.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0236" num="0250">With respect to complex N-glycans, the terms &#x201c;G-2&#x201d;, &#x201c;G-1&#x201d;, &#x201c;G0&#x201d;, &#x201c;G1&#x201d;, &#x201c;G2&#x201d;, &#x201c;A1&#x201d;, and &#x201c;A2&#x201d; mean the following. &#x201c;G-2&#x201d; refers to an N-glycan structure that can be characterized as Man<sub>3</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>; the term &#x201c;G-1&#x201d; refers to an N-glycan structure that can be characterized as GlcNAcMan<sub>3</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>; the term &#x201c;G0&#x201d; refers to an N-glycan structure that can be characterized as GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>Man<sub>3</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>; the term &#x201c;G1&#x201d; refers to an N-glycan structure that can be characterized as GalGlcNAc<sub>2</sub>Man<sub>3</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>; the term &#x201c;G2&#x201d; refers to an N-glycan structure that can be characterized as Gal<sub>2</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>Man<sub>3</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>; the term &#x201c;A1&#x201d; refers to an N-glycan structure that can be characterized as NANAGal<sub>2</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>Man<sub>3</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>; and, the term &#x201c;A2&#x201d; refers to an N-glycan structure that can be characterized as NANA<sub>2</sub>Gal<sub>2</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>Man<sub>3</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>.

When the term includes an &#x201c;F&#x201d;, the &#x201c;F&#x201d; indicates that the N-glycan species contains a fucose residue on the GlcNAc residue at the reducing end of the N-glycan. For example, G0F, G1F, G2F, A1F, and A2F all indicate that the N-glycan further includes a fucose residue attached to the GlcNAc residue at the reducing end of the N-glycan. Lower eukaryotes such as yeast and filamentous fungi do not normally produce N-glycans that produce fucose.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0251">With respect to multiantennary N-glycans, the term &#x201c;multiantennary N-glycan&#x201d; refers to N-glycans that further comprise a GlcNAc residue on the mannose residue comprising the non-reducing end of the 1,6 arm or the 1,3 arm of the N-glycan or a GlcNAc residue on each of the mannose residues comprising the non-reducing end of the 1,6 arm and the 1,3 arm of the N-glycan.

A bisected N-glycan can be characterized by the formula GlcNAc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>3</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2 </sub>wherein each mannose residue is linked at its non-reducing end to a GlcNAc residue. In contrast, when a multiantennary N-glycan is characterized as GlcNAc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>3</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, the formula indicates that two GlcNAc residues are linked to the mannose residue at the non-reducing end of one of the two arms of the N-glycans and one GlcNAc residue is linked to the mannose residue at the non-reducing end of the other arm of the N-glycan.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">Antibody Physical Properties</heading><p id="p-0239" num="0253">The antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof disclosed herein (e.g., 14A6, 28H5, 31C6 and humanized versions thereof) may further contain one or more glycosylation sites in either the light or heavy chain immunoglobulin variable region.

The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index (LD<sub>50</sub>/ED<sub>50</sub>). The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED<sub>50 </sub>with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0339">In a further embodiment, a further therapeutic agent that is administered to a subject in association with an anti-TIGIT antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention (e.g., 14A6, 28H5, 31C6) in accordance with the Physicians' Desk Reference 2003 (Thomson Healthcare; 57th edition (Nov. 1, 2002)).</p><p id="p-0330" num="0340">The mode of administration can vary. Routes of administration include oral, rectal, transmucosal, intestinal, parenteral; intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, intramedullary, intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, intraocular, inhalation, insufflation, topical, cutaneous, transdermal, or intra-arterial.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0341">In particular embodiments, the anti-TIGIT antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof of the invention (e.g., 14A6, 28H5, 31C6 and humanized versions thereof) can be administered by an invasive route such as by injection. In further embodiments of the invention, an anti-TIGIT antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, or pharmaceutical composition thereof, is administered intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intraarterially, intratumorally, or by inhalation, aerosol delivery. Administration by non-invasive routes (e.g., orally; for example, in a pill, capsule or tablet) is also within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0342">The present invention provides a vessel (e.g., a plastic or glass vial, e.g., with a cap or a chromatography column, hollow bore needle or a syringe cylinder) comprising any of the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments of the invention (e.g., 14A6, 28H5, 31C6 and humanized versions thereof) or a pharmaceutical composition thereof. The present invention also provides an injection device comprising any of the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments of the invention (e.g., 14A6, 28H5, 31C6 and humanized versions thereof) or a pharmaceutical composition thereof. An injection device is a device that introduces a substance into the body of a patient via a parenteral route, e.g., intramuscular, subcutaneous or intravenous. For example, an injection device may be a syringe (e.g., pre-filled with the pharmaceutical composition, such as an auto-injector) which, for example, includes a cylinder or barrel for holding fluid to be injected (e.g., antibody or fragment or a pharmaceutical composition thereof), a needle for piecing skin and/or blood vessels for injection of the fluid; and a plunger for pushing the fluid out of the cylinder and through the needle bore. In an embodiment of the invention, an injection device that comprises an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention or a pharmaceutical composition thereof is an intravenous (IV) injection device. Such a device includes the antibody or fragment or a pharmaceutical composition thereof in a cannula or trocar/needle which may be attached to a tube which may be attached to a bag or reservoir for holding fluid (e.g., saline; or lactated ringer solution comprising NaCl, sodium lactate, KCl, CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and optionally including glucose) introduced into the body of the patient through the cannula or trocar/needle. The antibody or fragment or a pharmaceutical composition thereof may, in an embodiment of the invention, be introduced into the device once the trocar and cannula are inserted into the vein of a subject and the trocar is removed from the inserted cannula. The IV device may, for example, be inserted into a peripheral vein (e.g., in the hand or arm); the superior vena cava or inferior vena cava, or within the right atrium of the heart (e.g., a central IV); or into a subclavian, internal jugular, or a femoral vein and, for example, advanced toward the heart until it reaches the superior vena cava or right atrium (e.g., a central venous line). In an embodiment of the invention, an injection device is an autoinjector; a jet injector or an external infusion pump. A jet injector uses a high-pressure narrow jet of liquid which penetrate the epidermis to introduce the antibody or fragment or a pharmaceutical composition thereof to a patient's body. External infusion pumps are medical devices that deliver the antibody or fragment or a pharmaceutical composition thereof into a patient's body in controlled amounts. External infusion pumps may be powered electrically or mechanically. Different pumps operate in different ways, for example, a syringe pump holds fluid in the reservoir of a syringe, and a moveable piston controls fluid delivery, an elastomeric pump holds fluid in a stretchable balloon reservoir, and pressure from the elastic walls of the balloon drives fluid delivery. In a peristaltic pump, a set of rollers pinches down on a length of flexible tubing, pushing fluid forward. In a multi-channel pump, fluids can be delivered from multiple reservoirs at multiple rates.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0343">The pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may also be administered with a needleless hypodermic injection device; such as the devices disclosed in U.S. Pat.

Such needleless devices comprising the pharmaceutical composition are also part of the present invention. The pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may also be administered by infusion. Examples of well-known implants and modules for administering the pharmaceutical compositions include those disclosed in: U.S. Pat. No. 4,487,603, which discloses an implantable micro-infusion pump for dispensing medication at a controlled rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,233, which discloses a medication infusion pump for delivering medication at a precise infusion rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,224, which discloses a variable flow implantable infusion apparatus for continuous drug delivery; U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system having multi-chamber compartments. Many other such implants, delivery systems, and modules are well known to those skilled in the art and those comprising the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0344">Alternately, one may administer the anti-TIGIT antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention (e.g., 14A6, 28H5, 31C6 or humanized versions thereof) in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the antibody or fragment directly into a tumor, e.g., a TIGIT<sup>+</sup> tumor. Furthermore, one may administer the antibody or fragment in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with a tissue-specific antibody, targeting, for example, a tumor e.g., a TIGIT<sup>+</sup> tumor, e.g., characterized by immunopathology. The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the afflicted tissue. Such methods and liposomes are part of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0345">The administration regimen depends on several factors, including the serum or tissue turnover rate of the therapeutic antibody or antigen-binding fragment, the level of symptoms, the immunogenicity of the therapeutic antibody, and the accessibility of the target cells in the biological matrix. Preferably, the administration regimen delivers sufficient therapeutic antibody or fragment to effect improvement in the target disease state, while simultaneously minimizing undesired side effects. Accordingly, the amount of biologic delivered depends in part on the particular therapeutic antibody and the severity of the condition being treated. Guidance in selecting appropriate doses of therapeutic antibodies or fragments is available (see, e.g., Wawrzynczak (1996) <i>Antibody Therapy</i>, Bios Scientific Pub. Ltd, Oxfordshire, UK; Kresina (ed.) (1991) <i>Monoclonal Antibodies, Cytokines and Arthritis</i>, Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y.; Bach (ed.)

Generally, the dose begins with an amount somewhat less than the optimum dose and it is increased by small increments thereafter until the desired or optimum effect is achieved relative to any negative side effects. Important diagnostic measures include those of symptoms of, e.g., the inflammation or level of inflammatory cytokines produced. In general, it is desirable that a biologic that will be used is derived from the same species as the animal targeted for treatment, thereby minimizing any immune response to the reagent. In the case of human subjects, for example, humanized and fully human antibodies are may be desirable.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0347">Antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof disclosed herein (e.g., 14A6, 28H5, 31C6 and humanized versions thereof) may be provided by continuous infusion, or by doses administered, e.g., daily, 1-7 times per week, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, semiannually, annually etc. Doses may be provided, e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, topically, orally, nasally, rectally, intramuscular, intracerebrally, intraspinally, or by inhalation.

An effective dose further refers to that amount of the antibody or fragment sufficient to result in at least partial amelioration of symptoms, e.g., tumor shrinkage or elimination, lack of tumor growth, increased survival time. When applied to an individual active ingredient administered alone, an effective dose refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, an effective dose refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously. An effective amount of a therapeutic will result in an improvement of a diagnostic measure or parameter by at least 10%; usually by at least 20%; preferably at least about 30%; more preferably at least 40%, and most preferably by at least 50%.

The BC4-clone 49 human T cell line is an allo-antigen specific human CD4+ T cell clone expressing a TCR specific for HLA-class II MHC molecules expressed on the EBV transformed cell line, JY (HLA-DR1,4). The BC4-clone 49 human T cell line requires re-stimulation with allo antigen every two weeks, using irradiated (5000 Rads) JY stimulator cells, irradiated PBMC (4000 Rads) isolated from two buffy coats and PHA-P (2.5 &#x3bc;g/ml; Sigma), as well as 10 ng/ml human IL-2 (R&#x26;D) supplement every 3-4 day following restimulation and expansion. Numerous T cell clones (BC1-6, BC4-27, BC4-49) were analyzed by PCR and then by flow cytometry for relative expression of TIGIT following restimulation and BC4-clone 49 was selected as it had the highest expression of TIGIT compared to other clones. The relative expression and kinetics of TIGIT, CD226, CD96 and CD155 were monitored following re-stimulation with irradiated (5000 Rads) JY stimulator cells, irradiated PBMC and PHA-P to assess the best time to assay antagonist mAbs for relative TIGIT-antagonist activity. Peak expression of TIGIT was observed at 3-4 days post restimulation, while expression of CD226 and CD96 decreased over the same time period. Expression of TIGIT then decreased, while expression of CD226 and CD96 increased again by day 6 post-restimulation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Accordingly, candidate TIGIT antagonist mAbs were assessed at 3-4 days post-restimulation. Transfectant JY overexpressing human CD155 were generated using pMX-&#x3e;huTIGIT retroviral vectors as a means to suppress BC4-clone 47 T cell responses in the primary T cell bioassay and to assess the relative capacity of anti-TIGIT mAbs to antagonize CD155 activation of TIGIT and rescue T cell proliferation and IFN&#x3b3; three days later.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0392">The primary T cell assay for relative anti-hTIGIT antagonist mAbs was set up as follows.

Before each dosing, one aliquot was thawed and diluted to nominal concentration in the appropriate diluent and dosed immediately. Aliquots of dosing solutions were snap frozen in dry ice and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. until analyses. Dosing solutions were assessed using the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD&#xae;, Rockville, Md.) platform which is based on multi-array technology; a combination of electrochemiluminescence detection and patterned arrays.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0457">Dosing Anti-TIGIT/Anti-PD1 Treatment Results:</p><p id="p-0429" num="0458">CT26 tumor-bearing BALB/cAnN mice were randomized into 10 treatment groups when the mean tumor volume of these mice reached a tumor size average of 100 mm<sup>3 </sup>(75 mm<sup>3</sup>-115 mm<sup>3</sup>): (1) muIgG1 isotype control+ rat IgG1 isotype control; (2) muIgG1 isotype control+ muIgG2a isotype control; (3) muDX400+ rat IgG1 isotype control; (4) muDX400+ muIgG2a isotype control; (5) muIgG1 isotype control+11A11; (6) muIgG1 isotype control+11A11-G1; (7) muIgG1 isotype control+11A11-G2a; (8) muDX400+11A11; (9) muDX400+11A11_G1; (10) muDX400+11A11_G2a. Animals were administered rat anti-mouse TIGIT (11A11) or chimeric anti-TIGIT antibodies 11A11-G1 or 11A11-G2a (described above) at a 20 mg/kg dose, IP, every 4 days for each of 6 cycles. An anti-mouse PD-1 (described above) was administered at a 10 mg/kg dose, IP, every 4 days for each of 6 cycles. Post dosing, animals continued to be monitored and tumor volumes were measured out to 54 days for some treatment groups. Tumors were measured twice weekly. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>. Single agent anti-TIGIT treatment using 11A11-G2a showed 52% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) at day 14; while little to no activity was observed using the 11A11 parental antibody or the 11A11-G1 antibody. For single agent anti-PD1 treatment, 40-50% TGI was observed at day 14. When combined with isotype control rat IgG1, anti-PD-1 showed 10% complete regressions (CR) by day 28, such that 1 complete response out of 10 animals was observed. The combination of anti-PD1 and parental 11A11 showed 60% TGI at day 14 and demonstrated 30% CR by day 54. The combination of anti-PD1 and 11A11-G1 showed 56% TGI at day 14 and demonstrated 30% CR by day 25. The combination of anti-PD1 and 11A11-G2a showed 94% TGI at day 14 and demonstrated 70% CR at day 42. The combination of anti-PD1 and 11A11-G2a showed greater anti-tumor activity and more complete regressions compared to combinations of anti-PD1 with 11A11 parental or 11A11-G1. There was no significant body weight loss associated with administration of single agents or combination therapy indicating that treatments were well tolerated.</p><heading id="h-0044" level="1">Example 9</heading><heading id="h-0045" level="1">Epitope Mapping of hTIGIT 14A6 Antibody by Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry</heading><p id="p-0430" num="0459">The contact areas between anti-TIGIT antibody 14A6 and human TIGIT were determined by use of hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis.
