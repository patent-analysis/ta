It is predominantly expressed on the surface of sub-endothelial cells, such as smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, and binds both zymogen coagulation Factor VII (FVII) and the activated form, Factor VIIa (FVIIa) when the integrity of the endothelium is interrupted, such as when blood vessels are severed. When TF binds FVII, it promotes FVII to FVIIa activation. TF also greatly enhances the proteolytic activity of Factor VIIa towards its physiologic substrates, Factors IX and X. FVIIa retains a zymogen-like state in solution, acting as a relatively poor enzyme. TF provides a scaffold for optimal macromolecular exosite interaction, induces conformational changes in the protease domain of FVIIa leading to maturation of its active site and orientates FVIIa on a cell surface for optimal substrate interaction. Together these effects results in an enhanced catalytic capability of FVIIa of several orders of magnitude. Hence, TF is a co-factor for FVIIa in the initiation complex of what is traditionally referred to as the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. Subsequent steps of the coagulation cascade finally result in the formation of a fibrin polymer which is bound by activated platelets and cross-linked with FXIIIa.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Platelets&#x2014;also known as thrombocytes&#x2014;derive from their cellular predecessor, megakaryocytes. Normal resting platelets freely flow throughout the blood circulation when the endothelium is intact. When the single-layered endothelial barrier is damaged, resting platelets adhere to subendothelial structures by means of glycoprotein (GP) receptors. For example, GPIaIIa and GPVI bind collagen; GPIcIIa binds fibronectin; GPIc*IIa binds laminin and GPIb-V-IX binds von Willebrand Factor (vWF) polymers. Adhesion of platelets in this manner causes them to change shape and release their alpha and dense granules. In turn, this results in the exposure of a plethora of other glycoprotein platelet receptors, such as GPIIbIIIa (which binds fibrinogen/fibrin) and TREM-like transcript 1 (TLT-1); as well as the release of coagulation factors I (fibrinogen), V and XI; other procoagulants such as ADP, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, serotonin and Platelet Factors 3/4; anti-coagulants such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI); and compounds such as platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), essential to platelet replenishment and healing. Activated platelets bind to one other and cross-link fibrin in a rapid reaction for example via the GPIIbIIIa receptor complex.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hence, activated platelets and the fibrin polymer product of the coagulation cascade together form the blood clot. Platelet aggregation of coagulation is known as the primary hemostatic response, while the coagulation cascade response is known as the secondary hemostatic response. Although fibrin is produced during the primary hemostatic response, via the so-called coagulation initiation (independent of FIX/FVIIIa), the amount produced at this point is insufficient for a strong coagel. Initial fibrin serves as an aggregater of activated platelets at site of injury, which again provides an optimal cell surface for the function of activated coagulation factors.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In subjects with a coagulopathy, such as in human beings with haemophilia A and B, various steps of the coagulation cascade are rendered dysfunctional due to, for example, the absence or insufficient presence of a coagulation factor. Such dysfunction of one part of coagulation results in insufficient blood coagulation and potentially life-threatening bleeding.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the current invention is to provide a compound that is suitable for use as a procoagulant drug in such subjects. A second object of the current invention is to provide a compound that enables a physical point of initiation of blood coagulation to be mobilised, such that extrinsic coagulation is not solely dependent on subendothelial, cell-bound tissue factor. A third object of the current invention is to provide a compound that up-regulates blood coagulation in a physiologically suitable microenvironment. A further object of the current invention is to direct a soluble tissue factor, or a biologically functional fragment or variant thereof, to the surface of activated platelets. A further object of the invention is to enhance the proteolytic activity of endogenous Factor VIIa towards its physiological substrates, Factors IX and X. Thus, the object is to enable the initiation of blood coagulation on the surface of activated platelets that are located intravascularly or extravascularly. This is in addition to the normal and exclusively subendothelial&#x2014;typically extravascular&#x2014;initiation of blood coagulation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">WO06/096828 discloses chimeric proteins that comprise soluble tissue factor (sTF) and a phosphatidyl serine (PS) binding domain, such as Annexin V. PS is exposed on the surface of activated cells, such as monocytes, endothelial cells and cells undergoing apoptosis, as well as on activated and resting platelets. The chimeric proteins are both pro-coagulant and anti-coagulant; the latter due to the fact that, in higher doses, constructs compete with coagulation factors in binding to PS on activated platelets. Thus, the chimeric proteins of WO06/096828 have a different set of properties than the fusion proteins described herein.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The current invention provides a fusion protein comprising (i) at least one tissue factor polypeptide, or biologically functional variant(s) or fragment(s) thereof, which is/are covalently attached to (ii) a ligand that is capable of binding (iii) a receptor, and/or a fragment thereof, wherein the receptor is only expressed on the surface of activated platelets.

The compositions of the present invention are based upon the identification of particular receptors and component epitopes, that appear on platelet membranes when platelets are no longer resting but in the process of being activated.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The current invention also provides the following: an isolated nucleotide sequence that encodes any fusion protein/construct according to the current invention; a vector that comprises an isolated nucleotide sequence that, in turn, encodes any fusion protein/construct according to the current invention; an isolated cell that comprises a nucleotide sequence that encodes any fusion protein/construct of the current invention. Said nucleotide sequence may, in turn, be expressed by an intracellular vector. Said isolated cell may be a eukaryotic cell, such as a mammalian cell, such as a BHK or a CHO or a HEK cell.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, the current invention provides a method of targeting tissue factor to the surface of activated platelets, said method comprising contacting activated platelets with any construct comprising (i) tissue factor, or a functional variant thereof, and (ii) a ligand that is capable of binding (iii) a receptor present on an activated platelet, such as TLT-1. In this way, the invention also relates to a method of up-regulating FX activation on the surface of activated platelets, wherein said method comprises the contacting of activated platelets with said construct in the simultaneous presence of FX.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Similarly, the invention relates to fusion proteins for use as a medicament and for use in the treatment of a coagulopathy. In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount of said construct is parenterally administered, such as intravenously or subcutaneously administered, to an individual in need thereof. Such individual in need may have any congenital, acquired and/or iatrogenic coagulopathy.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>: Human TLT-1 nucleotide (SEQ ID NO: 1) and amino acid (SEQ ID NO: 2) sequences.

Fusion proteins of the invention are capable of binding to a receptor that is only (in the sense non-ubiquitous) present on a platelet undergoing the conformational and functional changes associated with activation. Examples of such receptors might originate from the alpha- or dense granules of resting platelets. One particular example of such a receptor is TREM-like transcript 1 (TLT-1).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREMs) have a well-established role in the biology of various myeloid lineages, playing important roles in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. TLT-1 belongs to the same family of proteins, though the TLT-1 gene is expressed only in a single lineage, namely megakaryocytes and thrombocytes (platelets) and is exclusively found in the alpha-granules of megakaryocytes and platelets. TLT-1 is a transmembrane protein that is exposed on the surface of activated platelets upon alpha-granule release. To date, TLT-1 has not been found on the surface of resting platelets or on the surface of any other cell types.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The extracellular portion of TLT-1 is known to consist of a single, immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain connected to the platelet cell membrane by a linker region called the stalk (Gattis et al., Jour Biol Chem, 2006, Vol. 281, No. 19, pp. 13396-13403). The Ig-like domain of human TLT-1 (hTLT-1) consists of 105 residues and is attached to the membrane by a 37-amino acid stalk. Thus, the Ig-like domain of TLT-1 is expected to have considerable freedom of movement.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The putative transmembrane segment of hTLT-1 is 20 amino acids long. TLT-1 also has a cytoplasmic Immune-receptor Tyrosine-based Inhibitory-Motif, which may function as an intracellular signal transduction domain.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The role of TLT-1 in platelet biology has not yet been fully elucidated; it is believed that TLT-1 plays a role in regulating coagulation and inflammation at the site of an injury. A soluble form of TLT-1 containing the Ig-like domain has been reported (Gattis et al., Jour Biol Chem, 2006, Vol. 281, No. 19, pp. 13396-13403). The specific functions of soluble versus platelet-bound TLT-1 remain to be established.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">A receptor such as TLT-1 comprises epitopes that are useful targets for the fusion proteins/constructs of the current invention. Fusion proteins may bind any part of TLT-1 that would be available for binding in vivo, such as surface accessible residues of the Ig-like domain, or part of the stalk. Hence, fusion proteins may bind one or more residues within TLT-1 (20-125), TLT-1 (16-162), TLT-1 (126-162) and/or TLT-1 (129-142).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In a preferred embodiment, fusion proteins bind the stalk of TLT-1, such as one or more residues of TLT-1 (126-162) or TLT-1 (129-142). Fusion proteins that bind to the stalk of TLT-1 are unlikely to interfere with the function of the Ig-like domain and will probably not separate from the platelet surface if the Ig-like domain is shed. Furthermore, fusion proteins that bind the stalk of TLT-1 place their TF portion in a favorable position and orientation on the cell surface of activated platelets, relative to that of FVII and FVIIa. In another preferred embodiment, fusing TF to the C-terminal of an antibody, or fragment thereof, will position TF even more favourably on the cell surface of activated platelets, relative to that of FVII and FVIIa.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In terms of the current invention, TLT-1 may be from any vertebrate, such as any mammal, such as a rodent (such as a mouse, rat or guinea pig), a lagomorph (such as a rabbit), an artiodactyl (such as a pig, cow, sheep or camel) or a primate (such as a monkey or human being). TLT-1 is, preferably, human TLT-1. TLT-1 may be translated from any naturally occurring genotype or allele that gives rise to a functional TLT-1 protein. A non-limiting example of one human TLT-1 is the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO. 2.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Fusion proteins of the invention comprise a tissue factor-like component. Tissue Factor is a 263 amino acid long, integral membrane glycoprotein receptor. It consists of an extracellular part folded into two compact fibronectin type III-like domains (1-209) that are each stabilized by a single disulfide bond, a short linker (210-219), a transmembrane segment (220-242), and a short cytoplasmic tail (243-263). It forms a tight Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent complex with Factor VII/FVIIa.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In terms of the current invention, &#x201c;tissue factor, or any biologically functional variant or fragment thereof&#x201d;, may be any tissue factor-like polypeptide that is able to bind Factor VII/VIIa, such that blood coagulation is stimulated. &#x201c;Tissue factor&#x201d; may be derived from any vertebrate animal, such as any mammal, such as a rodent (such as a mouse, rat or guinea pig), a lagomorph (such as a rabbit), an artiodactyl (such as a pig, cow, sheep or camel) or a primate (such as a monkey or a human being). &#x201c;Tissue factor, or any biologically functional variant or fragment thereof&#x201d; may be the extracellular domain of human tissue factor. &#x201c;Tissue factor, or any biologically functional variant or fragment thereof&#x201d; may be any polypeptide that is at least 90%, such as at least 91%, such as at least 92%, such as at least 93%, such as at least 94%, such as at least 95%, such as at least 96%, such as at least 97%, such as at least 98%, such as at least 99% identical to the polypeptide sequence of tissue factor. &#x201c;Tissue factor, or any biologically functional variant or fragment thereof&#x201d; may be any polypeptide that is at least 90%, such as at least 91%, such as at least 92%, such as at least 93%, such as at least 94%, such as at least 95%, such as at least 96%, such as at least 97%, such as at least 98%, such as at least 99% identical to the polypeptide sequence of the extracellular domain of tissue factor or a variant thereof. &#x201c;Tissue factor, or any biologically functional variant or fragment thereof&#x201d; may be any polypeptide that is able to function as co-factor for FVII and FVIIa. Hence, &#x201c;tissue factor or any biologically functional variant or fragment thereof&#x201d; may be any polypeptide that is able to stimulate the amidolytic activity of FVIIa. Said &#x201c;tissue factor, or any biologically functional variant or fragment thereof&#x201d; may be the extracellular domain of TF (1-219). &#x201c;Tissue Factor polypeptide&#x201d; may be a polypeptide comprising the soluble extracellular domain of Tissue Factor, i.e. amino acids 1-219 (in the following referred to as sTF or sTF(1-219)), or a functional variant or truncated form thereof. Preferably, the Tissue Factor polypeptide at least comprises a fragment corresponding to the amino acid sequence 6-209 of Tissue Factor. Examples hereof are sTF(6-209), sTF(1-209), sTF (1-210), sTF (1-211), sTF (1-212), sTF (1-213), sTF (1-214), sTF (1-215), sTF (1-216), sTF (1-217), sTF (1-218), sTF(1-219), sTF(2-219), sTF(3-219), sTF(4-219), sTF(5-219).</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In accordance with the current invention, &#x201c;tissue factor, or any biologically functional variant or fragment thereof&#x201d; may have any one or more of the features listed above.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Fusion proteins of the invention also comprise a &#x201c;ligand&#x201d;. The term &#x201c;ligand&#x201d; refers to any substance that is able to bind to and form a complex with a biomolecule, in order to serve a biological purpose. In one sense of the term, it is a signal triggering molecule binding to a site on a target protein by means of intermolecular forces such as ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals forces. The association of a ligand with said biomolecule is usually reversible. Binding of a naturally occurring ligand to its counterpart receptor may or may not alter the conformation of the receptor protein. In terms of the current invention, one object of said ligand is to target the TF-like component to the surface of a platelet that is activated or in the process of being activated.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The ligand may be any naturally occurring or synthetic ligand that binds a receptor that is, preferably, only present on platelets undergoing activation. The ligand of the current invention may be any naturally occurring or synthetic ligand that binds TLT-1, or the ligand may be an antibody, or fragment thereof, that has been raised against TLT-1. The ligand of the current invention may or may not result in a change in the conformational structure of TLT-1. Furthermore, the ligand of the current invention may or may not result in intracellular signalling, as a result of binding to TLT-1. In a preferred embodiment, the ligand of the invention is capable of binding to the stalk of TLT-1. Hence, the ligand of the current invention utilises a naturally occurring receptor, or portion thereof, in order to achieve the effect that is unique to and provided by the current invention.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">As mentioned above, the ligand component of the invented fusion proteins may be an antibody or a fragment thereof. The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; as referred to herein includes whole antibodies and any antigen binding fragment (i.e., &#x201c;antigen-binding portion&#x201d;) or single chains thereof. An antibody refers to a glycoprotein comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds, or an antigen binding portion thereof. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a heavy chain constant region. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">An antibody of the invention may be a monoclonal antibody or a polyclonal antibody. In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention is a monoclonal antibody. An antibody of the invention may be a chimeric antibody, a CDR-grafted antibody, a human or humanised antibody or an antigen binding portion of any thereof. For the production of both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, the experimental animal is a suitable mammal such as a goat, rabbit, rat or mouse.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">A monoclonal antibody is, in structural terms, represented by a single molecular species having a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of the present invention can be produced by a variety of well-known techniques, including conventional monoclonal antibody methodology e.g., the standard somatic cell hybridization technique of Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature 256: 495, or viral or oncogenic transformation of B lymphocytes. The preferred animal system for preparing hybridomas is the murine system. Hybridoma production in the mouse is a very well-established procedure. Immunization protocols and techniques for isolation of immunized splenocytes for fusion are known in the art. Fusion partners (e.g., murine myeloma cells) and fusion procedures are also known.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">To generate hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies of the invention, splenocytes and/or lymph node cells from immunized mice can be isolated and fused to an appropriate immortalized cell line, such as a mouse myeloma cell line. The resulting hybridomas can be screened for the production of antigen-specific antibodies. The antibody secreting hybridomas can be replated, screened again, and if still positive for suitable IgG, the monoclonal antibodies can be subcloned at least twice by limiting dilution. The stable subclones can then be cultured in vitro to generate small amounts of antibody in tissue culture medium for characterization.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">An antibody of the invention may be prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as (a) antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic or transchromosomal for the immunoglobulin genes of interest or a hybridoma prepared therefrom, (b) antibodies isolated from a host cell transformed to express the antibody of interest, e.g., from a transfectoma, (c) antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial antibody library, and (d) antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involve splicing of immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Suitable monoclonal antibodies, shown in table 1, are herein identified by means of the prefix &#x201c;mAb&#x201d; together with a 4-digit number. Hence, the monoclonal antibody may be mAb 0012 or a variant thereof. (Note that the variable domain of the mAb referred to as &#x201c;2F105&#x201d; is identical to that of mAb 0012.)

The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo). However, the term &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0136">Such a human antibody may be a human monoclonal antibody. Such a human monoclonal antibody may be produced by a hybridoma which includes a B cell obtained from a transgenic nonhuman animal, e.g., a transgenic mouse, having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a light chain transgene fused to an immortalized cell.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0137">Human antibodies may be prepared by in vitro immunisation of human lymphocytes followed by transformation of the lymphocytes with Epstein-Barr virus.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0138">The term &#x201c;human antibody derivatives&#x201d; refers to any modified form of the human antibody, e.g., a conjugate of the antibody and another agent or antibody.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0139">The term &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d; is intended to refer to antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences. Additional framework region modifications may be made within the human framework sequences.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0140">Antibodies of the invention can be tested for binding to the target protein by, for example, standard ELISA or Western blotting. An ELISA assay can also be used to screen for hybridomas that show positive reactivity with the target protein. The binding specificity of an antibody may also be determined by monitoring binding of the antibody to cells expressing the target protein, for example, by flow cytometry.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0141">The specificity of an antibody of the invention for the target protein may be further studied by determining whether or not the antibody binds to other proteins. For example, where it is desired to produce an antibody that specifically binds TLT-1 or a particular part, e.g. epitope, of TLT-1, the specificity of the antibody may be assessed by determining whether or not the antibody also binds to other molecules or modified forms of TLT-1 that lack the part of interest.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0142">Polypeptide or antibody &#x201c;fragments&#x201d; according to the invention may be made by truncation, e.g. by removal of one or more amino acids from the N and/or C-terminal ends of a polypeptide. Up to 10, up to 20, up to 30, up to 40 or more amino acids may be removed from the N and/or C terminal in this way. Fragments may also be generated by one or more internal deletions.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0143">An antibody of the invention may be, or may comprise, a fragment of the anti-TLT-1 antibody or a variant thereof. The antibody of the invention may be or may comprise an antigen binding portion of this antibody or a variant thereof, as discussed further above. For example, the antibody of the invention may be a Fab fragment of this antibody, or a variant thereof, or may be a single chain antibody derived from this antibody, or a variant thereof.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0144">Antibodies, as well as fusion proteins that comprise an antibody, or fragment thereof, may be defined in terms of their epitopes and/or paratopes. The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin (or T-cell receptor). Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. An epitope having antigenic activity is a portion of a polypeptide to which an antibody immunospecifically binds, as determined by any method well known in the art, for example, by immunoassays. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0145">In terms of the current invention, &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; refers to the area or region on an antigen (Ag), which is a receptor on an activated platelet, to which the antibody (Ab) portion of the fusion protein is capable of specifically binding, i.e. the area or region that is in physical contact with the Ab. An antigen's epitope may comprise amino acid residues in the Ag that are directly involved in binding to a Ab (the immunodominant component of the epitope) and other amino acid residues, which are not directly involved in the binding, such as amino acid residues of the Ag which are effectively blocked by the Ab (in other words, the amino acid residue is within the &#x201c;solvent-excluded surface&#x201d; and/or the &#x201c;footprint&#x201d; of the Ab). The term epitope herein includes both types of binding sites in any particular region of a receptor such as TLT-1 that specifically binds to an anti-TLT-1 antibody, or another TLT-1-specific agent according to the invention, unless otherwise stated (e.g., in some contexts the invention relates to antibodies that bind directly to particular amino acid residues). Receptors such as TLT-1 may comprise a number of different epitopes, which may include, without limitation, (1) linear peptide antigenic determinants, (2) conformational antigenic determinants which consist of one or more non-contiguous amino acids located near each other in the mature receptor conformation; and (3) post-translational antigenic determinants which consist, either in whole or part, of molecular structures covalently attached to TLT-1, such as carbohydrate groups.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0146">The epitope for a given antibody (Ab)/antigen (Ag) pair can be defined and characterized at different levels of detail using a variety of experimental and computational epitope mapping methods. The experimental methods include mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Hydrogen deuterium eXchange Mass Spectrometry (HX-MS) and various competition binding methods. As each method relies on a unique principle, the description of an epitope is intimately linked to the method by which it has been determined. Thus, the epitope for a given Ab/Ag pair will be defined differently depending on the epitope mapping method employed.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0147">At its most detailed level, the epitope for the interaction between the Ag and the Ab can be defined by the spatial coordinates defining the atomic contacts present in the Ag-Ab interaction, as well as information about their relative contributions to the binding thermodynamics. At a less detailed level the epitope can be characterized by the spatial coordinates defining the atomic contacts between the Ag and Ab. At a further less detailed level the epitope can be characterized by the amino acid residues that it comprises as defined by a specific criterium, e.g. distance between atoms in the Ab and the Ag. At a further less detailed level the epitope can be characterized through function, e.g. by competition binding with other Abs. The epitope can also be defined more generically as comprising amino acid residues for which substitution by another amino acid will alter the characteristics of the interaction between the Ab and Ag.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0148">In the context of an X-ray derived crystal structure defined by spatial coordinates of a complex between an Ab, e.g. a Fab fragment, and its Ag, the term epitope is herein, unless otherwise specified or contradicted by context, specifically defined as platelet receptor residues characterized by having a heavy atom (i.e. a non-hydrogen atom) within a distance of 4 &#x212b; from a heavy atom in the Ab.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0149">From the fact that descriptions and definitions of epitopes, dependent on the epitope mapping method used, are obtained at different levels of detail, it follows that comparison of epitopes for different Abs on the same Ag can similarly be conducted at different levels of detail.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0150">Epitopes described on the amino acid level, e.g. determined from an X-ray structure, are said to be identical if they contain the same set of amino acid residues. Epitopes are said to overlap if at least one amino acid is shared by the epitopes. Epitopes are said to be separate (unique) if no amino acid residue is shared by the epitopes.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0151">Epitopes characterized by competition binding are said to be overlapping if the binding of the corresponding Ab's are mutually exclusive, i.e. if binding of one Ab excludes simultaneous binding of the other Ab. The epitopes are said to be separate (unique) if the Ag is able to accommodate binding of both corresponding Ab's simultaneously. Thus, fusion proteins of the invention may be capable of binding to the same epitope as mAb 0012. Fusion proteins may be capable of binding to the same epitope as mAb 0023. Fusion proteins may be capable of binding to the same epitope as mAb 0051. Fusion proteins may be capable of binding to the same epitope as mAb 0061. Fusion proteins may be capable of binding to the same epitope as mAb 0062.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0152">The epitope may comprise one or more residues selected from the group consisting of K133, I134, G135, S136, L137, A138, N140, A141, F142, 5143, D144, P145 and A146 of SEQ ID NO: 4.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0153">The epitope may comprise one or more residues selected from the group consisting of V17, Q18, C19, H20, Y21, R22, L23, Q24, D25, V26, K27, A28, L63, G64, G65, G66, L67, L68, G89, A90, R91, G92, P93, Q94, I95 and L96 of SEQ ID NO: 5.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0154">The epitope may comprise one or more residues selected from the group consisting of L36, P37, E38, G39, C40, Q41, P42, L43, V44, S45, S46, A47, V73, T74, L75, Q76, E77, E78, D79, A80, G81, E82, Y83, G84, C85, M86, R91, G92, P93, Q94, I95, L96, H97, R98, V99, S100 and L101 of SEQ ID NO: 5.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0155">The epitope may comprise one or more residues selected from the group consisting of V17, Q18, C19, H20, Y21, R22, L23, Q24, D25, V26, K27, A28, R91, G92, P93, Q94, I95, L96, H97, R98, V99, S100 and L101 of SEQ ID NO: 5.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0156">The epitope may comprise one or more residues selected from the group consisting of E5, T6, H7, K8, I9, G10, S11, L12, A13, E14, N15, A16, F17, S18, D19, P20 and A21 of SEQ ID NO: 7.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0157">The epitope may comprise one or more residues selected from the group consisting of K133, I134, G135, S136, L137, A138, N140, A141, F142, S143, D144, P145 and A146 of SEQ ID NO: 7.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0158">The definition of the term &#x201c;paratope&#x201d; is derived from the above definition of &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; by reversing the perspective. Thus, the term &#x201c;paratope&#x201d; refers to the area or region on the Ab to which an Ag specifically binds, i.e. to which it makes physical contact to the Ag.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0159">The paratope may comprise one or more residues selected from the group consisting of H50, N52, Y56, H58, Y73, F79, S115, T116, V118 and Y120 of the anti-TLT-1 light (L) chain (SEQ ID NO: 40), and residues V20, F45, R49, Y50, W51, E68, T75, N77, S116, G117, V118 and T120 of the anti-TLT-1 heavy (H) chain (SEQ ID NO: 39)</p><p id="p-0163" num="0160">In the context of an X-ray derived crystal structure defined by spatial coordinates of a complex between an Ab, e.g. a Fab fragment, and its Ag, the term paratope is herein, unless otherwise specified or contradicted by context, specifically defined as Ag residues characterized by having a heavy atom (i.e. a non-hydrogen atom) within a distance of 4 &#x212b; from a heavy atom in the platelet receptor.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0161">The epitope and paratope for a given antibody (Ab)/antigen (Ag) pair may be identified by routine methods. For example, the general location of an epitope may be determined by assessing the ability of an antibody to bind to different fragments or variants of TLT-1. The specific amino acids within TLT-1 that make contact with an antibody (epitope) and the specific amino acids in an antibody that make contact with TLT-1 (paratope) may also be determined using routine methods, such as those described in the examples. For example, the antibody and target molecule may be combined and the Ab/Ag complex may be crystallised. The crystal structure of the complex may be determined and used to identify specific sites of interaction between the antibody and its target.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0162">Fusion proteins comprising a ligand that is an antibody or fragment thereof may also be defined in terms of their complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). The term &#x201c;complementarity-determining region&#x201d; or &#x201c;hypervariable region&#x201d; when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody that are responsible for antigen binding. The complementarity-determining regions or &#x201c;CDRs&#x201d; are generally comprised of amino acid residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light-chain variable domain and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy-chain variable domain; (Kabat et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242) and/or those residues from a &#x201c;hypervariable loop&#x201d; (residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light-chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy-chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk, 3. Mol. Biol 1987; 196:901-917). Typically, the numbering of amino acid residues in this region is performed by the method described in Kabat et al., supra. Phrases such as &#x201c;Kabat position&#x201d;, &#x201c;Kabat residue&#x201d;, and &#x201c;according to Kabat&#x201d; herein refer to this numbering system for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains. Using the Kabat numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence of a peptide may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include amino acid insertions (residue 52a, 52b and 52c according to Kabat) after residue 52 of CDR H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy chain FR residue 82.

When part (ii) of the fusion protein is capable of binding the immunoglobulin-like domain, a longer linker may allow part (i) of said fusion protein to adapt a functionally relevant position and orientation on the surface of the activated platelet, thereby facilitating its function. This is because part (i), i.e. the TF polypeptide, must be in the special vicinity of and properly oriented relative to FVII/FVIIa: TF acts as co-factor to FVII/FVIIa, which binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phospholipid on the surface of activated platelets.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0245">A fusion protein that is capable of binding the stalk of TLT-1 is adjacent to the platelet membrane.

Binding affinity may be quantified by determining the binding constant (K<sub>D</sub>) for an antibody component and its target. Similarly, the specificity of binding of an antibody component to its target may be defined in terms of the comparative binding constants (K<sub>D</sub>) of the antibody for its target as compared to the binding constant with respect to the antibody and another, non-target molecule.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0266">Typically, the K<sub>D </sub>for the antibody with respect to the target will be 2-fold, preferably 5-fold, more preferably 10-fold less than K<sub>D </sub>with respect to the other, non-target molecule such as unrelated material or accompanying material in the environment.

Likewise, the term &#x201c;aqueous solution&#x201d; is defined as a solution comprising at least 50% w/w water, and the term &#x201c;aqueous suspension&#x201d; is defined as a suspension comprising at least 50% w/w water.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0293">In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation is a freeze-dried formulation, to which the physician or the patient adds solvents and/or diluents prior to use.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0294">In a further aspect, the pharmaceutical formulation comprises an aqueous solution of such an antibody, and a buffer, wherein the antibody is present in a concentration from 1 mg/ml or above, and wherein said formulation has a pH from about 2.0 to about 10.0.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0295">The term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to the medical therapy of any human or other animal subject in need thereof. Said subject is expected to have undergone physical examination by a [veterinary] medical practitioner, who has given a tentative or definitive diagnosis which would indicate that the use of said specific treatment is beneficial to the health of said human or other animal subject. The timing and purpose of said treatment may vary from one individual to another, according to the status quo of the subject's health. Thus, said treatment may be prophylactic, palliative, symptomatic and/or curative.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0296">In terms of the present invention, prophylactic, palliative, symptomatic and/or curative treatments may represent separate aspects of the invention.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0297">A coagulopathy that results in an increased haemorrhagic tendency may be caused by any qualitative or quantitative deficiency of any pro-coagulative component of the normal coagulation cascade or any upregulation of fibrinolysis. Such coagulopathies may be congenital and/or acquired and/or iatrogenic and are identified by a person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0298">Non-limiting examples of congenital hypocoagulopathies are haemophilia A, haemophilia B, Factor VII deficiency, Factor X deficiency, Factor XI deficiency, von Willebrand's disease and thrombocytopenias such as Glanzmann's thombasthenia and Bernard-Soulier syndrome.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0299">A non-limiting example of an acquired coagulopathy is serine protease deficiency caused by vitamin K deficiency; such vitamin K-deficiency may be caused by administration of a vitamin K antagonist, such as warfarin. Acquired coagulopathy may also occur following extensive trauma. In this case otherwise known as the &#x201c;bloody vicious cycle&#x201d;, it is characterised by haemodilution (dilutional thrombocytopaenia and dilution of clotting factors), hypothermia, consumption of clotting factors and metabolic derangements (acidosis). Fluid therapy and increased fibrinolysis may exaserbate this situation. Said haemorrhage may be from any part of the body.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0300">Haemophilia A with &#x201c;inhibitors&#x201d; (that is, allo-antibodies against factor VIII) and haemophilia B with &#x201c;inhibitors&#x201d; (that is, allo-antibodies against factor IX) are non-limiting examples of coagulopathies that are partly congenital and partly acquired.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0301">A non-limiting example of an iatrogenic coagulopathy is an overdosage of anticoagulant medication&#x2014;such as heparin, aspirin, warfarin and other platelet aggregation inhibitors&#x2014;that may be prescribed to treat thromboembolic disease. A second, non-limiting example of latrogenic coagulopathy is that which is induced by excessive and/or inappropriate fluid therapy, such as that which may be induced by a blood transfusion.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0302">In one embodiment of the current invention, haemorrhage is associated with haemophilia A or B. In another embodiment, haemorrhage is associated with haemophilia A or B with acquired inhibitors. In another embodiment, haemorrhage is associated with von Willebrand's disease. In another embodiment, haemorrhage is associated with severe tissue damage. In another embodiment, haemorrhage is associated with severe trauma. In another embodiment, haemorrhage is associated with surgery. In another embodiment, haemorrhage is associated with haemorrhagic gastritis and/or enteritis. In another embodiment, the haemorrhage is profuse uterine bleeding, such as in placental abruption. In another embodiment, haemorrhage occurs in organs with a limited possibility for mechanical haemostasis, such as intracranially, intraaurally or intraocularly. In another embodiment, haemorrhage is associated with anticoagulant therapy.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0303">In a further embodiment, haemorrhage may be associated with thrombocytopaenia.

The HindIII- and EcoRI digested PCR fragment was inserted into the HindIII- and EcoRI sites of a pTT-based expression vector. The pTT vector is essentially described in Durocher, Y. et al., (2002) Nucleic Acid Res, 30: E9. The resulting expression plasmid was designated pTT-hTLT-1 ECD-His. pTT-hTLT-1 ECD-His was transfected into HEK293-6E suspension cells in order to transiently express hTLT-1 ECD-His. HEK293-6E cells were grown in FREESTYLE HEK293 MEDIUM (animal origin-free, chemically defined, protein-free medium)(GIBCO, cat. no. 12338-018) supplemented with 1% P/S (GIBCO cat. no. 15140-122), 0.1% PLURONIC (clock copolymers based on ethylene oxide and propylene oxide) (GIBCO, cat. no. 24040-032) and 25 ug/mL GENETICIN (aminoglycoside selective agent) (GIBCO, cat. no. 10131-019) and cells were transfected at a cell density of 1 mill/mL using 293FECTIN (cationic lipid-based formulation for transfecting DNA into eukaryotic cells) (Invitrogen, cat. no. 12347-019). For each liter of HEK293-6E cells, the transfection was performed by diluting 1 mg of pTT-hTLT-1 ECD-His DNA into 30 mL OPTIMEM (reduced-serum media) (dilution A) and by diluting 1 mL 293FECTIN (cationic lipid-based formulation for transfecting DNA into eukaryotic cells) into 30 mL OPTIMEM (reduced-serum media) (GIBCO, cat. no. 51985-026, dilution B). Dilution A and B were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The transfection mix was hereafter added to the HEK293-6E cells and cells were incubated at 37&#xb0; C. in a humified incubator with orbital rotation (125 rpm). Seven days post-transfection, cells were removed by centrifugation and the resulting hTLT-1 ECD-His containing supernatants were sterile-filtrated prior to purification.</p><heading id="h-0100" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0347" num="0516">Purification and Characterisation of hTLT1 ECD-His Protein.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0517">Purification of the hTLT1 ECD-His protein was conducted as a 2-step process composed of 1) His-affinity chromatography using the Cobalt-loaded resin TALON (Clontech, cat. no. 635506) and 2) anion-exchange chromatography using the fine-particle resin Source 15Q (GE Healthcare, cat. no. 17-0947). The purifications were conducted using an &#xc4;ktaExplorer chromatography system (GE Healthcare, cat. no. 18-1112-41). The buffer systems used for the first purification step was an equilibration buffer composed of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, a wash buffer composed of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.5 M NaCl and an elution buffer composed of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mM Imidazole. The cell supernatant was applied directly without any adjustments onto a pre-equilibrated TALON column. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of equilibration buffer, 20 column volumes of wash buffer and last with 20 column volumes of equilibration buffer. The protein was eluted isocratically in approx. 5 column volumes of elution buffer. The molecular mass of the eluted protein was ana-lysed using SDS-PAGE/Coomassie NUPAGE (Bis-Tris gel) 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, cat. no. NP0321BOX) and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) setup on a Micro-flex system (Bruker Daltonics). Here, two distinct protein masses were observed of approx. 16.7 and 33.4 kDa of almost equal amounts. The observed masses corresponded to monomer and dimer forms of hTLT1 ECD-His. Reducing the protein resulted in complete abolishment of the 33.4 kDa protein, while intensifying the 16.7 kDa protein as judged from a SDS-PAGE/Coomassie analysis. Thus, the hTLT-1 ECD-His protein contained an interlinked C-C dimer. To segregate monomer from dimer, a second purification step was employed. The buffer systems used for this purification step was an equilibration buffer composed of 50 mM Hepes, pH 8.0 and an elution buffer composed of 50 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl. The sample was adjusted to a pH of 8.0 using 1 M NaOH and then diluted to a conductivity of approx. 10 mS/cm. The protein was applied to a pre-equilibrated Source 15Q column, washed with 5 column volumes of equilibration and eluted using 0-100% elution buffer over 20 column volumes. Based on UV280 monitoring, two peaks were apparent with almost base-line separa-tion. Analyzing fractions over the two peaks using SDS-PAGE/Coomassie, MALDI-TOF MS and Dynamic Light-Scattering (DLS) using a Dynapro instrument (Wyatt Technology) analyses showed the presence of monomer hTLT-1 ECD-His protein in the peak eluting first and Cys-Cys dimer in the peak eluting second. A pool was prepared containing the monomer hTLT-1 ECD-His protein only. The final protein integrity was analyzed based on a Size-Exclusion High-Performance Liquid Chromatographic (SEC-HPLC) method setup on an Agilent LC 1100/1200 system and using a BIOSEP (column for separation biomolecules)-SEC-S3000 300&#xd7;7.8 mm column (Phenomenex, cat. no. 00H-2146-K0) and a running buffer composed of 200 mM NaPhosphate pH 6.9, 300 mM NaCl and 10% isopropanol. The protein eluted as a single symmetric peak at a retention time of approx. 9.9 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0518">A batch of hTLT-1 ECD-His was prepared for an immunization study for production of monoclonal anti-TLT1 antibodies.

To measure the final protein concentration, a NANODROP spectropho-tometer (Thermo Scientific) was used together with an extinction coefficient of 0.55.</p><heading id="h-0101" level="1">Example 3</heading><p id="p-0350" num="0519">Preparation of Monoclonal TLT-1 Antibodies.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0520">RBF mice were immunized by injecting 50 &#x3bc;g of hTLT-1 ECD-His.

by a 2-step process composed of affinity chromatography using a Protein A MABSELECT SURE resin (GE Healthcare, cat. no. 17-5438-01) and gel filtration chromatography using a 26/60 SUPERDEX 200 (prep grade gel filtration medium) PrepGrade col-umn (GE Healthcare, cat no. 17-1071-01). Purifications were conducted using an &#xc4;ktaExplorer chromatography system (GE Healthcare, cat. no. 18-1112-41). The buffer systems used for the affinity purification step was an equilibration buffer composed of 20 mM NaPhosphate pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, an elution buffer composed of 10 mM Formic acid pH 3.5 and an pH-adjustment buffer composed of 0.5 M NaPhosphate pH 9.0. Cell supernatants were applied directly without any adjustments onto a pre-equilibrated MABSELECT SURE column. The column was washed with 15 column volumes of equilibration buffer and the monoclonal antibodies were eluted isocratically in approx. 2-5 column volume of elution buffer. The pooled fractions were adjusted to neutral pH using the described pH-adjustment buffer immediately after elution. The protein was further purified and buffer exchanged using said gel filtration column. The running buffer used for size exclusion chromatography was a 25 mM His pH 6.5, 135 mM NaCl. The flow rate used was 2.5 ml/min and the monoclonal anti-TLT1 antibodies eluted as single peaks at approx. 0.4 column volumes. Based on analyses of fractions over the entire peak using the previously described SEC-HPLC method (as described in example 2), pools were prepared which contained pure antibody protein eluting as symmetric peaks at approx. 8.5 min. and with a minimum content of earlier eluting high-molecular weight protein. The purified antibodies were characterized using the previously described SDS-PAGE/Coomassie (as described in example 2) and SEC-HPLC methods, showing that all antibody protein preparations produced were highly homogenous. All antibodies displayed expected heavy chain components of approx. 50 kDa and light chain components of approx. 25 kDa when using reducing conditions prior to running the SDS-PAGE/Coomassie analyses. Intact molecular mass determinations were performed using a Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Ionisation Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry method setup on an Agilent 6210 instrument and a desalting column MassPREP (Waters, cat. no. USRM10008656). The buffer system used was an equilibration buffer composed of 0.1% Formic acid in LC-MS graded-H<sub>2</sub>O and an elution buffer composed of 0.1% Formic acid in LC-MS graded-ACN. All antibodies displayed intact molecular masses of 147.2-148.6 kDa, which is approx. 2.7-3.1 kDa above the theoretical masses of the amino acid sequences for each of the antibodies. Thus, all the recombinantly expressed anti-TLT-1 antibodies displayed post-translational modifications corresponding to expected HC N-glycosylations. Final purities of 95-99% were obtained for the six antibodies. To verify the N-terminal sequence of the cloned and purified anti-TLT-1 antibodies, EDMAN degradations were performed using an automated sequenator system (Applied Biosystems 494 Protein Sequencer). 10-20 degradation cycles were conducted for each antibody. Here, expected light and heavy chain sequences were confirmed for the six cloned anti-TLT-1 antibodies. To measure the final protein concentrations, a NANODROP spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) was used together with specific extinction coefficients for each of the six antibodies ranging from 1.34-1.51.</p><heading id="h-0127" level="1">Example 29</heading><p id="p-0415" num="0582">Purification and Characterization of Recombinantly Expressed Fab-hTF.1-219 Proteins.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0583">Purification of the Fab-hTF.1-219 fusion proteins outlined in table 6 was conducted using a 2-step process composed of affinity chromatography using an anti-HPC4 resin (Roche, cat. no. 11815024001) and a final buffer shift. The purification was conducted using an &#xc4;ktaExplorer chromatography system (GE Healthcare, cat. no. 18-1112-41).

The column was washed with 5 column volumes of equilibration buffer, 5 column volumes of wash buffer and last with 5 column volumes of equilibration buffer. The Fab-hTF1-219 proteins were eluted isocratically in approx. 4 column volumes of elution buffer. The Fab-hTF1-219 proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE/Coomassie, SEC-HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS analyses as described previously (as described in examples 1 and 28), showing that pure and homogenous proteins with molecular masses of 78-86 kDa were obtained. Since the theoretical masses of the amino acid sequence for the Fab-hTF1-219 constructs were 73-77 kDa, all the expressed proteins contained post-translational modifications.

The purifications were conducted using an &#xc4;ktaExplorer chromatography system (GE Healthcare, cat. no. 18-1112-41). The buffer systems used for the first purification step was an equilibration buffer composed of 50 mM Tris, pH7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, and an elution buffer composed of 50 mM Tris, pH7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM Imidazole. The cell supernatant was adjusted with 10 mM Imidazole final concentration and a pH of 7.5 and applied onto a pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA column. The column was washed with 4 column volumes of 2% elution buffer. The protein was eluted isocratically in approx. 4 column volumes of 60% elution buffer. The main peak based on UV280 monitoring was collected and pooled. In the second step, the protein was prepared for anion-exchange chromatograph by shifting into 50 mM Tris, pH7.5 buffer using a desalting column. The buffer system used for the third purification step was an equilibration buffer composed of 50 mM Tris, pH7.5, and an elution buffer composed of 50 mM Tris, pH7.5, 1M NaCl.

The pool of protein from step 3 was directly applied to HiLoad 16/60 SUPERDEX 200 (prep grade gel filtration medium) column. The main peak was collected and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. SDS-PAGE/Coomassie 8-15% analysis, SEC-HPLC and LC-MS showed that a pure protein was obtained. One dense protein band was observed from the SDS-PAGE/Coomassie analysis which corresponded to said heterodimer protein complex. Reducing the protein resulted in complete abolishment of the protein complex band, while appearance of three bands indicating three subunits of the protein complex. The final protein integrity was analyzed based on a SEC-HPLC method set up on a Waters LC 2795/2996 system and using a BIOSEP (column for separation biomolecules)-SEC-S3000 300&#xd7;7.8 mm column (Phenomenex, cat. no. 00H-2146-K0) and a running buffer composed of PBS.

The effect was compared with the stimulation induced by soluble TF (sTF), identical to hTF.1-219. Binding of TF to FVIIa results in a marked increase in FVIIa catalytic activity; and binding of sTF and the TF-construct was conveniently measured using FVIIa's amidolytic activity with the chromogenic substrate S2288 (Ile-Pro-Arg-pNA). Binding of hTF.1-219 to FVIIa increases the FVIIa catalytic activity. The TF-fusion proteins were designed to locate FVII/FVIIa to the surface of activated platelets. Fusion of a protein to TF should therefore not significantly affect its binding to FVIIa, and one will expect the concentration-dependent stimulation of FVIIa activity induced by TF-fusion proteins under optimal conditions to be identical to that obtained with the non-fused TF (hTF.1-219). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> TF-fusion proteins were tested in an assay with 50 nM FVIIa, 50 mM Hepes, 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mg/ml BSA pH 7.4 and various concentrations (0-100 nM) of sTF (open square) or Fab-TF-fusion proteins (open symbols) or mAb-TF-fusion proteins (closed symbols). FVIIa amidolytic activity was measured with 1 mM of the chromogenic substrate S2288. The FVIIa activity was measured by the increase in absorbance at 405 nm at room temperature and the reaction was started by addition of 1 mM S2288. Fab-hTF.1-219-fusion proteins stimulate FVIIa amidolytic activity in a concentration dependent manner indistinguishable from that induced by hTF.1-219 showing that these construct bind to FVIIa with a 1:1 stoichiometry and with a similar affinity as hTF.1-219. The mAb-hTF.1-219-fusion proteins similarly stimulate FVIIa activity in a concentration dependent manner identical to that of hTF.1-219. However, in this case the stoichiometry indicates that these construct bind two FVIIa per mAb as expected with free access to both TF moieties on the mAb-TF-fusion proteins.</p><heading id="h-0132" level="1">Example 34</heading><p id="p-0426" num="0593">mAb Binding and Competition of Different mABs for Binding to TLT-1.</p><heading id="h-0133" level="2">Materials:</heading><p id="p-0427" num="0594"></p><p id="p-0428" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00008" num="00008"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 8</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Reagents</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="133pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Reagent</entry><entry>Source</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>TLT1</entry><entry>NN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>mAb0061</entry><entry>NN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>mAb0023</entry><entry>NN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>mAb0051</entry><entry>NN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>mAb0062</entry><entry>NN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>All other reagents</entry><entry>Biacore</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Human Antibody Capture</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Kit (BR-1008-39)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0134" level="2">Method:</heading><p id="p-0429" num="0595">The mAbs of interest were either immobilized directly to a CM5 chip or by capture via a human Fc capture mAb immobilized to a CM5 chip.

This was shown with the TF-fusion proteins 0128 and 0129 produced by fusion of TF with the AP3 Fab fragment The AP3-Fab was directed towards the GPIIbIIIa receptor which is present on the surface of both activated and resting platelets (Phillips, D. R., and Agin, P. P. (1977) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>252, 2121-226). The 0128 Fab-hTF.1-219 and 0129 Fab-hTF.1-219 TF-fusion proteins strongly stimulated the response on activated platelets. However, the response with resting platelets is about 20% of the response with activated platelets under conditions where, in comparison, the response induced by the TLT-1 targeting TF-fusion protein, 0020 Fab-hTF.1-219, with resting platelets is 8% of the response with activated platelets. It is conceivable that the stimulation pattern obtained with TF-fusion proteins is a result of three major factors: i) platelet receptor density and relative surface exposure on resting and activated platelets, ii) surface exposure of acidic phospholipids and iii) a minimum of spontaneous platelet activation during the preparation of washed, resting platelets. The presence of GPIIbIIIa receptor on the surface of resting platelets might account for a relatively high activity of the AP3 TF-fusion proteins on resting platelets. Fusion proteins based on antibodies to platelet receptors of crucial importance to haemostasis like GPIIbIIIa are also likely to possess antagonistic properties and serve as anti-coagulants at high concentrations.</p><heading id="h-0146" level="1">Example 42</heading><p id="p-0497" num="0661">TF-Fusion Proteins Promotes Fibrin Clot Formation in Hemophilia-Like Whole Blood.</p><p id="p-0498" num="0662">Hemophilia-like conditions were obtained by incubation of normal citrate-stabilized human whole blood (HWB) with 10 &#x3bc;g/ml anti-FVIII antibody (Sheep anti-Human Factor VIII; Hematologic Technologies Inc) for 30 min at room temp.

Walk.</p><p id="p-0567" num="0725">The peptide walking ELISA defined the minimal binding region of the peptide. This was established by coating biotinylated peptides with one residue frameshift in the stalk region of TLT-1 in streptavidin plates followed by binding of the antibody of interest (mAb 0061). A secondary antibody was added for detection and binding was measured at 450 nm. Positive control: binding to biotinylated TLT-1.</p><heading id="h-0160" level="2">Materials</heading><p id="p-0568" num="0000"><ul id="ul0093" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0093-0001" num="0726">10&#xd7;PBS: 10&#xd7;GPBS 14200 Gibco</li>    <li id="ul0093-0002" num="0727">TWEEN (polysorbate surfactant)20:Aldrich Cat#27,434-8, Lot#S30950-315</li>    <li id="ul0093-0003" num="0728">Plate: 96-well Streptavidin coated plate Nunc#466014</li>    <li id="ul0093-0004" num="0729">BSA: A7030-100 g Lot#057K0737</li>    <li id="ul0093-0005" num="0730">Blocking/Dilute Buffer: 1&#xd7;PBS pH=7.4    <ul id="ul0094" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0094-0001" num="0731">2% BSA</li>        <li id="ul0094-0002" num="0732">0.5% TWEEN (polysorbate surfactant)20</li>    </ul>    </li>    <li id="ul0093-0006" num="0733">Wash Buffer: 1&#xd7;PBS+0.5% TWEEN (polysorbate surfactant)20</li>    <li id="ul0093-0007" num="0734">Standard: Biotinylated TLT-1 04/09-08 1 mg/ml</li>    <li id="ul0093-0008" num="0735">mAb: 0197-0000-0061-4A-0.55 mg/ml</li>    <li id="ul0093-0009" num="0736">Detecting Ab: Goat anti-Human IgG HRP-labeled 1 mg/ml Prod. no.

Solutions of 0.3M Fmoc-protected amino acids in 0.3 M 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) were coupled using diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) for 1-4 hours. As solid support the Rink amide LL resin (Merck) was used in a 96 microtiter filterplate (Nunc) and ca. 20 mg resin pr well was used. The synthesis was performed using the Multipep RS peptide synthesiser from Intavis, Germany and manufacture protocol was used. The removal of Fmoc was done using 25% piperidin in NMP. All peptides were coupled with biotin at the N-terminal and 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid was used as a spacer between biotin and the peptides. This spacer was also coupled as a Fmoc-protected building block according to the synthesis protocol (IRIS biotech, Germany)</p><heading id="h-0166" level="2">Final Deprotection and Workup</heading><p id="p-0577" num="0747">The final deprotection was done using 90% trifluoracetic acid (TFA), 5% triisopropylsilane and 5% H2O for 3 hours. A total of 1 ml TFA was used pr well. The TFA was filtered to 96 deep well (Nunc) and the TFA was reduced in volume by evaporation to ca. 100-200 ul pr well and diethylether was added to all wells in order to precipitate the peptides. The suspension of peptide in diethylether was transferred to solvent 96 well filter plate (0.47 um, Millipore) and the peptides were washed twice with diethylether and dried. The peptides were redissolved in 80% DMSO and 20% water giving a stock solution of ca. 1-3 mg/ml.</p><p id="p-0578" num="0748">Biotinylated 20mer peptides from stalk region of TLT-1 (SEQ ID NO
