In vitro experiments have shown that adding PCSK9 to HepG2 cells lowers the levels of cell surface LDLR (Benjannet et al., 2004; Lagace et al., 2006; Maxwell et al., 2005; Park et al., 2004). Experiments with mice have shown that increasing PCSK9 protein levels decreases levels of LDLR protein in the liver (Benjannet et al., 2004; Lagace et al., 2006; Maxwell et al., 2005; Park et al., 2004), while PCSK9 knockout mice have increased levels of LDLR in the liver (Rashid et al., 2005). Additionally, various human PCSK9 mutations that result in either increased or decreased levels of plasma LDL have been identified (Kotowski et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2006). PCSK9 has been shown to directly interact with the LDLR protein, be endocytosed along with the LDLR, and co-immunofluoresce with the LDLR throughout the endosomal pathway (Lagace et al., 2006). Degradation of the LDLR by PCSK9 has not been observed and the mechanism through which it lowers extracellular LDLR protein levels is uncertain.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">PCSK9 is a prohormone-proprotein convertase in the subtilisin (S8) family of serine proteases (Seidah et al., 2003). Humans have nine prohormone-proprotein convertases that can be divided between the S8A and S8B subfamilies (Rawlings et al., 2006). Furin, PC1/PC3, PC2, PACE4, PC4, PC5/PC6 and PC7/PC8/LPC/SPC7 are classified in subfamily S8B. Crystal and NMR structures of different domains from mouse furin and PC1 reveal subtilisin-like pro- and catalytic domains, and a P domain directly C-terminal to the catalytic domain (Henrich et al., 2003; Tangrea et al., 2002). Based on the amino acid sequence similarity within this subfamily, all seven members are predicted to have similar structures (Henrich et al., 2005). SKI-1/S1P and PCSK9 are classified in subfamily S8A. Sequence comparisons with these proteins also suggest the presence of subtilisin-like pro- and catalytic domains (Sakai et al., 1998; Seidah et al., 2003; Seidah et al., 1999). In these proteins the amino acid sequence C-terminal to the catalytic domain is more variable and does not suggest the presence of a P domain.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Prohormone-proprotein convertases are expressed as zymogens and they mature through a multi step process. The function of the pro-domain in this process is two-fold. The pro-domain first acts as a chaperone and is required for proper folding of the catalytic domain (Ikemura et al., 1987). Once the catalytic domain is folded, autocatalysis occurs between the pro-domain and catalytic domain. Following this initial cleavage reaction, the pro-domain remains bound to the catalytic domain where it then acts as an inhibitor of catalytic activity (Fu et al., 2000). When conditions are correct, maturation proceeds with a second autocatalytic event at a site within the pro-domain (Anderson et al., 1997). After this second cleavage event occurs the pro-domain and catalytic domain dissociate, giving rise to an active protease.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Autocatalysis of the PCSK9 zymogen occurs between Gln152 and Ser153 (VFAQ|SIP) (Naureckiene et al., 2003), and has been shown to be required for its secretion from cells (Seidah et al., 2003). A second autocatalytic event at a site within PCSK9's pro-domain has not been observed. Purified PCSK9 is made up of two species that can be separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE; the pro-domain at 17 Kd, and the catalytic plus C-terminal domains at 65 Kd. PCSK9 has not been isolated without its inhibitory pro-domain, and measurements of PCSK9's catalytic activity have been variable (Naureckiene et al., 2003; Seidah et al., 2003).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the invention comprises an antigen binding protein to PCSK9.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some aspects, the invention comprises an isolated antigen binding protein that binds PCSK9 comprising: A) one or more heavy chain complementary determining regions (CDRHs) selected from the group consisting of: (i) a CDRH1 from a CDRH1 in a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 74, 85, 71, 72, 67, 87, 58, 52, 51, 53, 48, 54, 55, 56, 49, 57, 50, 91, 64, 62, 89, 65, 79, 80, 76, 77, 78, 83, 69, 81, and 60; (ii) a CDRH2 from a CDRH2 in a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 74, 85, 71, 72, 67, 87, 58, 52, 51, 53, 48, 54, 55, 56, 49, 57, 50, 91, 64, 62, 89, 65, 79, 80, 76, 77, 78, 83, 69, 81, and 60; (iii) a CDRH3 from a CDRH3 in a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 74, 85, 71, 72, 67, 87, 58, 52, 51, 53, 48, 54, 55, 56, 49, 57, 50, 91, 64, 62, 89, 65, 79, 80, 76, 77, 78, 83, 69, 81, and 60; and (iv) a CDRH of (i), (ii), and (iii) that contains one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions or insertions of no more than 4 amino acids; B) one or more light chain complementary determining regions (CDRLs) selected from the group consisting of: (i) a CDRL1 from a CDRL1 in a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 46; (ii) a CDRL2 from a CDRL2 in a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 46; (iii) a CDRL3 from a CDRL3 in a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 46; and (iv) a CDRL of (i), (ii) and (iii) that contains one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions or insertions of no more than 4 amino acids; or C) one or more heavy chain CDRHs of A) and one or more light chain CDRLs of B).

description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Antigen binding proteins (such as antibodies and functional binding fragments thereof) that bind to PCSK9 are disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins bind to PCSK9 and prevent PCSK9 from functioning in various ways. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins block or reduce the ability of PCSK9 to interact with other substances. For example, in some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to PCSK9 in a manner that prevents or reduces the likelihood that PCSK9 will bind to LDLR. In other embodiments, antigen binding proteins bind to PCSK9 but do not block PCSK9's ability to interact with LDLR. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins are human monoclonal antibodies.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in light of the present disclosure, altering the interactions between PCSK9 and LDLR can increase the amount of LDLR available for binding to LDL, which in turn decreases the amount of serum LDL in a subject, resulting in a reduction in the subject's serum cholesterol level. As such, antigen binding proteins to PCSK9 can be used in various methods and compositions for treating subjects with elevated serum cholesterol levels, at risk of elevated serum cholesterol levels, or which could benefit from a reduction in their serum cholesterol levels. Thus, various methods and techniques for lowering, maintaining, or preventing an increase in serum cholesterol are also described herein. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein allows for binding between PCSK9 and LDLR, but the antigen binding protein prevents or reduces the adverse activity of PCSK9 on LDLR. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein prevents or reduces the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">For convenience, the following sections generally outline the various meanings of the terms used herein. Following this discussion, general aspects regarding antigen binding proteins are discussed, followed by specific examples demonstrating the properties of various embodiments of the antigen binding proteins and how they can be employed.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DEFINITIONS AND EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0165" num="0164">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed. In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise. In this application, the use of &#x201c;or&#x201d; means &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term &#x201c;including&#x201d;, as well as other forms, such as &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and &#x201c;included&#x201d;, is not limiting. Also, terms such as &#x201c;element&#x201d; or &#x201c;component&#x201d; encompass both elements and components comprising one unit and elements and components that comprise more than one subunit unless specifically stated otherwise. Also, the use of the term &#x201c;portion&#x201d; can include part of a moiety or the entire moiety.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">The section headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the subject matter described. All documents, or portions of documents, cited in this application, including but not limited to patents, patent applications, articles, books, and treatises, are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety for any purpose. As utilized in accordance with the present disclosure, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">The term &#x201c;proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9&#x201d; or &#x201c;PCSK9&#x201d; refers to a polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or 3 or fragments thereof, as well as related polypeptides, which include, but are not limited to, allelic variants, splice variants, derivative variants, substitution variants, deletion variants, and/or insertion variants including the addition of an N-terminal methionine, fusion polypeptides, and interspecies homologs. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 polypeptide includes terminal residues, such as, but not limited to, leader sequence residues, targeting residues, amino terminal methionine residues, lysine residues, tag residues and/or fusion protein residues. &#x201c;PCSK9&#x201d; has also been referred to as FH3, NARC1, HCHOLA3, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, and neural apoptosis regulated convertase 1. The PCSK9 gene encodes a proprotein convertase protein that belongs to the proteinase K subfamily of the secretory subtilase family. The term &#x201c;PCSK9&#x201d; denotes both the proprotein and the product generated following autocatalysis of the proprotein. When only the autocatalyzed product is being referred to (such as for an antigen binding protein that selectively binds to the cleaved PCSK9), the protein can be referred to as the &#x201c;mature,&#x201d; &#x201c;cleaved&#x201d;, &#x201c;processed&#x201d; or &#x201c;active&#x201d; PCSK9. When only the inactive form is being referred to, the protein can be referred to as the &#x201c;inactive&#x201d;, &#x201c;pro-form&#x201d;, or &#x201c;unprocessed&#x201d; form of PCSK9. The term PCSK9 as used herein also includes naturally occurring alleles, such as the mutations D374Y, S127R and F216L. The term PCSK9 also encompasses PCSK9 molecules incorporating post-translational modifications of the PCSK9 amino acid sequence, such as PCSK9 sequences that have been glycosylated, PEGylated, PCSK9 sequences from which its signal sequence has been cleaved, PCSK9 sequence from which its pro domain has been cleaved from the catalytic domain but not separated from the catalytic domain (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">The term &#x201c;PCSK9 activity&#x201d; includes any biological effect of PCSK9. In certain embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to interact or bind to a substrate or receptor. In some embodiments, PCSK9 activity is represented by the ability of PCSK9 to bind to a LDL receptor (LDLR). In some embodiments, PCSK9 binds to and catalyzes a reaction involving LDLR. In some embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to alter (e.g., reduce) the availability of LDLR. In some embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to increase the amount of LDL in a subject. In some embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to decrease the amount of LDLR that is available to bind to LDL. In some embodiments, &#x201c;PCSK9 activity&#x201d; includes any biological activity resulting from PCSK9 signaling. Exemplary activities include, but are not limited to, PCSK9 binding to LDLR, PCSK9 enzyme activity that cleaves LDLR or other proteins, PCSK9 binding to proteins other than LDLR that facilitate PCSK9 action, PCSK9 altering APOB secretion (Sun X-M et al, &#x201c;Evidence for effect of mutant PCSK9 on apoliprotein B secretion as the cause of unusually severe dominant hypercholesterolemia, Human Molecular Genetics 14: 1161-1169, 2005 and Ouguerram K et al, &#x201c;Apolipoprotein B100 metabolism in autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemia related to mutations in PCSK9, Arterioscler thromb Vasc Biol. 24: 1448-1453, 2004), PCSK9's role in liver regeneration and neuronal cell differentiation (Seidah N G et al, &#x201c;The secretory proprotein convertase neural apoptosis-regulated convertase 1 (NARC-1): Liver regeneration and neuronal differentiation&#x201d; PNAS 100: 928-933, 2003), and PCSK9s role in hepatic glucose metabolism (Costet et al., &#x201c;Hepatic PCSK9 expression is regulated by nutritional status via insulin and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c&#x201d; <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>281(10):6211-18, 2006).</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">The term &#x201c;hypercholesterolemia,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a condition in which cholesterol levels are elevated above a desired level. In some embodiments, this denotes that serum cholesterol levels are elevated. In some embodiments, the desired level takes into account various &#x201c;risk factors&#x201d; that are known to one of skill in the art (and are described or referenced herein).</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">The term &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d; or &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; includes both single-stranded and double-stranded nucleotide polymers. The nucleotides comprising the polynucleotide can be ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide. Said modifications include base modifications such as bromouridine and inosine derivatives, ribose modifications such as 2&#x2032;,3&#x2032;-dideoxyribose, and internucleotide linkage modifications such as phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phoshoraniladate and phosphoroamidate.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">The term &#x201c;oligonucleotide&#x201d; means a polynucleotide comprising 200 or fewer nucleotides. In some embodiments, oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in length. In other embodiments, oligonucleotides are 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 to 40 nucleotides in length. Oligonucleotides can be single stranded or double stranded, e.g., for use in the construction of a mutant gene. Oligonucleotides can be sense or antisense oligonucleotides. An oligonucleotide can include a label, including a radiolabel, a fluorescent label, a hapten or an antigenic label, for detection assays. Oligonucleotides can be used, for example, as PCR primers, cloning primers or hybridization probes.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">An &#x201c;isolated nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; means a DNA or RNA of genomic, mRNA, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof which is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the isolated polynucleotide is found in nature, or is linked to a polynucleotide to which it is not linked in nature. For purposes of this disclosure, it should be understood that &#x201c;a nucleic acid molecule comprising&#x201d; a particular nucleotide sequence does not encompass intact chromosomes. Isolated nucleic acid molecules &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; specified nucleic acid sequences can include, in addition to the specified sequences, coding sequences for up to ten or even up to twenty other proteins or portions thereof, or can include operably linked regulatory sequences that control expression of the coding region of the recited nucleic acid sequences, and/or can include vector sequences.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">Unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of any single-stranded polynucleotide sequence discussed herein is the 5&#x2032; end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5&#x2032; direction. The direction of 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA transcript that are 5&#x2032; to the 5&#x2032; end of the RNA transcript are referred to as &#x201c;upstream sequences;&#x201d; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA transcript that are 3&#x2032; to the 3&#x2032; end of the RNA transcript are referred to as &#x201c;downstream sequences.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">The term &#x201c;control sequence&#x201d; refers to a polynucleotide sequence that can affect the expression and processing of coding sequences to which it is ligated. The nature of such control sequences can depend upon the host organism. In particular embodiments, control sequences for prokaryotes can include a promoter, a ribosomal binding site, and a transcription termination sequence. For example, control sequences for eukaryotes can include promoters comprising one or a plurality of recognition sites for transcription factors, transcription enhancer sequences, and transcription termination sequence. &#x201c;Control sequences&#x201d; can include leader sequences and/or fusion partner sequences.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">The term &#x201c;vector&#x201d; means any molecule or entity (e.g., nucleic acid, plasmid, bacteriophage or virus) used to transfer protein coding information into a host cell.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">The term &#x201c;expression vector&#x201d; or &#x201c;expression construct&#x201d; refers to a vector that is suitable for transformation of a host cell and contains nucleic acid sequences that direct and/or control (in conjunction with the host cell) expression of one or more heterologous coding regions operatively linked thereto. An expression construct can include, but is not limited to, sequences that affect or control transcription, translation, and, if introns are present, affect RNA splicing of a coding region operably linked thereto.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">As used herein, &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; means that the components to which the term is applied are in a relationship that allows them to carry out their inherent functions under suitable conditions. For example, a control sequence in a vector that is &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; to a protein coding sequence is ligated thereto so that expression of the protein coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the transcriptional activity of the control sequences.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">The term &#x201c;host cell&#x201d; means a cell that has been transformed, or is capable of being transformed, with a nucleic acid sequence and thereby expresses a gene of interest. The term includes the progeny of the parent cell, whether or not the progeny is identical in morphology or in genetic make-up to the original parent cell, so long as the gene of interest is present.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">The term &#x201c;transfection&#x201d; means the uptake of foreign or exogenous DNA by a cell, and a cell has been &#x201c;transfected&#x201d; when the exogenous DNA has been introduced inside the cell membrane. A number of transfection techniques are well known in the art and are disclosed herein. See, e.g., Graham et al., 1973<i>, Virology </i>52:456; Sambrook et al., 2001, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, supra; Davis et al., 1986<i>, Basic Methods in Molecular Biology</i>, Elsevier; Chu et al., 1981<i>, Gene </i>13:197. Such techniques can be used to introduce one or more exogenous DNA moieties into suitable host cells.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">The term &#x201c;transformation&#x201d; refers to a change in a cell's genetic characteristics, and a cell has been transformed when it has been modified to contain new DNA or RNA. For example, a cell is transformed where it is genetically modified from its native state by introducing new genetic material via transfection, transduction, or other techniques. Following transfection or transduction, the transforming DNA can recombine with that of the cell by physically integrating into a chromosome of the cell, or can be maintained transiently as an episomal element without being replicated, or can replicate independently as a plasmid. A cell is considered to have been &#x201c;stably transformed&#x201d; when the transforming DNA is replicated with the division of the cell.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">The terms &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; or &#x201c;protein&#x201d; means a macromolecule having the amino acid sequence of a native protein, that is, a protein produced by a naturally-occurring and non-recombinant cell; or it is produced by a genetically-engineered or recombinant cell, and comprise molecules having the amino acid sequence of the native protein, or molecules having deletions from, additions to, and/or substitutions of one or more amino acids of the native sequence. The term also includes amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acids are chemical analogs of a corresponding naturally-occurring amino acid and polymers. The terms &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; specifically encompass PCSK9 antigen binding proteins, antibodies, or sequences that have deletions from, additions to, and/or substitutions of one or more amino acid of antigen-binding protein. The term &#x201c;polypeptide fragment&#x201d; refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal deletion, a carboxyl-terminal deletion, and/or an internal deletion as compared with the full-length native protein. Such fragments can also contain modified amino acids as compared with the native protein. In certain embodiments, fragments are about five to 500 amino acids long. For example, fragments can be at least 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 20, 50, 70, 100, 110, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, or 450 amino acids long. Useful polypeptide fragments include immunologically functional fragments of antibodies, including binding domains. In the case of a PCSK9-binding antibody, useful fragments include but are not limited to a CDR region, a variable domain of a heavy and/or light chain, a portion of an antibody chain or just its variable region including two CDRs, and the like.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">The term &#x201c;isolated protein&#x201d; referred means that a subject protein (1) is free of at least some other proteins with which it would normally be found, (2) is essentially free of other proteins from the same source, e.g., from the same species, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, (4) has been separated from at least about 50 percent of polynucleotides, lipids, carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is associated in nature, (5) is operably associated (by covalent or noncovalent interaction) with a polypeptide with which it is not associated in nature, or (6) does not occur in nature. Typically, an &#x201c;isolated protein&#x201d; constitutes at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 25%, or at least about 50% of a given sample. Genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA or other RNA, of synthetic origin, or any combination thereof can encode such an isolated protein. Preferably, the isolated protein is substantially free from proteins or polypeptides or other contaminants that are found in its natural environment that would interfere with its therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic, research or other use.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">The term &#x201c;amino acid&#x201d; includes its normal meaning in the art.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">A &#x201c;variant&#x201d; of a polypeptide (e.g., an antigen binding protein, or an antibody) comprises an amino acid sequence wherein one or more amino acid residues are inserted into, deleted from and/or substituted into the amino acid sequence relative to another polypeptide sequence. Variants include fusion proteins.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">The term &#x201c;identity&#x201d; refers to a relationship between the sequences of two or more polypeptide molecules or two or more nucleic acid molecules, as determined by aligning and comparing the sequences. &#x201c;Percent identity&#x201d; means the percent of identical residues between the amino acids or nucleotides in the compared molecules and is calculated based on the size of the smallest of the molecules being compared. For these calculations, gaps in alignments (if any) are preferably addressed by a particular mathematical model or computer program (i.e., an &#x201c;algorithm&#x201d;). Methods that can be used to calculate the identity of the aligned nucleic acids or polypeptides include those described in <i>Computational Molecular Biology</i>, (Lesk, A.

Applied Math. </i>48:1073.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">In calculating percent identity, the sequences being compared are typically aligned in a way that gives the largest match between the sequences. One example of a computer program that can be used to determine percent identity is the GCG program package, which includes GAP (Devereux et al., 1984<i>, Nucl. Acid Res. </i>12:387; Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.). The computer algorithm GAP is used to align the two polypeptides or polynucleotides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined. The sequences are aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acid or nucleotide (the &#x201c;matched span&#x201d;, as determined by the algorithm). A gap opening penalty (which is calculated as 3&#xd7; the average diagonal, wherein the &#x201c;average diagonal&#x201d; is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the &#x201c;diagonal&#x201d; is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually 1/10 times the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as PAM 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. In certain embodiments, a standard comparison matrix (see, Dayhoff et al., 1978<i>, Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure </i>5:345-352 for the PAM 250 comparison matrix; Henikoff et al., 1992<i>, Proc.

Accordingly; the selected alignment method (GAP program) can be adjusted if so desired to result in an alignment that spans at least 50 or other number of contiguous amino acids of the target polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">As used herein, the twenty conventional (e.g., naturally occurring) amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage.

Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides can be used to produce a similar therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from: &#x2014;CH<sub>2 </sub>NH&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH<sub>2 </sub>S&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH&#x2550;CH-(cis and trans), &#x2014;COCH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH(OH)CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, and &#x2014;CH<sub>2 </sub>SO&#x2014;, by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) can be used in certain embodiments to generate more stable peptides.

The term &#x201c;immunologically functional fragment&#x201d; (or simply &#x201c;fragment&#x201d;) of an antibody or immunoglobulin chain (heavy or light chain) antigen binding protein, as used herein, is a species of antigen binding protein comprising a portion (regardless of how that portion is obtained or synthesized) of an antibody that lacks at least some of the amino acids present in a full-length chain but which is still capable of specifically binding to an antigen. Such fragments are biologically active in that they bind to the target antigen and can compete with other antigen binding proteins, including intact antibodies, for binding to a given epitope. In some embodiments, the fragments are neutralizing fragments. In some embodiments, the fragments can block or reduce the likelihood of the interaction between LDLR and PCSK9. In one aspect, such a fragment will retain at least one CDR present in the full-length light or heavy chain, and in some embodiments will comprise a single heavy chain and/or light chain or portion thereof.

For example, that portion of an antigen binding protein that contains the amino acid residues that interact with an antigen and confer on the antigen binding protein its specificity and affinity for the antigen is referred to as &#x201c;antigen binding region.&#x201d; An antigen binding region typically includes one or more &#x201c;complementary binding regions&#x201d; (&#x201c;CDRs&#x201d;). Certain antigen binding regions also include one or more &#x201c;framework&#x201d; regions. A &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; is an amino acid sequence that contributes to antigen binding specificity and affinity. &#x201c;Framework&#x201d; regions can aid in maintaining the proper conformation of the CDRs to promote binding between the antigen binding region and an antigen. Structurally, framework regions can be located in antibodies between CDRs. Examples of framework and CDR regions are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-3D</figref>, <b>3</b>CCC-<b>3</b>JJJ, and <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>D.

In this context, a &#x201c;recombinant antigen binding protein&#x201d; is a protein made using recombinant techniques, i.e., through the expression of a recombinant nucleic acid as described herein. Methods and techniques for the production of recombinant proteins are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0228">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; refers to an intact immunoglobulin of any isotype, or a fragment thereof that can compete with the intact antibody for specific binding to the target antigen, and includes, for instance, chimeric, humanized, fully human, and bispecific antibodies. An &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; is a species of an antigen binding protein. An intact antibody will generally comprise at least two full-length heavy chains and two full-length light chains, but in some instances can include fewer chains such as antibodies naturally occurring in camelids which can comprise only heavy chains. Antibodies can be derived solely from a single source, or can be &#x201c;chimeric,&#x201d; that is, different portions of the antibody can be derived from two different antibodies as described further below. The antigen binding proteins, antibodies, or binding fragments can be produced in hybridomas, by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Unless otherwise indicated, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; includes, in addition to antibodies comprising two full-length heavy chains and two full-length light chains, derivatives, variants, fragments, and muteins thereof, examples of which are described below. Furthermore, unless explicitly excluded, antibodies include monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, minibodies, domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred to herein as &#x201c;antibody mimetics&#x201d;), chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, antibody fusions (sometimes referred to herein as &#x201c;antibody conjugates&#x201d;), and fragments thereof, respectively. In some embodiments, the term also encompasses peptibodies.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0229">Naturally occurring antibody structural units typically comprise a tetramer. Each such tetramer typically is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one full-length &#x201c;light&#x201d; (in certain embodiments, about 25 kDa) and one full-length &#x201c;heavy&#x201d; chain (in certain embodiments, about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain typically includes a variable region of about 100 to 10 or more amino acids that typically is responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain typically defines a constant region that can be responsible for effector function. Human light chains are typically classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are typically classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. IgG has several subclasses, including, but not limited to, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. IgM has subclasses including, but not limited to, IgM1 and IgM2. IgA is similarly subdivided into subclasses including, but not limited to, IgA1 and IgA2. Within full-length light and heavy chains, typically, the variable and constant regions are joined by a &#x201c;J&#x201d; region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a &#x201c;D&#x201d; region of about 10 more amino acids. See, e.g., <i>Fundamental Immunology</i>, Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair typically form the antigen binding site.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0230">The variable regions typically exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hyper variable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the two chains of each pair typically are aligned by the framework regions, which can enable binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chain variable regions typically comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is typically in accordance with the definitions of Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and 1991)), or Chothia &#x26; Lesk, J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917 (1987); Chothia et al., Nature, 342:878-883 (1989).</p><p id="p-0234" num="0231">In certain embodiments, an antibody heavy chain binds to an antigen in the absence of an antibody light chain.

In certain embodiments, that can be accomplished by any of a variety of techniques known to those skilled in the art, such as X-ray crystallography. In certain embodiments, various methods of analysis can be employed to identify or approximate the CDR regions. Examples of such methods include, but are not limited to, the Kabat definition, the Chothia definition, the AbM definition and the contact definition.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0233">The Kabat definition is a standard for numbering the residues in an antibody and is typically used to identify CDR regions. See, e.g., Johnson &#x26; Wu, Nucleic Acids Res., 28: 214-8 (2000). The Chothia definition is similar to the Kabat definition, but the Chothia definition takes into account positions of certain structural loop regions. See, e.g., Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol., 196: 901-17 (1986); Chothia et al., Nature, 342: 877-83 (1989). The AbM definition uses an integrated suite of computer programs produced by Oxford Molecular Group that model antibody structure. See, e.g., Martin et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA), 86:9268-9272 (1989); &#x201c;AbM&#x2122;, A Computer Program for Modeling Variable Regions of Antibodies,&#x201d; Oxford, UK; Oxford Molecular, Ltd. The AbM definition models the tertiary structure of an antibody from primary sequence using a combination of knowledge databases and ab initio methods, such as those described by Samudrala et al., &#x201c;Ab Initio Protein Structure Prediction Using a Combined Hierarchical Approach,&#x201d; in PROTEINS, Structure, Function and Genetics Suppl., 3:194-198 (1999). The contact definition is based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. See, e.g., MacCallum et al., J. Mol. Biol., 5:732-45 (1996).</p><p id="p-0237" num="0234">By convention, the CDR regions in the heavy chain are typically referred to as H1, H2, and H3 and are numbered sequentially in the direction from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus. The CDR regions in the light chain are typically referred to as L1, L2, and L3 and are numbered sequentially in the direction from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0235">The term &#x201c;light chain&#x201d; includes a full-length light chain and fragments thereof having sufficient variable region sequence to confer binding specificity. A full-length light chain includes a variable region domain, V<sub>L</sub>, and a constant region domain, C<sub>L</sub>. The variable region domain of the light chain is at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide. Light chains include kappa chains and lambda chains.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0236">The term &#x201c;heavy chain&#x201d; includes a full-length heavy chain and fragments thereof having sufficient variable region sequence to confer binding specificity. A full-length heavy chain includes a variable region domain, V<sub>H</sub>, and three constant region domains, C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2, and C<sub>H</sub>3. The V<sub>H </sub>domain is at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide, and the C<sub>H </sub>domains are at the carboxyl-terminus, with the C<sub>H</sub>3 being closest to the carboxy-terminus of the polypeptide. Heavy chains can be of any isotype, including IgG (including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 subtypes), IgA (including IgA1 and IgA2 subtypes), IgM and IgE.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0237">A bispecific or bifunctional antibody typically is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab&#x2032; fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol., 79: 315-321 (1990); Kostelny et al., J. Immunol., 148:1547-1553 (1992).</p><p id="p-0241" num="0238">Some species of mammals also produce antibodies having only a single heavy chain.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0239">Each individual immunoglobulin chain is typically composed of several &#x201c;immunoglobulin domains,&#x201d; each consisting of roughly 90 to 110 amino acids and having a characteristic folding pattern. These domains are the basic units of which antibody polypeptides are composed. In humans, the IgA and IgD isotypes contain four heavy chains and four light chains; the IgG and IgE isotypes contain two heavy chains and two light chains; and the IgM isotype contains five heavy chains and five light chains. The heavy chain C region typically comprises one or more domains that can be responsible for effector function. The number of heavy chain constant region domains will depend on the isotype. IgG heavy chains, for example, contain three C region domains known as C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2 and C<sub>H</sub>3. The antibodies that are provided can have any of these isotypes and subtypes. In certain embodiments of the present invention, an anti-PCSK9 antibody is of the IgG2 or IgG4 subtype.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0240">The term &#x201c;variable region&#x201d; or &#x201c;variable domain&#x201d; refers to a portion of the light and/or heavy chains of an antibody, typically including approximately the amino-terminal 120 to 130 amino acids in the heavy chain and about 100 to 110 amino terminal amino acids in the light chain. In certain embodiments, variable regions of different antibodies differ extensively in amino acid sequence even among antibodies of the same species. The variable region of an antibody typically determines specificity of a particular antibody for its target</p><p id="p-0244" num="0241">The term &#x201c;neutralizing antigen binding protein&#x201d; or &#x201c;neutralizing antibody&#x201d; refers to an antigen binding protein or antibody, respectively, that binds to a ligand and prevents or reduces the biological effect of that ligand. This can be done, for example, by directly blocking a binding site on the ligand or by binding to the ligand and altering the ligand's ability to bind through indirect means (such as structural or energetic alterations in the ligand). In some embodiments, the term can also denote an antigen binding protein that prevents the protein to which it is bound from performing a biological function. In assessing the binding and/or specificity of an antigen binding protein, e.g., an antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof, an antibody or fragment can substantially inhibit binding of a ligand to its binding partner when an excess of antibody reduces the quantity of binding partner bound to the ligand by at least about 1-20, 20-30%, 30-40%, 40-50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-85%, 85-90%, 90-95%, 95-97%, 97-98%, 98-99% or more (as measured in an in vitro competitive binding assay). In some embodiments, in the case of PCSK9 antigen binding proteins, such a neutralizing molecule can diminish the ability of PCSK9 to bind the LDLR. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ability is characterized and/or described via a competition assay. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ability is described in terms of an IC<sub>50 </sub>or EC<sub>50 </sub>value. In some embodiments, ABPs 27B2, 13H1, 13B5 and 3C4 are non-neutralizing ABPs, 3B6, 9C9 and 31A4 are weak neutralizers, and the remaining ABPs in Table 2 are strong neutralizers. In some embodiments, the antibodies or antigen binding proteins neutralize by binding to PCSK9 and preventing PCSK9 from binding to LDLR (or reducing the ability of PCSK9 to bind to LDLR). In some embodiments, the antibodies or ABPs neutralize by binding to PCSK9, and while still allowing PCSK9 to bind to LDLR, preventing or reducing the PCSK9 mediated degradation of LDLR. Thus, in some embodiments, a neutralizing ABP or antibody can still permit PCSK9/LDLR binding, but will prevent (or reduce) subsequent PCSK9 involved degradation of LDLR.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0242">The term &#x201c;target&#x201d; refers to a molecule or a portion of a molecule capable of being bound by an antigen binding protein. In certain embodiments, a target can have one or more epitopes. In certain embodiments, a target is an antigen. The use of &#x201c;antigen&#x201d; in the phrase &#x201c;antigen binding protein&#x201d; simply denotes that the protein sequence that comprises the antigen can be bound by an antibody. In this context, it does not require that the protein be foreign or that it be capable of inducing an immune response.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0243">The term &#x201c;compete&#x201d; when used in the context of antigen binding proteins (e.g., neutralizing antigen binding proteins or neutralizing antibodies) that compete for the same epitope means competition between antigen binding proteins as determined by an assay in which the antigen binding protein (e.g., antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof) being tested prevents or inhibits (e.g., reduces) specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein (e.g., a ligand, or a reference antibody) to a common antigen (e.g., PCSK9 or a fragment thereof). Numerous types of competitive binding assays can be used to determine if one antigen binding protein competes with another, for example: solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see, e.g., Stahli et al., 1983<i>, Methods in Enzymology </i>9:242-253); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Kirkland et al., 1986<i>, J. Immunol. </i>137:3614-3619) solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, 1988<i>, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual</i>, Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid phase direct label RIA using I-125 label (see, e.g., Morel et al., 1988<i>, Molec. Immunol. </i>25:7-15); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Cheung, et al., 1990<i>, Virology </i>176:546-552); and direct labeled RIA (Moldenhauer et al., 1990<i>, Scand. J. Immunol. </i>32:77-82). Typically, such an assay involves the use of purified antigen bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of these, an unlabelled test antigen binding protein and a labeled reference antigen binding protein. Competitive inhibition is measured by determining the amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test antigen binding protein. Usually the test antigen binding protein is present in excess. Antigen binding proteins identified by competition assay (competing antigen binding proteins) include antigen binding proteins binding to the same epitope as the reference antigen binding proteins and antigen binding proteins binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference antigen binding protein for steric hindrance to occur. Additional details regarding methods for determining competitive binding are provided in the examples herein. Usually, when a competing antigen binding protein is present in excess, it will inhibit (e.g., reduce) specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein to a common antigen by at least 40-45%, 45-50%, 50-55%, 55-60%, 60-65%, 65-70%, 70-75% or 75% or more. In some instances, binding is inhibited by at least 80-85%, 85-90%, 90-95%, 95-97%, or 97% or more.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0244">The term &#x201c;antigen&#x201d; refers to a molecule or a portion of a molecule capable of being bound by a selective binding agent, such as an antigen binding protein (including, e.g., an antibody or immunological functional fragment thereof). In some embodiments, the antigen is capable of being used in an animal to produce antibodies capable of binding to that antigen. An antigen can possess one or more epitopes that are capable of interacting with different antigen binding proteins, e.g., antibodies.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0245">The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; includes any determinant capable being bound by an antigen binding protein, such as an antibody or to a T-cell receptor. An epitope is a region of an antigen that is bound by an antigen binding protein that targets that antigen, and when the antigen is a protein, includes specific amino acids that directly contact the antigen binding protein. Most often, epitopes reside on proteins, but in some instances can reside on other kinds of molecules, such as nucleic acids. Epitope determinants can include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl or sulfonyl groups, and can have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics. Generally, antibodies specific for a particular target antigen will preferentially recognize an epitope on the target antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0246">As used herein, &#x201c;substantially pure&#x201d; means that the described species of molecule is the predominant species present, that is, on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual species in the same mixture. In certain embodiments, a substantially pure molecule is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least 50% (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present. In other embodiments, a substantially pure composition will comprise at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of all macromolecular species present in the composition. In other embodiments, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity wherein contaminating species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods and thus the composition consists of a single detectable macromolecular species.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0247">The term &#x201c;agent&#x201d; is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological materials.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0248">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;label&#x201d; or &#x201c;labeled&#x201d; refers to incorporation of a detectable marker, e.g., by incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to a polypeptide of biotin moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g., streptavidin containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or colorimetric methods). In certain embodiments, the label or marker can also be therapeutic. Various methods of labeling polypeptides and glycoproteins are known in the art and can be used. Examples of labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g., <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>90</sup>Y, <sup>99</sup>Tc, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>131</sup>I), fluorescent labels (e.g., FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, &#x3b2;-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase), chemiluminescent, biotinyl groups, predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags).

PCSK9 is a prohormone-proprotein convertase in the subtilisin (S8) family of serine proteases (Seidah et al., 2003). An exemplary human PCSK9 amino acid sequence is presented as SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 3. in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> (depicting the &#x201c;pro&#x201d; domain of the protein as underlined) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> (depicting the signal sequence in bold and the pro domain underlined). An exemplary human PCSK9 coding sequence is presented as SEQ ID NO: 2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). As described herein, PCSK9 proteins can also include fragments of the full length PCSK9 protein. The structure of the PCSK9 protein has recently been solved by two groups (Cunningham et al., Nature Structural &#x26; Molecular Biology, 2007, and Piper et al., Structure, 15:1-8, 2007), the entireties of both of which are herein incorporated by reference. PCSK9 includes a signal sequence, a N-terminal prodomain, a subtilisin-like catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0258">Antigen binding proteins (ABPs) that bind PCSK9, including human PCSK9, are provided herein. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins provided are polypeptides which comprise one or more complementary determining regions (CDRs), as described herein. In some antigen binding proteins, the CDRs are embedded into a &#x201c;framework&#x201d; region, which orients the CDR(s) such that the proper antigen binding properties of the CDR(s) is achieved. In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins provided herein can interfere with, block, reduce or modulate the interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR. Such antigen binding proteins are denoted as &#x201c;neutralizing.&#x201d; In some embodiments, binding between PCSK9 and LDLR can still occur, even though the antigen binding protein is neutralizing and bound to PCSK9. For example, in some embodiments, the ABP prevents or reduces the adverse influence of PCSK9 on LDLR without blocking the LDLR binding site on PCSK9. Thus, in some embodiments, the ABP modulates or alters PCSK9's ability to result in the degradation of LDLR, without having to prevent the binding interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR. Such ABPs can be specifically described as &#x201c;non-competitively neutralizing&#x201d; ABPs. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ABP binds to PCSK9 in a location and/or manner that prevents PCSK9 from binding to LDLR. Such ABPs can be specifically described as &#x201c;competitively neutralizing&#x201d; ABPs. Both of the above neutralizers can result in a greater amount of free LDLR being present in a subject, which results in more LDLR binding to LDL (thereby reducing the amount of LDL in the subject). In turn, this results in a reduction in the amount of serum cholesterol present in a subject.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0259">In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins provided herein are capable of inhibiting PCSK9-mediated activity (including binding). In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins binding to these epitopes inhibit, inter alia, interactions between PCSK9 and LDLR and other physiological effects mediated by PCSK9. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins are human, such as fully human antibodies to PCSK9.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0260">In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the mature form of PCSK9. In some embodiments the ABP binds in the prodomain of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP selectively binds to the mature form of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain in a manner such that PCSK9 cannot bind or bind as efficiently to LDLR. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein does not bind to the c-terminus of the cataylytic domain. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein does not bind to the n-terminus of the catalytic domain. In some embodiments, the ABP does not bind to the n- or c-terminus of the PCSK9 protein. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to any one of the epitopes bound by the antibodies discussed herein. In some embodiments, this can be determined by competition assays between the antibodies disclosed herein and other antibodies. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to an epitope bound by one of the antibodies described in Table 2. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins bind to a specific conformational state of PCSK9 so as to prevent PCSK9 from interacting with LDLR. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9 and prevents (or reduces) PCSK9 from binding to LDLR. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9, and while it does not prevent (or reduce) the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, the ABP prevents or reduces the adverse activities mediated through PCSK9 on LDLR.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0261">The antigen binding proteins that are disclosed herein have a variety of utilities. Some of the antigen binding proteins, for instance, are useful in specific binding assays, affinity purification of PCSK9, in particular human PCSK9 or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of PCSK9 activity. Some of the antigen binding proteins are useful for inhibiting binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, or inhibiting PCSK9-mediated activities.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0262">The antigen binding proteins can be used in a variety of therapeutic applications, as explained herein.

Other uses for the antigen binding proteins include, for example, diagnosis of PCSK9-associated diseases or conditions and screening assays to determine the presence or absence of PCSK9.

In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein does not bind to the c-terminus of the cataylytic domain (e.g., the 5. 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-40 most amino acids in the c-terminus). In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein does not bind to the n-terminus of the catalytic domain (e.g., the 5. 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-40 most amino acids in the n-terminus). In some embodiments, the ABP binds to amino acids within amino acids 1-100 of the mature form of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to amino acids within (and/or amino acid sequences consisting of) amino acids 31-100, 100-200, 31-152, 153-692, 200-300, 300-400, 452-683, 400-500, 500-600, 31-692, 31-449, and/or 600-692. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain. In some embodiments, the neutralizing and/or non-neutralizing ABP binds to the prodomain. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to both the catalytic and pro domains. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain so as to obstruct an area on the catalytic domain that interacts with the pro domain. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain at a location or surface that the pro-domain interacts with as outlined in Piper et al. (Structure 15:1-8 (2007), the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference, including the structural representations therein). In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain and restricts the mobility of the prodomain. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain without binding to the pro-domain. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain, without binding to the pro-domain, while preventing the pro-domain from reorienting to allow PCSK9 to bind to LDLR. In some embodiments, the ABP binds in the same epitope as those surrounding residues 149-152 of the pro-domain in Piper et al. In some embodiments, the ABPs bind to the groove (as outlined in Piper et al.) on the V domain. In some embodiments, the ABPs bind to the histidine-rich patch proximal to the groove on the V domain. In some embodiments, such antibodies (that bind to the V domain) are not neutralizing. In some embodiments, antibodies that bind to the V domain are neutralizing. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ABPs prevent the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR. In some embodiments, the neturalizing ABPs, while preventing the PCSK9 degradation of LDLR, do not prevent the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR (for example ABP 31A4). In some embodiments, the ABP binds to or blocks at least one of the histidines depicted in FIG. 4 of the Piper et al. paper.

In some embodiments, the antibody selectively inhibits variant D374Y PCSK9 from interacting with LDLR over wild type PCSK9's ability to interact with LDLR. In some embodiments, these antibodies block the variant's ability to bind to LDLR more strongly than the wild type's ability, e.g., at least twice as strongly as the wild type, and preferably 2-5, 5-10, 10-100, 100-1000 fold or more to the mutant than the wild type (as measured via an IC<sub>50</sub>). In some embodiments, the antibody binds to and neutralizes both wild type PCSK9 and variant forms of PCSK9, such as D374Y at similar levels. In some embodiments, the antibody binds to PCSK9 to prevent variants of LDLR from binding to PCSK9. In some embodiments, the variants of LDLR are at least 50% identical to human LDLR.

In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art can identify suitable areas of the molecule that may be changed without destroying activity by targeting regions not believed to be important for activity. In certain embodiments, one can identify residues and portions of the molecules that are conserved among similar polypeptides.

In view of such information, one skilled in the art can predict the alignment of amino acid residues of an antibody with respect to its three dimensional structure. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art can choose not to make radical changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the protein, since such residues can be involved in important interactions with other molecules. Moreover, one skilled in the art can generate test variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each desired amino acid residue. The variants can then be screened using activity assays known to those skilled in the art. Such variants can be used to gather information about suitable variants. For example, if one discovered that a change to a particular amino acid residue resulted in destroyed, undesirably reduced, or unsuitable activity, variants with such a change can be avoided.

See Moult J., Curr. Op. in Biotech., 7(4):422-427 (1996), Chou et al., Biochemistry, 13(2):222-245 (1974); Chou et al., Biochemistry, 113(2):211-222 (1974); Chou et al., Adv. Enzymol. Relat.

Moreover, computer programs are currently available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting secondary structure is based upon homology modeling. For example, two polypeptides or proteins which have a sequence identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater than 40% often have similar structural topologies. The recent growth of the protein structural database (PDB) has provided enhanced predictability of secondary structure, including the potential number of folds within a polypeptide's or protein's structure. See Holm et al., Nucl. Acid. Res., 27(1):244-247 (1999). It has been suggested (Brenner et al., Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 7(3):369-376 (1997)) that there are a limited number of folds in a given polypeptide or protein and that once a critical number of structures have been resolved, structural prediction will become dramatically more accurate.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0303">Additional methods of predicting secondary structure include &#x201c;threading&#x201d; (Jones, D., Curr.

In certain embodiments, protein variants comprise a greater or a lesser number of N-linked glycosylation sites than the native protein. An N-linked glycosylation site is characterized by the sequence: Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr, wherein the amino acid residue designated as X can be any amino acid residue except proline. The substitution of amino acid residues to create this sequence provides a potential new site for the addition of an N-linked carbohydrate chain. Alternatively, substitutions which eliminate this sequence will remove an existing N-linked carbohydrate chain. Also provided is a rearrangement of N-linked carbohydrate chains wherein one or more N-linked glycosylation sites (typically those that are naturally occurring) are eliminated and one or more new N-linked sites are created. Additional preferred antibody variants include cysteine variants wherein one or more cysteine residues are deleted from or substituted for another amino acid (e.g., serine) as compared to the parent amino acid sequence. Cysteine variants can be useful when antibodies must be refolded into a biologically active conformation such as after the isolation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Cysteine variants generally have fewer cysteine residues than the native protein, and typically have an even number to minimize interactions resulting from unpaired cysteines.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0305">According to certain embodiments, amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and/or (4) confer or modify other physiocochemical or functional properties on such polypeptides. According to certain embodiments, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (in certain embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions) can be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (in certain embodiments, in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts). In certain embodiments, a conservative amino acid substitution typically may not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence).

For example, an ABP variant can have at least 80, 80-85, 85-90, 90-95, 95-97, 97-99 or greater identity to at least one nucleic acid sequence described in SEQ ID NOs: 152, 153, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151 or at least one to six (and various combinations thereof) of the CDR(s) encoded by the nucleic acid sequences in SEQ ID NOs: 152, 153, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, I10, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, and 151.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0307">In some embodiments, the antibody (or nucleic acid sequence encoding it) is a variant if the nucleic acid sequence that encodes the particular ABP (or the nucleic acid sequence itself) can selectively hybridize to any of the nucleic acid sequences that encode the proteins in Table 2 (such as, but not limited to SEQ ID NO: 152, 153, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, and 151) under stringent conditions. In one embodiment, suitable moderately stringent conditions include prewashing in a solution of 5&#xd7;SSC; 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8:0); hybridizing at 50&#xb0; C., &#x2212;65&#xb0; C., 5&#xd7;SSC, overnight or, in the event of cross-species homology, at 45&#xb0; C. with 0.5&#xd7;SSC; followed by washing twice at 65&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes with each of 2&#xd7;, 0.5&#xd7; and 0.2&#xd7;SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Such hybridizing DNA sequences are also within the scope of this invention, as are nucleotide sequences that, due to code degeneracy, encode an antibody polypeptide that is encoded by a hybridizing DNA sequence and the amino acid sequences that are encoded by these nucleic acid sequences. In some embodiments, variants of CDRs include nucleic acid sequences and the amino acid sequences encoded by those sequences, that hybridize to one or more of the CDRs within the sequences noted above (individual CDRs can readily be determined in light of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-3D</figref>, and other embodiments in FIGS. <b>3</b>CCC-<b>3</b>JJJ and <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>D). The phrase &#x201c;selectively hybridize&#x201d; referred to in this context means to detectably and selectively bind. Polynucleotides, oligonucleotides and fragments thereof in accordance with the invention selectively hybridize to nucleic acid strands under hybridization and wash conditions that minimize appreciable amounts of detectable binding to nonspecific nucleic acids. High stringency conditions can be used to achieve selective hybridization conditions as known in the art and discussed herein. Generally, the nucleic acid sequence homology between the polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, and fragments of the invention and a nucleic acid sequence of interest will be at least 80%, and more typically with preferably increasing homologies of at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, and 100%. Two amino acid sequences are homologous if there is a partial or complete identity between their sequences. For example, 85% homology means that 85% of the amino acids are identical when the two sequences are aligned for maximum matching. Gaps (in either of the two sequences being matched) are allowed in maximizing matching; gap lengths of 5 or less are preferred with 2 or less being more preferred. Alternatively and preferably, two protein sequences (or polypeptide sequences derived from them of at least 30 amino acids in length) are homologous, as this term is used herein, if they have an alignment score of at more than 5 (in standard deviation units) using the program ALIGN with the mutation data matrix and a gap penalty of 6 or greater. See Dayhoff, M. O., in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, pp. 101-110 (Volume 5, National Biomedical Research Foundation (1972)) and Supplement 2 to this volume, pp. 1-10. The two sequences or parts thereof are more preferably homologous if their amino acids are greater than or equal to 50% identical when optimally aligned using the ALIGN program. The term &#x201c;corresponds to&#x201d; is used herein to mean that a polynucleotide sequence is homologous (i.e., is identical, not strictly evolutionarily related) to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence, or that a polypeptide sequence is identical to a reference polypeptide sequence. In contradistinction, the term &#x201c;complementary to&#x201d; is used herein to mean that the complementary sequence is homologous to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence. For illustration, the nucleotide sequence &#x201c;TATAC&#x201d; corresponds to a reference sequence &#x201c;TATAC&#x201d; and is complementary to a reference sequence &#x201c;GTATA&#x201d;.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Preparation of Antigen Binding Proteins (e.g., Antibodies)</heading><p id="p-0313" num="0308">In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins (such as antibodies) are produced by immunization with an antigen (e.g., PCSK9). In certain embodiments, antibodies can be produced by immunization with full-length PCSK9, a soluble form of PCSK9, the catalytic domain alone, the mature form of PCSK9 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a splice variant form of PCSK9, or a fragment thereof. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention can be polyclonal or monoclonal, and/or can be recombinant antibodies. In certain embodiments, antibodies of the invention are human antibodies prepared, for example, by immunization of transgenic animals capable of producing human antibodies (see, for example, PCT Published Application No. WO 93/12227).</p><p id="p-0314" num="0309">In certain embodiments, certain strategies can be employed to manipulate inherent properties of an antibody, such as the affinity of an antibody for its target. Such strategies include, but are not limited to, the use of site-specific or random mutagenesis of the polynucleotide molecule encoding an antibody to generate an antibody variant. In certain embodiments, such generation is followed by screening for antibody variants that exhibit the desired change, e.g. increased or decreased affinity.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0310">In certain embodiments, the amino acid residues targeted in mutagenic strategies are those in the CDRs. In certain embodiments, amino acids in the framework regions of the variable domains are targeted. In certain embodiments, such framework regions have been shown to contribute to the target binding properties of certain antibodies. See, e.g., Hudson, Curr. Opin. Biotech., 9:395-402 (1999) and references therein.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0311">In certain embodiments, smaller and more effectively screened libraries of antibody variants are produced by restricting random or site-directed mutagenesis to hyper-mutation sites in the CDRs, which are sites that correspond to areas prone to mutation during the somatic affinity maturation process. See, e.g., Chowdhury &#x26; Pastan, Nature Biotech., 17: 568-572 (1999) and references therein. In certain embodiments, certain types of DNA elements can be used to identify hyper-mutation sites including, but not limited to, certain direct and inverted repeats, certain consensus sequences, certain secondary structures, and certain palindromes. For example, such DNA elements that can be used to identify hyper-mutation sites include, but are not limited to, a tetrabase sequence comprising a purine (A or G), followed by guainine (G), followed by a pyrimidine (C or T), followed by either adenosine or thymidine (A or T) (i.e., A/G-G-C/T-A/T). Another example of a DNA element that can be used to identify hyper-mutation sites is the serine codon, A-G-C/T.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Preparation of Fully Human Abps (e.g., Antibodies)</heading><p id="p-0317" num="0312">In certain embodiments, a phage display technique is used to generate monoclonal antibodies. In certain embodiments, such techniques produce fully human monoclonal antibodies. In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide encoding a single Fab or Fv antibody fragment is expressed on the surface of a phage particle. See, e.g., Hoogenboom et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381 (1991); Marks et al., <i>J Mol Biol </i>222: 581 (1991); U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,793. In certain embodiments, phage are &#x201c;screened&#x201d; to identify those antibody fragments having affinity for target. Thus, certain such processes mimic immune selection through the display of antibody fragment repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, and subsequent selection of phage by their binding to target. In certain such procedures, high affinity functional neutralizing antibody fragments are isolated. In certain such embodiments (discussed in more detail below), a complete repertoire of human antibody genes is created by cloning naturally rearranged human V genes from peripheral blood lymphocytes. See, e.g., Mullinax et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA), 87: 8095-8099 (1990).</p><p id="p-0318" num="0313">According to certain embodiments, antibodies of the invention are prepared through the utilization of a transgenic mouse that has a substantial portion of the human antibody producing genome inserted but that is rendered deficient in the production of endogenous, murine antibodies. Such mice, then, are capable of producing human immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies and are deficient in the production of murine immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies. Technologies utilized for achieving this result are disclosed in the patents, applications and references disclosed in the specification, herein. In certain embodiments, one can employ methods such as those disclosed in PCT Published Application No. WO 98/24893 or in Mendez et al., Nature Genetics, 15:146-156 (1997), which are hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0314">Generally, fully human monoclonal ABPs (e.g., antibodies) specific for PCSK9 can be produced as follows. Transgenic mice containing human immunoglobulin genes are immunized with the antigen of interest, e.g. PCSK9, lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) from the mice that express antibodies are obtained. Such recovered cells are fused with a myeloid-type cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines, and such hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. In certain embodiments, the production of a hybridoma cell line that produces antibodies specific to PCSK9 is provided.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0315">In certain embodiments, fully human antibodies are produced by exposing human splenocytes (B or T cells) to an antigen in vitro, and then reconstituting the exposed cells in an immunocompromised mouse, e.g. SCID or nod/SCID. See, e.g., Brams et al., J. Immunol. 160: 2051-2058 (1998); Carballido et al., Nat. Med., 6: 103-106 (2000). In certain such approaches, engraftment of human fetal tissue into SCID mice (SCID-hu) results in long-term hematopoiesis and human T-cell development. See, e.g., McCune et al., Science, 241:1532-1639 (1988); lfversen et al., Sem. Immunol., 8:243-248 (1996). In certain instances, humoral immune response in such chimeric mice is dependent on co-development of human T-cells in the animals. See, e.g., Martensson et al., Immunol., 83:1271-179 (1994). In certain approaches, human peripheral blood lymphocytes are transplanted into SCID mice. See, e.g., Mosier et al., Nature, 335:256-259 (1988). In certain such embodiments, when such transplanted cells are treated either with a priming agent, such as Staphylococcal Enterotoxin A (SEA), or with anti-human CD40 monoclonal antibodies, higher levels of B cell production is detected. See, e.g., Martensson et al., Immunol., 84: 224-230 (1995); Murphy et al., Blood, 86:1946-1953 (1995).</p><p id="p-0321" num="0316">Thus, in certain embodiments, fully human antibodies can be produced by the expression of recombinant DNA in host cells or by expression in hybridoma cells.

Certain methods for quantifying the degree of purification are known to those of skill in the art. Certain exemplary methods include, but are not limited to, determining the specific binding activity of the preparation and assessing the amount of a polypeptide within a preparation by SDS/PAGE analysis. Certain exemplary methods for assessing the amount of purification of a polypeptide preparation comprise calculating the binding activity of a preparation and comparing it to the binding activity of an initial extract.

In certain embodiments, partial purification can be accomplished by using fewer purification steps or by utilizing different forms of the same general purification scheme.

In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized to substantially inhibit binding of an anti-PCSK9 antibody or antigen binding protein to PCSK9.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0348">In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized to isolate antibodies or antigen binding proteins that bind to PCSK9. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized to generate antibodies or antigen binding proteins which bind to PCSK9. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope or a sequence comprising a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized as an immunogen to generate antibodies or antigen binding proteins that bind to PCSK9. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be administered to an animal, and antibodies that bind to PCSK9 can subsequently be obtained from the animal. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope or a sequence comprising a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized to interfere with normal PCSK9-mediated activity, such as association of PCSK9 with the LDLR.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0349">In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins disclosed herein bind specifically to N-terminal prodomain, a subtilisin-like catalytic domain and/or a C-terminal domain. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to the substrate-binding groove of PCSK-9 (described in Cunningham et al., incorporated herein in its entirety by reference).</p><p id="p-0355" num="0350">In some embodiments, the domain(s)/region(s) containing residues that are in contact with or are buried by an antibody can be identified by mutating specific residues in PCSK9 (e.g., a wild-type antigen) and determining whether the antigen binding protein can bind the mutated or variant PCSK9 protein. By making a number of individual mutations, residues that play a direct role in binding or that are in sufficiently close proximity to the antibody such that a mutation can affect binding between the antigen binding protein and antigen can be identified. From a knowledge of these amino acids, the domain(s) or region(s) of the antigen that contain residues in contact with the antigen binding protein or covered by the antibody can be elucidated. Such a domain can include the binding epitope of an antigen binding protein. One specific example of this general approach utilizes an arginine/glutamic acid scanning protocol (see, e.g., Nanevicz, T., et al., 1995<i>, J. Biol. Chem., </i>270:37, 21619-21625 and Zupnick, A., et al., 2006<i>, J. Biol. Chem., </i>281:29, 20464-20473). In general, arginine and glutamic acids are substituted (typically individually) for an amino acid in the wild-type polypeptide because these amino acids are charged and bulky and thus have the potential to disrupt binding between an antigen binding protein and an antigen in the region of the antigen where the mutation is introduced. Arginines that exist in the wild-type antigen are replaced with glutamic acid. A variety of such individual mutants are obtained and the collected binding results analyzed to determine what residues affect binding.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0351">Example 39 describes one such arginine/glutamic acid scanning of PCSK9 for PCSK9 antigen binding proteins provided herein. A series of mutant PCSK9 antigens were created, with each mutant antigen having a single mutation.

A significant alteration in binding indicates that the mutated residue is directly involved in binding to the antigen binding protein or is in close proximity to the binding protein when the binding protein is bound to antigen.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0353">In some embodiments, a significant reduction in binding means that the binding affinity, EC50, and/or capacity between an antigen binding protein and a mutant PCSK9 antigen is reduced by greater than 10%, greater than 20%, greater than 40%, greater than 50%, greater than 55%, greater than 60%, greater than 65%, greater than 70%, greater than 75%, greater than 80%, greater than 85%, greater than 90% or greater than 95% relative to binding between the antigen binding protein and a wild type PCSK9 (e.g., shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or SEQ ID NO: (303). In certain embodiments, binding is reduced below detectable limits. In some embodiments, a significant reduction in binding is evidenced when binding of an antigen binding protein to a variant PCSK9 protein is less than 50% (for example, less than 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15% or 10%) of the binding observed between the antigen binding protein and a wild-type PCSK9 protein (for example, the protein of SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or SEQ ID NO: (303).

In some embodiments, the amount and frequency of administration can take into account the desired cholesterol level (serum and/or total) to be obtained and the subject's present cholesterol level, LDL level, and/or LDLR levels, all of which can be obtained by methods that are well known to those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0407">In certain embodiments, the route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is in accord with known methods, e.g. orally, through injection by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intra-parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, subcutaneously, intra-ocular, intraarterial, intraportal, or intralesional routes; by sustained release systems or by implantation devices. In certain embodiments, the compositions can be administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation device.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0408">In certain embodiments, the composition can be administered locally via implantation of a membrane, sponge or another appropriate material onto which the desired molecule has been absorbed or encapsulated. In certain embodiments, where an implantation device is used, the device can be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of the desired molecule can be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous administration.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0409">In certain embodiments, it can be desirable to use a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, in an ex vivo manner. In such instances, cells, tissues and/or organs that have been removed from the patient are exposed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, after which the cells, tissues and/or organs are subsequently implanted back into the patient.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0410">In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 and/or any additional therapeutic agents can be delivered by implanting certain cells that have been genetically engineered, using methods such as those described herein, to express and secrete the polypeptides. In certain embodiments, such cells can be animal or human cells, and can be autologous, heterologous, or xenogeneic. In certain embodiments, the cells can be immortalized. In certain embodiments, in order to decrease the chance of an immunological response, the cells can be encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. In certain embodiments, the encapsulation materials are typically biocompatible, semi-permeable polymeric enclosures or membranes that allow the release of the protein product(s) but prevent the destruction of the cells by the patient's immune system or by other detrimental factors from the surrounding tissues.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0411">Based on the ability of ABPs to significantly neutralize PCSK9 activity (as demonstrated in the Examples below), these ABPs will have therapeutic effects in treating and preventing symptoms and conditions resulting from PCSK9-mediated activity, such as hypercholesterolemia.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Diagnostic Applications</heading><p id="p-0417" num="0412">In some embodiments, the ABP is used as a diagnostic tool. The ABP can be used to assay the amount of PCSK9 present in a sample and/or subject. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, such ABPs need not be neutralizing ABPs. In some embodiments, the diagnostic ABP is not a neutralizing ABP. In some embodiments, the diagnostic ABP binds to a different epitope than the neutralizing ABP binds to. In some embodiments, the two ABPs do not compete with one another.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0413">In some embodiments, the ABPs disclosed herein are used or provided in an assay kit and/or method for the detection of PCSK9 in mammalian tissues or cells in order to screen/diagnose for a disease or disorder associated with changes in levels of PCSK9. The kit comprises an ABP that binds PCSK9 and means for indicating the binding of the ABP with PCSK9, if present, and optionally PCSK9 protein levels. Various means for indicating the presence of an ABP can be used. For example, fluorophores, other molecular probes, or enzymes can be linked to the ABP and the presence of the ABP can be observed in a variety of ways. The method for screening for such disorders can involve the use of the kit, or simply the use of one of the disclosed ABPs and the determination of whether the ABP binds to PCSK9 in a sample. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, high or elevated levels of PCSK9 will result in larger amounts of the ABP binding to PCSK9 in the sample. Thus, degree of ABP binding can be used to determine how much PCSK9 is in a sample. Subjects or samples with an amount of PCSK9 that is greater than a predetermined amount (e.g., an amount or range that a person without a PCSK9 related disorder would have) can be characterized as having a PCSK9 mediated disorder. In some embodiments, the ABP is administered to a subject taking a statin, in order to determine if the statin has increased the amount of PCSK9 in the subject.</p><p id="p-0419" num="0414">In some embodiments, the ABP is a non-neutralizing ABP and is used to determine the amount of PCSK9 in a subject receiving an ABP and/or statin treatment.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0420" num="0415">The following examples, including the experiments conducted and results achieved, are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">Example 1</heading><heading id="h-0020" level="1">Immunization and Titering</heading><heading id="h-0021" level="2">Generation of Anti-PCSK9 Antibodies and Hybridomas</heading><p id="p-0421" num="0416">Antibodies to the mature form of PCSK9 (depicted as the sequence in FIG. 1A, with the pro-domain underlined), were raised in XenoMouse&#xae; mice (Abgenix, Fremont, Calif.), which are mice containing human immunoglobulin genes. Two groups of XenoMouse&#xae; mice, group 1 and 2, were used to produce antibodies to PCSK9. Group 1 included mice of the XenoMouse&#xae; strain XMG2-KL, which produces fully human IgG2Kand IgG2&#x3bb; antibodies. Group 1 mice were immunized with human PCSK9. PCSK9 was prepared using standard recombinant techniques using the GenBank sequence as reference (NM<sub>&#x2014;</sub>174936). Group 2 involved mice of the XenoMouse&#xae; strain XMG4-KL, which produce fully human IgG4<sub>&#x3ba;</sub> and IgG4&#x3bb; antibodies. Group 2 mice were also immunized with human PCSK9.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0417">The mice of both groups were injected with antigen eleven times, according to the schedule in Table 3. In the initial immunizations, each mouse was injected with a total of 10 &#x3bc;g of antigen delivered intraperitoneally into the abdomen. Subsequent boosts are 5 ug doses and injection method is staggered between intraperitoneal injections into the abdomen and sub-cutaneous injections at the base of the tail. For intraperitoneal injections antigen is prepared as an emulsion with TiterMax&#xae; Gold (Sigma, Cat # T2684) and for subcutaneous injections antigen is mixed with Alum (aluminum phosphate) and CpG oligos. In injections 2 through 8 and 10, each mouse was injected with a total of 5 &#x3bc;g of antigen in the adjuvant alum gel. A final injection of 5 &#x3bc;g of antigen per mouse is delivered in Phospho buffered saline and delivered into 2 sites 50% IP into the abdomen and 50% SQ at the base of tail. The immunization programs are summarized in Table 3, shown below.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>mouse strain</entry><entry>XMG2/kl</entry><entry>XMG4/kl</entry></row><row><entry/><entry># of animals</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>10</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>immunogen</entry><entry>PCSK9-V5/His</entry><entry>PCSK9-V5/His</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>1st boost</entry><entry>IP injection</entry><entry>IP injection</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>10 ug each</entry><entry>10 ug each</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Titermax Gold</entry><entry>Titermax Gold</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>2nd boost</entry><entry>tail injection</entry><entry>tail injection</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5 ug each</entry><entry>5 ug each</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Alum/CpG ODN</entry><entry>Alum/CpG ODN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>3rd boost</entry><entry>IP injection</entry><entry>IP injection</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5 ug each</entry><entry>5 ug each</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Titermax Gold</entry><entry>Titermax Gold</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>4th boost</entry><entry>tail injection</entry><entry>tail injection</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5 ug each</entry><entry>5 ug each</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Alum/CpG ODN</entry><entry>Alum/CpG ODN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>5th boost</entry><entry>IP injection</entry><entry>IP injection</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5 ug each</entry><entry>5 ug each</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Titermax Gold</entry><entry>Titermax Gold</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>6th boost</entry><entry>tail injection</entry><entry>tail injection</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5 ug each</entry><entry>5 ug each</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Alum/CpG ODN</entry><entry>Alum/CpG ODN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>7th boost</entry><entry>IP injection</entry><entry>IP injection</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5 ug each</entry><entry>5 ug each</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Titermax Gold</entry><entry>Titermax Gold</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>8th boost</entry><entry>tail injection</entry><entry>tail injection</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5 ug each</entry><entry>5 ug each</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Alum/CpG ODN</entry><entry>Alum/CpG ODN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>bleed</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>9th boost</entry><entry>IP injection</entry><entry>IP injection</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5 ug each</entry><entry>5 ug each</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Titermax Gold</entry><entry>Titermax Gold</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>10th boost</entry><entry>tail injection</entry><entry>tail injection</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5 ug each</entry><entry>5 ug each</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Alum/CpG ODN</entry><entry>Alum/CpG ODN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>11th boost</entry><entry>BIP</entry><entry>BIP</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5 ug each</entry><entry>5 ug each</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>PBS</entry><entry>PBS</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>harvest</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0424" num="0418">The protocol used to titer the XenoMouse animals was as follows: Costar 3368 medium binding plates were coated with neutravadin @ 8 ug/ml (50 ul/well) and incubated at 4&#xb0; C. in 1XPBS/0.05% azide overnight.

In general, no difference among the different clones of a particular line were detected by the functional assays described herein. In a few cases, clones were identified from a particular line that behaved differently in the functional assays, for example, 25A7.1 was found not to block PCSK9/LDLR but 25A7.3 (referred to herein as 25A7) was neutralizing. The isolated clones were each expanded in 50-100 ml of hybridoma media and allowed to grow to exhaustion, (i.e., less than about 10% cell viability). The concentration and potency of the antibodies to PCSK9 in the supernatants of those cultures were determined by ELISA and by in vitro functional testing, as described herein.

Cells (293 cells for transient expression and CHO cells for stable expression) were transfected with plasmids that encode 16F12 heavy and light chains. Conditioned media from hybridoma cells were recovered by removing cells and cell debris. Clarified conditioned media were loaded onto a Protein A-Sepharose. Optionally, the media can be first concentrated and then loaded onto a Protein A Sepharose column. Non-specific bindings were removed by extensive PBS wash. Bound antibody proteins on the Protein A column were recovered by standard acidic antibody elution from Protein A columns (50 mM Citrate, pH 3.0). Aggregated antibody proteins in the Protein A Sepharose pool were removed by size exclusion chromatography or binding ion exchange chromatography on cation exchanger resin such as SP Sepharose resin.

Each individual anti-PCSK9 antibody was immobilized to a research-grade CM5 biosensor chip by amine-coupling at levels that gave a maximum analyte binding response (Rmax) of no more than 200 resonance units (RU). The concentration of PCSK9 protein was varied at 2 fold intervals (the analyte) and was injected over the immobilized antibody surface (at a flow rate of 100 &#x3bc;l/min for 1.5 minutes).

It is noted that mice transport the majority of serum cholesterol in high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles which is different to humans who carry most serum cholesterol on LDL particles. In mice the measurement of total serum cholesterol most closely resembles the level of serum HDL-C. Mouse HDL contains apolipoprotein E (apoE) which is a ligand for the LDL receptor (LDLR) and allows it to be cleared by the LDLR. Thus, examining HDL is an appropriate indicator for the present example, in mice (with the understanding that a decrease in HDL is not expected for humans). For example, human HDL, in contrast, does not contain apoE and is not a ligand for the LDLR. As PCSK9 antibodies increase LDLR expression in mouse, the liver can clear more HDL and therefore lowers serum HDL-C levels.</p><heading id="h-0061" level="1">Example 14</heading><heading id="h-0062" level="1">Effect of Antibody 31H4 on LDLR Levels in a 6 Day Study</heading><p id="p-0498" num="0482">The present example demonstrates that an antigen binding protein alters the level of LDLR in a subject, as predicted, over time.

SPOTs technology is based on the solid-phase synthesis of peptides in a format suitable for the systematic analysis of antibody epitopes. Synthesis of custom arrayed oligopeptides is commerically available from Sigma-Genosys. A peptide array of overlapping oligopeptides derived from the amino-acid sequence of the PCSK9 peptide can be obtained. The array can comprise a series of 12-mer peptides as spots on a polypropylene membrane sheets. The peptide array can span the entire length of the PCSK9 mature sequence. Each consecutive peptide can be offset by 1 residue from the previous one, yielding a nested, overlapping library of arrayed oligopeptides. The membrane carrying the peptides can be reacted with different anti-PCSK9 antibodies (1 micrograms/ml).

In this process, a combinatorial alanine-scanning strategy can be used to identify amino acids in the PCSK9 protein that are necessary for interaction with anti-PCSK9 ABPs. To accomplish this, a second set of SPOTs arrays can be used for alanine scanning. A panel of variant peptides with alanine substitutions in each of the 12 residues can be scanned as above.

Briefly, amino acid sequences corresponding to the entire variable domains of either V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L </sub>were converted to FASTA formatting for ease in processing comparative alignments and inferring phylogenies. Next, framework regions of these sequences were replaced with an artificial linker sequence (&#x201c;bbbbbbbbbb&#x201d; placeholders, non-specific nucleic acid construct) so that examination of the CDRs alone could be performed without introducing any amino acid position weighting bias due to coincident events (e.g., such as unrelated antibodies that serendipitously share a common germline framework heritage) while still keeping CDRs contiguous within the same sequence corresponding to a V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L</sub>. V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L </sub>sequences of this format were then subjected to sequence similarity alignment interrogation using a program that employs a standard ClutalW-like algorithm (see, Thompson et al., 1994<i>, Nucleic Acids Res. </i>22:4673-4680). A gap creation penalty of 8.0 was employed along with a gap extension penalty of 2.0. This program likewise generated phylograms (phylogenic tree illustrations) based on sequence similarity alignments using either UPGMA (unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages) or Neighbor-Joining methods (see, Saitou and Nei, 1987<i>, Molecular Biology and Evolution </i>4:406-425) to construct and illustrate similarity and distinction of sequence groups via branch length comparison and grouping. Both methods produced similar results but UPGMA-derived trees were ultimately used as the method employs a simpler and more conservative set of assumptions. UPGMA-derived trees were generated where similar groups of sequences were defined as having fewer than 15 substitutions per 100 residues (see, legend in tree illustrations for scale) amongst individual sequences within the group and were used to define consensus sequence collections.

Using this particular virus that expressed human PCSK9, it was determined that 4.5&#xd7;10E12 pfu of virus would result in an LDL-cholesterol level of approximately 40 mg/dL in circulating blood (normal levels of LDL in a WT mice are approximately 10 mg/dL). The human PCSK9 levels in these animals was found to be approximately 13 ug/mL. A colony of mice were generated using this injection criteria.</p><p id="p-0532" num="0514">One week after injection, mice were assessed for LDL-cholesterol levels, and randomized into different treatment groups. Animals were then administered, via tail vein injection, a single bolus injection of either 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg of 16F12, 21B12, or 31H4 antigen binding proteins. IgG2 ABP was administered in a separate group of animals as a dosing control. Subgroups of animals (n=6-7) were then euthanized at 24 and 48 hours after ABP administration. There were no effects on LDL-cholesterol levels following IgG2 administration at either dose. Both 31H4 and 21B12 demonstrated significant LDL-cholesterol lowering up to and including 48 hours post-administration, as compared to IgG2 control (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref> at two different doses). 16F12 shows an intermediary LDL-cholesterol lowering response, with levels returning to baseline of approximately 40 mg/dL by the 48 hour time point. This data is consistent with in vitro binding data (Biacore and Kinexa), which shows near equivalent binding affinity between 31H4 and 21B12, and a lesser affinity of 16F12 to human PCSK9.</p><p id="p-0533" num="0515">As can be seen in the results, total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were reduced by the PCSK9 ABPs in the model (both total and HDL-C are elevated above WT mice due to the overexpression of PCSK9). While cholesterol lowering in this model appears to occur over a relatively short period of time, this is believed to be due to the levels of human PCSK9 that are present, which are supraphysiologically high in this model. In addition, given that the expression is governed by AAV, there is no regulation of PCSK9 expression. In these figures, (*) denotes a P&#x3c;0.05, and (**) denotes a P&#x3c;0.005 as compared to LDL-cholesterol levels observed in IgG2 control injected animals at the same time point. The 13 microgram/ml level of serum human PCSK9 in the mice corresponds to an approximately 520-fold increase above the endogenous mouse PCSK9 levels (25 ng/ml), and an approximately 75-fold increase above average human serum levels (&#x2dc;175 ng/ml). Thus, the antigen binding proteins should be even more effective in humans.</p><p id="p-0534" num="0516">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the above results demonstrate that appropriateness of the mouse model for testing the antigen binding protein's ability to alter serum cholesterol in a subject. One of skill in the art will also recognize that the use of mouse HDL to monitor serum cholesterol levels in a mouse, while useful for monitoring mouse serum cholesterol levels, is not indicative of the ABPs impact on human HDL in humans. For example, Cohen et al. (&#x201c;Sequence variations in PCSK9, low LDL, and protection against coronary heart disease&#x201d;, N Engl J Med, 354:1264-1272, 2006) demonstrated the lack of any effect of the PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations on human HDL levels (the entirety of which is incorporated by reference). Thus, one of skill in the art will appreciate that the ability of the ABP to lower mouse HDL (which lack LDL) is not indicative of the ABP's ability to lower human HDL.

Indeed, the additional structure present on the full length LDLR protein presents additional protein space that can further be blocked by one of the antigen binding molecules. As such, if the antigen binding molecule blocks or inhibits binding of EGFa to PCSK9, it will likely be at least as, if not more, effective with the full length LDLR protein. Similarly, antigen binding molecules that are within a set distance or block various residues that are relevant for inhibiting EGFa binding, will likely be as effective, if not more effective, for the full length LDLR.</p><p id="p-0564" num="0545">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, any molecule that blocks or binds to the above noted PCSK9 residues (or within the recited distances), or that inhibits one or more of the interactions noted in the above examples and figures, can be used to inhibit the interaction of EGFa (or LDLR generally) and PCSK9. As such, the molecule need not be limited to an antigen binding &#x201c;protein,&#x201d; as any antigen binding molecule can also serve the required purpose. Examples of antigen binding molecules include aptamers, which can be either oligonucleic acid or peptide molecules. Other examples of antigen binding molecules include avimers, peptibodies, small molecules and polymers, and modified versions of EGFa that can increase its affinity to PCSK9 and/or half-life, such as mutation of amino acids, glycosylation, pegylation, Fc fusions, and avimer fusions. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in some embodiments LDLR is not an antigen binding molecule. In some embodiments, binding subsections of LDLR are not antigen binding molecules, e.g., EGFa. In some embodiments, other molecules through which PCSK9 signals in vivo are not antigen binding molecules. Such embodiments will be explicitly identified as such.</p><heading id="h-0102" level="1">Example 33</heading><heading id="h-0103" level="1">Expression and Purification of Protein Samples</heading><p id="p-0565" num="0546">The present example describes some embodiments for how the various embodiments of the PCSK9 proteins/variants were made and purified (including the LDLR EGFa domain).

The PCSK9 proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The melittin-His<sub>6 </sub>tag was removed during purification by cleavage with TEV protease. The construct PCSK9 449TEV was used to generate PCSK9 ProCat (31-449) and V domain (450-692) samples.

For the full length N555A variant for crystallography, the PCSK9 31-454 fragment, and the PCSK9 449TEV variant for crystalography, the post rTEV protein product also included an initial GAMG sequence.

Individual bead codes of streptavidin-coated Luminex beads was incubated in 100 ul 0.5 ug/ml biotinylated monovalent mouse-anti-human IgG capture antibody (BD Pharmingen, #555785) for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark, then washed 3&#xd7; with PBSA, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) plus 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Each bead code was separately incubated with 100 ul 2 ug/ml anti-PCSK9 antibody (Coating Antibody) for 1 hour then washed 3&#xd7; with PBSA. The beads were pooled then dispensed to a 96-well filter plate (Millipore, #MSBVN1250). 100 ul of 2 ug/ml purified PCSK9 protein was added to half the wells. Buffer was added to the other half as control. The reaction was incubated for 1 hour then washed. 100 ul of a 2 ug/ml anti-PCSK9 antibody (Detection Ab) was added to all the wells, incubated for 1 hour then washed. An irrelevant human-IgG (Jackson, #009-000-003) was run as another control. 20 ul PE-conjugated monovalent mouse-anti-human IgG (BD Pharmingen, #555787) was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour then washed. Beads were resuspended in 100 ul PBSA and a minimum of 100 events/bead code were collected on the BioPlex instrument (BioRad).</p><p id="p-0598" num="0578">Median Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) of the antibody pair without PCSK9 was subtracted from signal of the corresponding reaction containing PCSK9. For the antibody pair to be considered bound simultaneously, and therefore in different bins, the subtracted signal had to be greater than 3 times the signal of the antibody competing with itself and the 3 times the signal of the antibody competing with the irrelevant antibody.</p><p id="p-0599" num="0579">The data from the above is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A-23D</figref>. The ABPs fell into five bins. The shaded boxes indicate ABPs that can bind simultaneously to PCSK9. The nonshaded boxes indicate those ABPs that compete with each other for binding.

Bin 5, in this example, is presented as a &#x201c;catch all&#x201d; bin to describe those ABPs that do not fit into the other bins. Thus, the above identified ABPs in each of the binds are representative of different types of epitope locations on PCSK9, some of which overlap with each other.</p><p id="p-0602" num="0581">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, if the reference ABP prevents the binding of the probe ABP then the antibodies are said to be in the same bin. The order in which the ABPs are employed can be important. If ABP A is employed as the reference ABP and blocks the binding of ABP B the converse is not always true: ABP B used as the reference ABP will not necessarily block ABP A. There are a number of factors in play here: the binding of an ABP can cause conformational changes in the target which prevent the binding of the second ABP, or epitopes which overlap but do not completely occlude each other may allow for the second ABP to still have enough high-affinity interactions with the target to allow binding. ABPs with a much higher affinity may have a greater ability to bump a blocking ABP out of the way. In general, if competition is observed in either order the ABPs are said to bin together, and if both ABPs can block each other then it is likely that the epitopes overlap more completely.</p><heading id="h-0115" level="1">Example 38</heading><heading id="h-0116" level="1">Epitope Mapping&#x2014;Western Blot</heading><p id="p-0603" num="0582">The present example demonstrates whether or not the epitopes for the examined ABPs were linear or conformational. Denaturing reducing and denaturing non-reducing western blots were run to determine which antibodies have a conformational epitope. Antibodies that bind to a denaturing reducing western blot have a linear epitope and are not conformational. The results are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>. For the blot, 0.5 ug/lane of purified full-length human PCSK9 was run on a 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel and MES SDS Running Buffer. 1 ug/ml anti-PCSK9 antibodies, except 0.5 ug/ml 31G11, were used to probe the blot. 1:5000 donkey-anti-human-IR700 secondary was used and read on a LiCOR instrument. Antibody 13H1 bound to a linear epitope on the pro-domain of PCSK9. All other antibodies displayed results that were consistent with conformational epitopes. These gels split apart the pro-domain from the rest of the protein, and the pro domain ran at about 15 kDa. In addition, 3C4 and 31A4 appeared to bind to conformational epitopes which were preserved by disulfide bonds, as these antibodies bound to PCSK-9 under denaturing conditions where the disulfide bonds had been preserved (left) but reducing the samples (right) eliminated binding.</p><heading id="h-0117" level="1">Example 39</heading><heading id="h-0118" level="1">Epitope Mapping&#x2014;Arginine/Glutamic Acid Scanning</heading><p id="p-0604" num="0583">Representative ABPs from each bin (from Example 37) were selected for further epitope analysis. An arginine/glutamic acid-scanning strategy was performed for mapping ABP binding to PCSK9. By way of background, this method determines if a residue is part of the structural epitope, meaning those residues in the antigen which contact or are buried by the antibody. Arginine and glutamic acid sidechains are charged and bulky and can disrupt antibody binding even if the mutated residue is not directly involved in antibody binding.</p><heading id="h-0119" level="2">Residue Selection</heading><p id="p-0605" num="0584">The crystal structure of PCSK9 was used to select the residues to be mutated for epitope mapping. The method used to choose residues to mutate involved both computational mechanisms and interactive structure analysis. The PCSK9 structure contained gaps of missing residues and was missing 30 amino acids in the N&#x2014;(i.e., the signal sequence) and 10 amino acids in the C-termini. The internal missing residues were modeled onto the structure, but the N- and C-terminal missing residues were not. The solvent exposure ratio for each residue was calculated: the surface area of each residue in the context of the protein (SA1) was divided by the surface area of the residue in a trimer with flanking glycines (SA2) with a conserved backbone structure. Residues with solvent exposure ratio greater than 10% (R10) were selected as well as the 40 missing terminal residues. From these, prolines and glycines with positive &#x3a6; angles were excluded to reduce the possibility of misfolding. The number of residues to be mutated in the V domain was reduced by using a solvent exposure ratio of 37% along with visual inspection of the entire protein to bring the total number of mutations to 285. Various orientations of the surface of PCSK9 with these various classes identifies are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A-25F</figref>. In these figures, lightest gray denotes areas that were not selected or were deselected, darker gray denotes those residues selected).</p><heading id="h-0120" level="2">Cloning and Expression</heading><p id="p-0606" num="0585">Once the residues to be altered were identified, the various residues were altered. Human PCSK9 was cloned into the pTT5 vector with a C-terminal Flag-His tag. Mutants were made from this original construct by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange II kit from Stratagene. Sense and anti-sense oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were designed using Amgen's MutaGenie software. All PCSK9 constructs were expressed in transiently-transfected 293-6E cells in 24-well plates and re-racked into three 96-well plates with a non-mutated PCSK9 control (wild-type, WT) in each plate. Expression levels and integrity of the recombinant proteins in conditioned media were checked by Western blot. Of the 285 mutants originally selected, 41 failed in cloning or expression. 244 mutants were used for epitope mapping. An alignment of the PCSK9 parent sequence and a representative PCSK9 sequence with the 244 mutated residues is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. Separate constructs were made containing a single mutation. For the purposes of the epitope sequences and the epitope based inventions involving changes in binding, the sequences are provided in reference to SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or SEQ ID NO: 303. The sequences in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> were the sequences used for the present binding epitope studies. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the present results apply to other PCSK9 variants disclosed herein as well (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1 and 3, as well as the other allelic variants).</p><p id="p-0607" num="0586">Five antibodies, a representative of each bin, were chosen for fine epitope mapping.

Functional epitopes are generally a subset of the structural epitopes and have those residues that directly contribute to the affinity of the interaction (e.g. hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions). Structural epitopes can be thought of as the patch of the target which is covered by the antibody.</p><p id="p-0609" num="0588">The scanning mutagenesis employed was an arginine and glutamic acid scan. These two sidechains were chosen due to their large steric bulk and their charge, which allows mutations that occur in the structural epitope to have a greater effect on antibody binding. Arginine was generally employed except when the WT reside was arginine, and in these cases the residue was mutated to glutamic acid to switch the charge.</p><p id="p-0610" num="0589">For the purpose of epitope mapping, a bead-based multiplexed assay was used to measure antibody binding to PCSK9 and PCSK9 mutants simultaneously. Antibody binding to mutants was then compared to its binding to the wild-type in the same well. The variants were split into three groups: Group 1: 81 variants+2 wt controls+1 negative control+1 other PCSK9 supernatant; Group 2: 81 variants+2 wt controls+2 negative controls; and Group 3: 82 variants+2 wt control+1 negative control.</p><p id="p-0611" num="0590">The assay was run as follows: 85 sets of color-coded strepavidin-coated LumAvidin beads (Luminex) were bound with biotinylated anti-pentaHis antibody (Qiagen, #1019225) for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) then washed three times in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20. Each color-coded bead set was then allowed to bind to a PCSK9 mutant, wild-type, or negative control in 150 ul supernatant overnight at 4&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0612" num="0591">The color-coded bead sets, each associated to a specific protein, were washed and pooled. At this point, there were 3 pools of 85 bead sets, one pool for each group of mutants and controls. The beads from each pool were aliquoted to 24 wells (3 columns) of a 96-well filter plate (Millipore, #MSBVN1250). 100 ul of anti-PCSK9 antibodies in 4-fold dilutions were added to nine columns for triplicate points and incubated for 1 hour at RT and washed. 100 ul of 1:200 dilution phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc (Jackson Immunoresearch, #109-116-170) was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at RT and washed.</p><p id="p-0613" num="0592">Beads were resuspended in 1% BSA in PBS, shaken for 10 mins and read on the BioPlex instrument (Bio-Rad). The instrument identifies each bead by its color-code thereby identifying the specific protein associated with the color code. At the same time, it measures the amount of antibody bound to the beads by fluorescence intensity of the PE dye. Antibody binding to each mutant can then be compared directly its binding to the wild type in the same pool. IL-17R chimera E was used as a negative control. A summary of all of the mutants examined is shown in Table 39.1 (with reference to the sequence numbering used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 26</figref>).</p><p id="p-0614"

Therefore, the difference between beads regions was due to purely B-B variance and was not confounded by difference between wild type and mutant proteins. The titration of antibody was run with twelve replications in different wells.</p><p id="p-0616" num="0594">The objective of this statistical analysis was to estimate the B-B variability of the estimated EC50 of binding curves. The estimated B-B standard deviation (SD) was then used to build the EC50 confidence intervals of wild type and mutant proteins during curve comparison experiments.</p><p id="p-0617" num="0595">A four-parameter logistic model was fitted to the binding data for each bead region. The resulting file, containing curve quality control (QC) results and parameter estimates for top (max), bottom (min), Hillslope (slope), and natural log of EC50 (xmid) of the curves, was used as the raw data for the analysis. B-B variability for each parameter was then estimated by fitting mixed effect model using SAS PROC MIXED procedure. Only curves with &#x201c;good&#x201d; QC status were included in the analysis. The final mixed effect model included only residual (i.e. individual bead regions) as random effect. Least squares means (LS-mean) for each parameter were estimated by the mixed effect model as well. B-B SD was calculated by taking square root of B-B variance. Fold change between LS-mean +2SD and LS-mean &#x2212;2SD, which represent approximately upper and lower 97.5 percentile of the population, was also calculated. The results are displayed in Table 39.2</p><p id="p-0618" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00019" num="00019"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="266pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 39.2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Least square mean and bead-to-bead variance estimations</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>B-B</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Assay ID</entry><entry>parname</entry><entry>Ls Mean</entry><entry>Variance</entry><entry>&#x2212;2SD</entry><entry>+2SD</entry><entry>Fold Change*</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>PCSK9</entry><entry>max</entry><entry>15000</entry><entry>997719</entry><entry>13002.3</entry><entry>16997.7</entry><entry>1.3</entry></row><row><entry>PCSK9</entry><entry>min</entry><entry>162.09</entry><entry>1919.66</entry><entry>74.5</entry><entry>249.7</entry><entry>3.4</entry></row><row><entry>PCSK9</entry><entry>slope</entry><entry>0.8549</entry><entry>0.000599</entry><entry>0.8</entry><entry>0.9</entry><entry>1.1</entry></row><row><entry>PCSK9</entry><entry>xmid</entry><entry>3.1715</entry><entry>0.002098</entry><entry>3.1</entry><entry>3.3</entry><entry>1.2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="left" id="FOO-00001">*xmid is natural log of the EC50.

This is seen as a shift in the EC50 or a reduction of maximum signal compared to antibody binding to wild type. Statistical analyses of antibody binding curves to wild type and mutants were used to identify statistically significant EC50 shifts. The analysis takes into consideration variation in the assay and curve fitting.</p><p id="p-0620" num="0597">Hit Identification Based on EC50 Comparison</p><p id="p-0621" num="0598">The EC50 and Bmax values were generated from a Weighted 4-Parameter Logistical model fitted to the binding data using S-PLUS with VarPower software (Insightful Corporation, Seattle Wash.). The EC50s of the mutant binding curves and wild type binding curves were compared. Statistically significant differences were identified as hits for further consideration. The curves with &#x201c;nofit&#x201d; or &#x201c;badfit&#x201d; flags were excluded from the analysis.</p><p id="p-0622" num="0599">The Variations in EC50 Estimates</p><p id="p-0623" num="0600">Two sources of variations were considered in the comparison of EC50 estimates, variation from the curve fit and the bead-bead variation. Wild types and mutants were linked to different beads, hence their difference are confounded with the bead-bead difference (described above). The curve fit variation was estimated by the standard error of the log EC50 estimates. Bead-bead variation was experimentally determined using an experiment where wild type controls were linked to each one of the beads (described above). The bead variation in EC50 estimates of wild type binding curve from this experiment was used to estimate the bead-bead variation in the actual epitope mapping experiment.</p><p id="p-0624" num="0601">Testing for EC50 Shift between Mutants and Wild Type</p><p id="p-0625" num="0602">The comparisons of two EC50s (in log scale) was conducted using Student's t-test. The t-statistic was calculated as the ratio between delta (the absolute differences between EC50 estimates) and the standard deviation of delta. The variance of delta was estimated by the sum of the three components, variance estimate of EC50 for mutant and wild type curves in the nonlinear regression and two times the bead-bead variance estimated from a separate experiment. The multiple of two for the bead-bead variance was due to the assumption that both mutant and wild type beads had the same variance. The degree of freedom of the standard deviation of delta was calculated using the Satterthwaite's (1946) approximation. Individual p-values and confidence intervals (95% and 99%) were derived based on Student's t distribution for each comparison. In the case of multiple wild type controls, a conservative approach was taken by picking the wild type control that was most similar to the mutant, i.e., picking the ones with the largest p-values.</p><p id="p-0626" num="0603">Multiplicity adjustments were important to control the false positive(s) while conducting a large number of tests simultaneously. Two forms of multiplicity adjustment were implemented for this analysis: family wise error (FWE) control and false discovery rate (FDR) control. The FWE approach controls the probability that one or more hits are not real; FDR approach controls the expected proportion of false positive among the selected hits. The former approach is more conservative and less powerful than the latter one. There are many methods available for both approaches, for this analysis, the Hochberg's (1988) method for FWE analysis and Benjamini-Hochberg's (1995) FDR method for FDR analysis were selected. Adjusted p-values for both approaches were calculated.</p><p id="p-0627" num="0604">Results</p><p id="p-0628" num="0605">EC50 Shift</p><p id="p-0629" num="0606">Mutations whose EC50 is significantly different from wild type, e.g., having a False Discovery Rate adjusted p-value for the whole assay of 0.01 or less, were considered part of the structural epitope. All the hits also had a Familywise type I error rate adjusted p-value for each antibody of less than 0.01 except residue R185E for antibody 31H4 which had an FWE adjusted p-value per antibody of 0.0109. The residues in the structural epitope of the various antibodies determined by EC50 shift are shown in Table 39.3 (point mutations are with reference to SEQ ID NO: 1 and 303)</p><p id="p-0630"

As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the results presented above are in good agreement with the crystal structures and PCSK-9's binding of these antibodies. This demonstrates that the provided structural and corresponding functional data adequately identifies the key residues and areas of interaction of the neutralizing ABPs and PCSK9. Thus, variants of the ABPs that possess the ability to bind to the above noted areas are adequately provided by the present description.</p><p id="p-0642" num="0616">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, while the B-max drop and EC50 shift hits can be considered manifestations of the same phenomenon, strictly speaking, a B-max drop alone does not reflect a loss of affinity per se but, rather, the destruction of some percentage of the epitope of an antibody. Although there is no overlap in the hits determined by B-max and EC50, mutations with a strong affect on binding may not allow for the generation of a useful binding curve and hence, no EC50 can be determined for such variants.</p><p id="p-0643" num="0617">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, ABPs in the same bin (with the exception of bin 5, which as noted above, is a general catch all bin) likely bind to overlapping sites on the target protein. As such, the above epitopes and relevant residues can generally be extended to all such ABPs in the same bin.</p><p id="p-0644" num="0618">To further examine the above results in regard to ABP 31H4, position E181R, which, according to the above crystal structure, was predicted to interact with R185 to form part of the surface that interacts with the ABP, was also altered (E181R). The results, while not statistically significant on their own, were, when combined with the crystal structure, demonstrative of 31H4 interacting with E181R (data not shown). Thus, position 181 also appears to form part of the epitope for the 31H4 ABP.</p><p id="p-0645" num="0619">As noted above, the above binding data and epitope characterization references a PCSK9 sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) that does not include the first 30 amino acids of PCSK9. Thus, the numbering system of this protein fragment, and the SEQ ID NO:s that refer to this fragment, are shifted by 30 amino acids compared to the data and experiments that used a full length PCSK9 numbering system (such as that used in the crystal study data described above). Thus, to compare these results, an extra 30 amino acids should be added to the positions in each of the above epitope mapping results. For example, position 207 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (or SEQ ID NO: 303), correlates to position 237 of SEQ ID NO: 3 (the full length sequence, and the numbering system used throughout the rest of the specification). Table 39.6 outlines how the above noted positions, which reference SEQ ID NO: 1 (and/or SEQ ID NO: 303) correlate with SEQ ID NO: 3 (which includes the signal sequence).</p><p id="p-0646" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00023" num="00023"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="112pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="105pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 39.6</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>AMINO ACID POSITION IN SEQ</entry><entry>AMINO ACID POSITION IN</entry></row><row><entry>ID NO: 1 (EPITOPE DATA)</entry><entry>SEQ ID NO: 3 (EPITOPE DATA)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="112pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="105pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>207</entry><entry>237</entry></row><row><entry>208</entry><entry>238</entry></row><row><entry>185</entry><entry>215</entry></row><row><entry>181</entry><entry>211</entry></row><row><entry>439</entry><entry>469</entry></row><row><entry>513</entry><entry>543</entry></row><row><entry>538</entry><entry>568</entry></row><row><entry>539</entry><entry>569</entry></row><row><entry>132</entry><entry>162</entry></row><row><entry>351</entry><entry>381</entry></row><row><entry>390</entry><entry>420</entry></row><row><entry>413</entry><entry>443</entry></row><row><entry>582</entry><entry>612</entry></row><row><entry>162</entry><entry>192</entry></row><row><entry>164</entry><entry>194</entry></row><row><entry>167</entry><entry>197</entry></row><row><entry>123</entry><entry>153</entry></row><row><entry>129</entry><entry>159</entry></row><row><entry>311</entry><entry>341</entry></row><row><entry>313</entry><entry>343</entry></row><row><entry>337</entry><entry>367</entry></row><row><entry>519</entry><entry>549</entry></row><row><entry>521</entry><entry>551</entry></row><row><entry>554</entry><entry>584</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0647" num="0620">Thus, those embodiments described herein with reference to SEQ ID NO: 1 can also be described, by their above noted corresponding position with reference to SEQ ID NO: 3.</p><heading id="h-0125" level="1">Example 40</heading><heading id="h-0126" level="1">PCSK9 Domain Binding Assay</heading><p id="p-0648" num="0621">The present example examined where on PCSK9 the various ABPs bound.</p><p id="p-0649" num="0622">Clear, 96 well maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated overnight with 2 ug/ml of various anti-PCSK9 antibodies diluted in PBS.

In other words, such an antigen binding protein will not block PCSK9 from binding to LDLR, but will prevent or reduce PCSK9 mediated LDLR degradation.</p><p id="p-0651" num="0624">Clear, 384 well plates (Costar) were coated with 2 ug/ml of goat anti-LDL receptor antibody (R&#x26;D Systems) diluted in buffer A (100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4). Plates were washed thoroughly with buffer A and then blocked for 2 hours with buffer B (1% milk in buffer A). After washing, plates were incubated for 1.5 hours with 0.4 ug/ml of LDL receptor (R&#x26;D Systems) diluted in buffer C (buffer B supplemented with 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Concurrent with this incubation, 20 ng/ml of biotinylated D374Y PCSK9 was incubated with 100 ng/ml of antibody diluted in buffer A or buffer A alone (control). The LDL receptor containing plates were washed and the biotinylated D374Y PCSK9/antibody mixture was transferred to them and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Binding of the biotinylated D374Y to the LDL receptor was detected by incubation with streptavidin-HRP (Biosource) at 500 ng/ml in buffer C followed by TMB substrate (KPL). The signal was quenched with 1N HCl and the absorbance read at 450 nm. The results are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28C</figref>, which shows that while ABP 31H4 inhibits LDLR binding, ABP 31A4 does not inhibit LDLR binding to PCSK9. In combination with the results from Example 40 and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref>, it is clear that 31A4 ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9 and does not block the interaction of PCSK9 with LDLR.</p><p id="p-0652" num="0625">Next, the Ability of ABP 31A4 to serve as a neutralizing ABP was further confirmed via a cell LDL uptake assay (as described in the examples above).

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28D</figref>, ABP 31A4 displays significant PCSK9 neutralizing ability.
