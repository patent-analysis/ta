level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) is an immunoglobulin-like receptor that is expressed primarily on myeloid lineage cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, osteoclasts, and microglia; and is required for modulation (e.g., suppression) of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, the modulation of inflammatory cytokines, as well as for normal osteoclast development. TREM2 was discovered as a member of the TREM transmembrane glycoproteins, which belong to the single immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain receptor family. The genes encoding human and mouse TREMs map to human chromosome 6p21.1 and mouse chromosome 17C3, respectively. The TREM cluster includes genes encoding TREM1, TREM2, TREM4, and TREM5, as well as the TREM-like genes in both human and mouse. Additionally TREM3 and plasmocytoid dendritic cell (pDC)-TREM were identified in mouse. The TREM-like genes, TREML1 and TREML2 in humans, and Treml1 and Treml2 in mouse, encode TLT-1 and TLT-2 respectively. The two best characterized of these receptors, TREM1 and TREM2, display some sequence homology with other members of the Ig-SF such as activating NK cells receptors (20% identity with NKp44) and act through association with a DAP12-mediated pathway for signaling.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">TREM2 was originally cloned as a cDNA encoding a TREM1 homologue (Bouchon, A et al., J Exp Med, 2001. 194(8): p. 1111-22). This receptor is a glycoprotein of about 40 kDa, which is reduced to 26 kDa after N-deglycosylation. The TREM2 gene encodes a 230 amino acid-length protein that includes an extracellular domain, a transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular region, encoded by exon 2, is composed of a single type V Ig-SF domain, containing three potential N-glycosylation sites. The putative transmembrane region contains a charged lysine residue. The cytoplasmic tail of TREM2 lacks signaling motifs and is thought to signal through the signaling adaptor molecule DAP12/TRYROBP.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The signaling adaptor molecule DAP12 is expressed as a homodimer at the surface of a variety of cells participating in innate immune response, including microglia, macrophages, granulocytes, NK cells, and dendritic cells (DC). DAP12 is a member of the type I transmembrane adapter protein family on the basis of homology with the human T-cell receptor (TCR)-associated CD3 chains and the Fc receptor (FcR) &#x3b3;-chain (Turnbull, I R and Colonna, M, Nat Rev Immunol, 2007. 7(2): p. 155-61). These proteins share many structural and functional characteristics, including one or more ITAM motifs in their cytoplasmic domain, charged acidic residue in transmembrane region (critical for interaction with its partner chain) and the ability to recruit Src homology domain-2 (SH2)-containing proteins following tyrosine phosphorylation. The ITAM motif mediates signal propagation by activation of the ZAP70 or Syk tyrosine kinase. Both kinases phosphorylate several substrates, thereby facilitating the formation of a signaling complex leading to cellular activation. Interestingly, some B-cells and T-cells also express DAP12 under inflammatory conditions. In humans, subsets of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>&#x2212;</sup> T-cells, &#x3b1;&#x3b2;TCR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells expressing this protein have been described in patients suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases, in the context of autoimmune T cells (Schleinitz, N. et al., PLoS ONE, 4 (2009), p. e6264). In view of the significant level of DAP12 expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages, this protein is believed to be expressed in other macrophage-related cells, such as osteoclasts in the bone marrow, Kupffer cells in the liver, alveolar macrophages of the lung, Langerhans cells of skin, and microglial cells in the brain (Takaki, R et al., Immunol Rev, 2006. 214: p. 118-29).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">TREM2 has been identified as expressed on the surface of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and as an mRNA transcript in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264 (Bouchon, A et al., J Exp Med, 2001. 194(8): p. 1111-22). Human TREM2 was the first DAP12-associated receptor described on the surface of DCs. Studies have demonstrated that TREM2 cell surface expression is reduced in DAP12-deficient bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and in DAP12-deficient macrophages, as compared to wild-type cells (Ito, H and Hamerman, J A, Eur J Immunol. 42(1): p. 176-85; Hamerman, J A et al., J Immunol, 2006. 177(4): p. 2051-5; and Hamerman, J A et al., Nat Immunol, 2005. 6(6): p. 579-86). This indicates that formation of the TREM2/DAP12 complex is needed for maximal TREM2 surface expression.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Recent studies have also shown cell-surface expression of TREM2 on macrophages infiltrating tissue from the circulation, as well as on macrophages activated by IL-4 or IL-13 (Turnbull, I R et al., J Immunol, 2006. 177(6): p. 3520-4). However, TREM2 expression was not always found in other cell populations, such as tissue-resident macrophages, circulating monocytes, or the corresponding progenitor cells in the bone marrow, suggesting that TREM2 expression is not induced centrally, but locally during tissue infiltration or by cytokine-mediated activation. Moreover, it has also been observed that IFN-&#x3b3; and LPS reduce or otherwise abrogate TREM2 expression. Further, it has been recently reported that TREM2 is highly expressed on microglia and infiltrating macrophages in the central nervous system during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis or Alzheimer's disease (Piccio, L et al., Eur J Immunol, 2007. 37(5): p. 1290-301; and Wang Y, Cell. 2015 Mar. 12; 160(6):1061-71).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It has been shown that TREM2 signals through DAP12. Downstream this leads to activation of the Syk/Zap70 tyrosine kinase family, PI3K, and other intracellular signals. On myeloid cells, TLR signals are important for activation, such as with infection response, but also play a key role in the pathological inflammatory response, such as with macrophages and dendritic cells (Hamerman, J A et al., (2006) J Immunol 177: 2051-2055; Ito, H et al., Eur J Immunol 42: 176-185; Neumann, H et al., (2007) J Neuroimmunol 184: 92-99; Takahashi, K et al., (2005) J Exp Med 201: 647-657; and Takahashi, K et al., (2007) PLoS Med 4: e124). Deficiency of either TREM2 or DAP12 is thought to lead to increased pro-inflammatory signaling. The impact of TREM2-deficiency in vitro has been shown in the context of stimulation with typical TLR ligands, such as LPS, CpG DNA, and Zymosan. TREM-2-deficient dendritic cells show increased release of IL-12p70, TNF, IL-6, and IL-10 in the presence, but not in the absence of stimulation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Several recent studies have explored the intracellular signaling events induced by the activation of the TREM2/DAP12 pathway. For example, TREM2 is thought to activate signaling pathways involved in cell survival (e.g., protein kinase B-Akt), cell activation and differentiation (e.g., Syk, Erk1/2, PLC-&#x3b3;, etc.), and in the control of the actin cytoskeleton (e.g., Syk, Vav, etc.) (Peng, Q et al., Sci Signal. 3(122): p. ra38; and Whittaker, G C et al., J Biol Chem. 285(5): p. 2976-85). After ligation of TREM2, the ITAM tyrosines in DAP12 are phosphorylated by SRC-family kinases leading to the recruitment and activation of the Syk kinase and/or ZAP70 kinase. In the mouse, Syk may be the predominant kinase involved, whereas in humans both Syk and ZAP70 appear to couple efficiently with such ITAM-containing subunits, binding them through their tandem SH2 domains.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Studies on TREM2 signaling have shown that, like TREM1, TREM2-mediated signaling through DAP12 also leads to an increase in intracellular calcium ion levels and ERK1/2 phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Bouchon, A et al., J Exp Med, 2001. 194(8): p. 1111-22; and Sharif, O and Knapp, S, Immunobiology, 2008. 213(9-10): p. 701-13). Importantly, TREM2 receptor ligation does not induce the degradation of IkB-a and the subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-kB, which points to a possible difference between TREM2 and TREM1 signaling (Bouchon, A et al., J Exp Med, 2001. 194(8): p. 1111-22). Receptor cross-linking of TREM2 on immature dendritic cells triggers the up-regulation of molecules involved in T-cell co-stimulation, such as CD86, CD40, and MHC class II, as well as the up-regulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7 (Bouchon, A et al., J Exp Med, 2001. 194(8): p. 1111-22). TREM2 is also expressed on microglia, where receptor cross-linking results in an increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and CCR7, but not an increase in CD86 or MHC class II expression, suggesting possible cell type-specific differences in TREM2 signaling. Additionally, over-expression of TREM2 in myeloid cells resulted in an increase in phagocytosis of degenerated myelin (Takahashi, K et al., PLoS Med, 2007. 4(4): p. e124; and Neumann, H and Takahashi, K, J Neuroimmunol, 2007. 184(1-2): p. 92-9).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It has also been shown that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) that have been silenced for TREM2 using shRNAi display increased secretion of TNF in response to the TLR2/6 ligand zymosan and the TLR9 ligand CpG, as compared to control BMDM cells that were treated with a non-specific shRNAi, indicating that TREM2 negatively regulates cytokine synthesis in macrophages (Ito, H and Hamerman, J A, Eur J Immunol. 42(1): p. 176-85; Hamerman, J A et al., J Immunol, 2006. 177(4): p. 2051-5; and Hamerman, J A et al., Nat Immunol, 2005. 6(6): p. 579-86). These results have been confirmed using BMDM cells from TREM2 knockout mice, and have further shown that levels of TNF and IL-6 were also higher in TREM2<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> BMDM cells in response to LPS, as compared to wild-type BMDM cells (Turnbull, I R, et al., J Immunol, 2006. 177(6): p. 3520-4; and Turnbull, I R and Colonna, M, Nat Rev Immunol, 2007. 7(2): p. 155-61). Additionally, TREM2 overexpression in microglia has been demonstrated to lead to a decrease in TNF and inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) mRNA after culture of these cells with apoptotic neurons, whereas TREM2 knockdown resulted in a modest increase in TNF and iNOS mRNA levels. This indicates that, in contrast to TREM1, which is a positive regulator of cytokine synthesis, TREM2 is a negative regulator of cytokine synthesis. This effect of TREM2 on inflammation may be independent of the type of macrophage as it occurs in both microglia and BMDM cells.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It has also been shown that in resident myeloid cells of the central nervous system, activation of microglia can lead to inflammation (Neumann, H et al., (2007) J Neuroimmunol 184: 92-99; Takahashi, K et al., (2005) J Exp Med 201: 647-657; Takahashi, K et al., (2007) PLoS Med 4: e124; and Hsieh, C L et al., (2009) J Neurochem 109: 1144-1156). Moreover, microglia activation has also been implicated in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke/ischemic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis. Whereas reduced TREM2 activation leads to increases in certain activation and inflammation markers, such as NOS2 gene transcription in myeloid cells, increased TREM2 activation leads to reduced NOS2 transcription. It is thought that dying neurons express an endogenous ligand for TREM2. HSP60 has been implicated as a ligand of TREM2 on neuroblastoma cells (Stefani, L et al., (2009) Neurochem 110: 284-294). TREM2 over-expression also leads to increased phagocytosis of dying neurons by microglia, and similarly increases phagocytosis by other myeloid lineage cells.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In humans, the complete absence of TREM2 has been shown to cause Nasu-Hakola disease, a rare neurodegenerative disease with late-onset dementia, demyelination, and cerebral atrophy (Paloneva, J et al., (2002) Am J Hum Genet 71: 656-662; and Paloneva, J et al., (2003) J Exp Med 198: 669-675). Nasu-Hakola disease can also be caused by DAP12-deficiency.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">TREM2 gene expression has also been shown to be increased in APP23 transgenic mice, an Alzheimer's disease model in which the mice express a mutant form of the amyloid precursor protein that is associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (Melchior, B et al., ASN Neuro 2: e00037). Uptake of Amyloid 1-42 has also been shown to be increased in BV-2 microglial cell lines that overexpress TREM2.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">TREM2 has further been shown to be upregulated in the EAE mouse model of multiple sclerosis (Neumann, H et al., (2007) J Neuroimmunol 184: 92-99; Takahashi, K et al., (2005) J Exp Med 201: 647-657; and Takahashi, K et al., (2007) PLoS Med 4: e124). The transduction of bone marrow-derived myeloid precursor cells (BM-DC) in vitro with TREM2 leads to increased phagocytosis of degenerated myelin. In response to LPS, these cells show increased IL-10 and decreased IL-1&#x3b2;. Intravenous transplantation of myeloid cells overexpressing TREM2 can suppress EAE in vivo.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, exome sequencing of individuals with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) presentation has identified homozygous mutations in TREM2 (Guerreiro, R J et al., JAMA Neurol 70: 78-84; and Guerreiro, R J et al., Arch Neurol: 1-7). Some of these mutations lead to truncation and likely loss-of-function of TREM2. These same TREM2 mutations can also cause Naku-Hakula disease in some individuals. Imaging analysis in certain individuals with TREM2 homozygous mutations has also shown evidence of demyelination.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Heterozygous mutations in TREM2, which are the same as the mutation that cause Naku-Hakula and FTD, also increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (Guerreiro, R et al., N Engl J Med 368: 117-127; Jonsson, T et al., N Engl J Med 368: 107-116; and Neumann, H et al., N Engl J Med 368: 182-184). Although these TREM2 mutations are rarer than the known risk variants of Alzheimer's disease (e.g., APOE4), the effect of carrying these mutations is just as serious; around a 3 fold increase in the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, even individuals without Alzheimer's disease who carry a heterozygous TREM2 mutation show worse cognition as compared to individuals with two normal TREM2 alleles. Further, it has been shown that the R47H variant of TREM2 (arginine to histidine amino acid substitution at position 47 of TREM2), which is most common TREM2 mutation (up to 1 in 200 individuals) is located within the immunoglobulin domain of TREM2, and may thus alter ligand binding (Wang Y, Cell. 2015 Mar. 12; 160(6):1061-71).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition an integrative network-based approach to rank-ordered organized structure of molecular networks of gene expression for relevance to late onset developing Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) identified TYROBP/DAP12 as the signaling molecule for TREM2 as a key regulator of the immune/microglia gene modules that is associated with LOAD. TYROBP was found to be the causal regulator of the highest scoring immune/microglia module as rank-ordered based on the number of other genes that TREM2 regulated and the magnitude of loss of regulation, as well as differential expression in LOAD brains. TYROBP was significantly upregulated in LOAD brains and there was a progression of TYROBP expression changes across mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which often precedes LOAD (Zhang et al., (2013) Cell 153, 707-720). Targeting such causal networks in ways that restore them to a normal state may be a way to treat disease.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, there is a need for antibodies that specifically bind TREM2 and/or its signaling adapter molecule DAP12/TRYROBP on a cell surface and that modulate (e.g., activate or inhibit) one or more TREM2 and/or DAP12 activities in order to treat one or more diseases, disorders, and conditions associated with decreased TREM2 and/or DAP12 activity, as well as conditions associated with undesired TREM2 and/or DAP12 activity.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, the tumor microenvironment is composed of a heterogeneous immune infiltrate, which include T lymphocytes, macrophages and cells of myeloid/granulocytic lineage. Therapeutic approaches that modulate specific subsets of immune cells are changing the standard of care. &#x201c;Checkpoint blocking&#x201d; antibodies targeting immune-modulatory molecules expressed on T cells (such as CTLA-4 and PD-1) have demonstrated clinical activity across a variety of tumor types (Naidoo-et al., (2014) <i>British Journal of Cancer </i>111, 2214-2219).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Cancer immune-therapy targeting tumor-associated macrophages (e.g., M2-type macrophages) is an intense area of research. The presence of M2-macrophages in tumors is associated with poor prognosis. Accordingly, there is a need for antibodies that specifically bind TREM2 and/or DAP12 and (e.g., activate or inhibit) one or more TREM2 and/or DAP12 activities in tumor-associated immune cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, myeloid/granulocytic cells, T cells, and monocytes.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">All references cited herein, including patent applications and publications, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The invention is generally directed to methods and compositions that include antibodies, e.g., monoclonal antibodies, chimeric antibodies, bispecific antibodies, humanized antibodies, antibody fragments, etc., that specifically bind a TREM2 protein and/or its signaling adaptor molecule DAP12, e.g., a mammalian TREM2, a human TREM2, a mammalian DAP12, or a human DAP12, including wild-type proteins and naturally occurring variants thereof.

An individual having one or more of these risk factors has a higher probability of developing a particular disease, disorder, or condition than an individual without one or more of these risk factors.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As used herein, the term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; refers to clinical intervention designed to alter the natural course of the individual being treated during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include decreasing the rate of progression, ameliorating or palliating the pathological state, and remission or improved prognosis of a particular disease, disorder, or condition. An individual is successfully &#x201c;treated&#x201d;, for example, if one or more symptoms associated with a particular disease, disorder, or condition are mitigated or eliminated.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">An &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; refers to at least an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.

A therapeutically effective amount herein may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the patient, and the ability of the anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As used herein, administration &#x201c;in conjunction&#x201d; with another compound or composition includes simultaneous administration and/or administration at different times.

The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. The pairing of a V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>together forms a single antigen-binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see, e.g., <i>Basic and Clinical Immunology, </i>8th Ed., Daniel P. Stites, Abba I. Terr and Tristram G. Parslow (eds.), Appleton &#x26; Lange, Norwalk, Conn., 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (&#x201c;&#x3ba;&#x201d;) and lambda (&#x201c;&#x3bb;&#x201d;), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains (CH), immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, having heavy chains designated alpha (&#x201c;&#x3b1;&#x201d;), delta (&#x201c;&#x3b4;&#x201d;), epsilon (&#x201c;&#x3b5;&#x201d;), gamma (&#x201c;&#x3b3;&#x201d;) and mu (&#x201c;&#x3bc;&#x201d;), respectively. The &#x3b3; and &#x3b1; classes are further divided into subclasses (isotypes) on the basis of relatively minor differences in the CH sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, and IgA2. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known and described generally in, for example, Abbas et al., Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 4<sup>th </sup>ed. (W.B. Saunders Co., 2000).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">&#x201c;Native antibodies&#x201d; are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (V<sub>H</sub>) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (V<sub>L</sub>) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">An &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; antibody, such as an isolated anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure, is one that has been identified, separated and/or recovered from a component of its production environment (e.g., naturally or recombinantly). Preferably, the isolated polypeptide is free of association with all other contaminant components from its production environment. Contaminant components from its production environment, such as those resulting from recombinant transfected cells, are materials that would typically interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified: (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method, and in some embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight; (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant T-cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, an isolated polypeptide or antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The &#x201c;variable region&#x201d; or &#x201c;variable domain&#x201d; of an antibody, such as an anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure, refers to the amino-terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domains of the heavy chain and light chain may be referred to as &#x201c;V<sub>H</sub>&#x201d; and &#x201c;V<sub>L</sub>&#x201d;, respectively. These domains are generally the most variable parts of the antibody (relative to other antibodies of the same class) and contain the antigen binding sites.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The term &#x201c;variable&#x201d; refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies, such as anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies of the present disclosure. The V domain mediates antigen binding and defines the specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed across the entire span of the variable domains. Instead, it is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three HVRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the HVRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., <i>Sequences of Immunological Interest</i>, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in the binding of antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent-cellular toxicity.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; as used herein refers to an antibody, such as a monoclonal anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure, obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations and/or post-translation modifications (e.g., isomerizations, amidations, etc.) that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler and Milstein., <i>Nature, </i>256:495-97 (1975); Hongo et al., <i>Hybridoma, </i>14 (3):253-260 (1995), Harlow et al., <i>Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual</i>, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2d ed. 1988); Hammerling et al., in: <i>Monoclonal Antibodies and T</i>-<i>Cell Hybridomas </i>563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981)), recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat.

Specifically whole antibodies include those with heavy and light chains including an Fc region. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variants thereof. In some cases, the intact antibody may have one or more effector functions.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">An &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; comprises a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding and/or the variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870, Example 2; Zapata et al., <i>Protein Eng. </i>8(10):1057-1062 (1995)); single-chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Papain digestion of antibodies, such as anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies of the present disclosure, produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called &#x201c;Fab&#x201d; fragments, and a residual &#x201c;Fc&#x201d; fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain (V<sub>H</sub>), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain (C<sub>H</sub>1). Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen-binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having different antigen-binding activity and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. Fab&#x2032; fragments differ from Fab fragments by having a few additional residues at the carboxy terminus of the C<sub>H</sub>1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab&#x2032;-SH is the designation herein for Fab&#x2032; in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab&#x2032; fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy-terminal portions of both H chains held together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region, the region which is also recognized by Fc receptors (FcR) found on certain types of cells.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">&#x201c;Fv&#x201d; is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">&#x201c;Single-chain Fv&#x201d; also abbreviated as &#x201c;sFv&#x201d; or &#x201c;scFv&#x201d; are antibody fragments that comprise the VH and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains, which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of the sFv, see Pl&#xfc;ckthun in <i>The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies</i>, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">&#x201c;Functional fragments&#x201d; of antibodies, such as anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies of the present disclosure, comprise a portion of an intact antibody, generally including the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody or the F region of an antibody which retains or has modified FcR binding capability. Examples of antibody fragments include linear antibody, single-chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The term &#x201c;diabodies&#x201d; refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing sFv fragments (see preceding paragraph) with short linkers (about 5-10) residues) between the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains such that inter-chain but not intra-chain pairing of the V domains is achieved, thereby resulting in a bivalent fragment, i.e., a fragment having two antigen-binding sites. Bispecific diabodies are heterodimers of two &#x201c;crossover&#x201d; sFv fragments in which the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains of the two antibodies are present on different polypeptide chains. Diabodies are described in greater detail in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; Hollinger et al., <i>Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA </i>90:6444-48 (1993).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">As used herein, a &#x201c;chimeric antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody (immunoglobulin), such as a chimeric anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure, in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is(are) identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., <i>Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA, </i>81:6851-55 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include PRIMATIZED&#xae; antibodies wherein the antigen-binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by, e.g., immunizing macaque monkeys with an antigen of interest.

In one embodiment, a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody) in which residues from an HVR of the recipient are replaced by residues from an HVR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity. In some instances, FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance, such as binding affinity. In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin sequence, and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence, although the FR regions may include one or more individual FR residue substitutions that improve antibody performance, such as binding affinity, isomerization, immunogenicity, and the like. The number of these amino acid substitutions in the FR is typically no more than 6 in the H chain, and in the L chain, no more than 3. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.

This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage-display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter, <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>227:381 (1991); Marks et al., <i>J. Mol.

Generally, antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the VH (H1, H2, H3), and three in the VL (L1, L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six HVRs, and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies.

Indeed, naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light chain. See, e.g., Hamers-Casterman et al., <i>Nature </i>363:446-448 (1993) and Sheriff et al., <i>Nature Struct.

The HVRs that are Kabat complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used (Kabat et al., supra). Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>196:901-917 (1987)).

Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy-chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g., residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy-chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a &#x201c;standard&#x201d; Kabat numbered sequence.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">The Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the variable domain (approximately residues 1-107 of the light chain and residues 1-113 of the heavy chain) (e.g., Kabat et al., Sequences of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The &#x201c;EU numbering system&#x201d; or &#x201c;EU index&#x201d; is generally used when referring to a residue in an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (e.g., the EU index reported in Kabat et al., supra). The &#x201c;EU index as in Kabat&#x201d; refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody. References to residue numbers in the variable domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the Kabat numbering system. References to residue numbers in the constant domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the EU numbering system (e.g., see United States Patent Publication No. 2010-280227).</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">An &#x201c;acceptor human framework&#x201d; as used herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework. An acceptor human framework &#x201c;derived from&#x201d; a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence changes. In some embodiments, the number of pre-existing amino acid changes are 10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less. Where pre-existing amino acid changes are present in a VH, preferable those changes occur at only three, two, or one of positions 71H, 73H and 78H; for instance, the amino acid residues at those positions may by 71A, 73T and/or 78A. In one embodiment, the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">A &#x201c;human consensus framework&#x201d; is a framework that represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residues in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al., <i>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, </i>5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991). Examples include for the VL, the subgroup may be subgroup kappa I, kappa II, kappa III or kappa IV as in Kabat et al., supra. Additionally, for the VH, the subgroup may be subgroup I, subgroup II, or subgroup III as in Kabat et al., supra.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">An &#x201c;amino-acid modification&#x201d; at a specified position, e.g., of an anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure, refers to the substitution or deletion of the specified residue, or the insertion of at least one amino acid residue adjacent the specified residue. Insertion &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; to a specified residue means insertion within one to two residues thereof. The insertion may be N-terminal or C-terminal to the specified residue. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">An &#x201c;affinity-matured&#x201d; antibody, such as an affinity matured anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure, is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs thereof that result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody that does not possess those alteration(s). In one embodiment, an affinity-matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity-matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. For example, Marks et al., <i>Bio/Technology </i>10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH- and VL-domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of HVR and/or framework residues is described by, for example: Barbas et al. <i>Proc Nat. Acad. Sci. USA </i>91:3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al. <i>Gene </i>169:147-155 (1995); Yelton et al. <i>J. Immunol. </i>155:1994-2004 (1995); Jackson et al., <i>J.

For example, an antibody, such as an anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure, that specifically or preferentially binds to a target or an epitope is an antibody that binds this target or epitope with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other targets or other epitopes of the target. It is also understood by reading this definition that, for example, an antibody (or a moiety) that specifically or preferentially binds to a first target may or may not specifically or preferentially bind to a second target. As such, &#x201c;specific binding&#x201d; or &#x201c;preferential binding&#x201d; does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding. An antibody that specifically binds to a target may have an association constant of at least about 10<sup>3 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or 10<sup>4 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, sometimes about 10<sup>5 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, in other instances about 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or 10<sup>7 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, about 10<sup>8 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>to 10<sup>9 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, or about 10<sup>10</sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>to 10<sup>11</sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or higher. A variety of immunoassay formats can be used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select monoclonal antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Publications, New York, for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">As used herein, an &#x201c;interaction&#x201d; between a TREM2 protein, or DAP12 protein, and a second protein encompasses, without limitation, protein-protein interaction, a physical interaction, a chemical interaction, binding, covalent binding, and ionic binding. As used herein, an antibody &#x201c;inhibits interaction&#x201d; between two proteins when the antibody disrupts, reduces, or completely eliminates an interaction between the two proteins. An antibody of the present disclosure, or fragment thereof, &#x201c;inhibits interaction&#x201d; between two proteins when the antibody or fragment thereof binds to one of the two proteins.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">An &#x201c;agonist&#x201d; antibody or an &#x201c;activating&#x201d; antibody is an antibody, such as an agonist anti-TREM2 antibody or an agonist anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure, that induces (e.g., increases) one or more activities or functions of the antigen after the antibody binds the antigen.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">An &#x201c;antagonist&#x201d; antibody or a &#x201c;blocking&#x201d; antibody is an antibody, such as an antagonist anti-TREM2 antibody or an antagonist anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure, that reduces or eliminates (e.g., decreases) antigen binding to one or more ligand after the antibody binds the antigen, and/or that reduces or eliminates (e.g., decreases) one or more activities or functions of the antigen after the antibody binds the antigen.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0128">Antibody &#x201c;effector functions&#x201d; refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody, and vary with the antibody isotype.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129">The term &#x201c;Fc region&#x201d; herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain, including native-sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy-chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during production or purification of the antibody, or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly, a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed, antibody populations with no K447 residues removed, and antibody populations having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue. Suitable native-sequence Fc regions for use in the antibodies of the invention include human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">A &#x201c;native sequence Fc region&#x201d; comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature.

Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80% homology with a native sequence Fc region and/or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide, and most preferably at least about 90% homology therewith, more preferably at least about 95% homology therewith.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0132">&#x201c;Fc receptor&#x201d; or &#x201c;FcR&#x201d; describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the Fc&#x3b3;RI, Fc&#x3b3;RII, and Fc&#x3b3;RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors, Fc&#x3b3;RII receptors include Fc&#x3b3;RIIA (an &#x201c;activating receptor&#x201d;) and Fc&#x3b3;RIIB (an &#x201c;inhibiting receptor&#x201d;), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc&#x3b3;RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (&#x201c;ITAM&#x201d;) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc&#x3b3;RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (&#x201c;ITIM&#x201d;) in its cytoplasmic domain. (see, e.g., M. Da&#xeb;ron, <i>Annu. Rev.

Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or MEGALIGN&#x2122; (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms known in the art needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">An &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; nucleic acid molecule encoding an antibody, such as an anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure, is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the environment in which it was produced. Preferably, the isolated nucleic acid is free of association with all components associated with the production environment. The isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding the polypeptides and antibodies herein is in a form other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from nucleic acid encoding the polypeptides and antibodies herein existing naturally in cells.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">The term &#x201c;vector,&#x201d; as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a &#x201c;plasmid,&#x201d; which refers to a circular double stranded DNA into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as &#x201c;recombinant expression vectors,&#x201d; or simply, &#x201c;expression vectors.&#x201d; In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, &#x201c;plasmid&#x201d; and &#x201c;vector&#x201d; may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">&#x201c;Polynucleotide,&#x201d; or &#x201c;nucleic acid,&#x201d; as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may comprise modification(s) made after synthesis, such as conjugation to a label. Other types of modifications include, for example, &#x201c;caps,&#x201d; substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotides(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid or semi-solid supports. The 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2&#x2032;-O-methyl-, 2&#x2032;-O-allyl-, 2&#x2032;-fluoro- or 2&#x2032;-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, a-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs, and basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S (&#x201c;thioate&#x201d;), P(S)S (&#x201c;dithioate&#x201d;), (O)NR2 (&#x201c;amidate&#x201d;), P(O)R, P(O)OR&#x2032;, CO, or CH2 (&#x201c;formacetal&#x201d;), in which each R or R&#x2032; is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (&#x2014;O&#x2014;) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl.

In some embodiments, it is believed that anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies can induce or retain TREM2 receptor clustering in vivo by not only binding specifically to TREM2, but by also binding to Fc receptors on adjacent cells, which leads to antibody aggregation that in turn aggregates TREM2. Advantageously, certain immunoglobulin isotypes, including without limitation, IgG2 and IgM, have an intrinsic ability to induce or retain clustering of target antigens (e.g., TREM2) without binding Fc receptors on adjacent cells. In some embodiments, agonistic TREM2 activities can be determined or tested in vitro by any of several techniques disclosed herein (see, e.g., Examples 23-26, 34-37, 41-44, 52-55, and 67-68), including, without limitation, plate-binding full-length anti-TREM2 antibodies to increase the density of antibodies exposed to TREM2 and cross-linking anti-TREM2 antibodies.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0145">Accordingly, certain aspects of the present disclosure are based, at least in part, on the identification of anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies that are capable of binding to both human and mouse TREM2 with high affinity (see, e.g., Examples land 40); that compete with TREM2-ligand for binding to the ligand-binding site on human and mouse TREM2 (see, e.g., Examples 26 and 43); and that exhibit one or more agonistic TREM2 activities, including, without limitation, induction of CD83<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (see, e.g., Examples 23 and 41), induction of the TREM2 downstream signaling molecule Syk in macrophages and dendritic cells (see, e.g., Examples 24 and 42), induction of the TREM2 signaling adaptor molecule DAP12 in macrophages (see, e.g., Examples 25 and 44), induction of cell survival of innate immune cells, such as macrophages (see, e.g., Examples 34 and 52), and activation of TREM2-dependent gene expression (see, e.g., Examples 36, 38, 54, 56, and 68).</p><p id="p-0148" num="0146">Further aspects of the present disclosure are based, at least in part, on the surprising discovery that the anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies of the present disclosure can also induce antagonistic activities when the antibody is produced or otherwise formatted such that it is incapable of inducing or retaining TREM2 receptor clustering.

One class of antibodies is agonist antibodies. For example, the TREM2 receptor is thought to require clustering on the cell surface in order to transduce a signal. Thus agonist antibodies may have unique features to stimulate, for example, the TREM2 receptor. For example, they may have the correct epitope specificity that is compatible with receptor activation, as well as the ability to induce or retain receptor clustering on the cell surface.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0164">In vivo, antibodies may cluster receptors by multiple potential mechanisms. Some isotypes of human antibodies such as IgG2 have, due to their unique structure, an intrinsic ability to cluster receptors, or retain receptors in a clustered configuration, thereby activating receptors such as TREM2 without binding to an Fc receptor (e.g., White et al., (2015) <i>Cancer Cell </i>27, 138-148).</p><p id="p-0169" num="0165">Other antibodies cluster receptors (e.g., TREM2) by binding to Fcg receptors on adjacent cells. Binding of the constant IgG Fc part of the antibody to Fcg receptors leads to aggregation of the antibodies, and the antibodies in turn aggregate the receptors to which they bind through their variable region (Chu et al (2008) Mol Immunol, 45:3926-3933; and Wilson et al., (2011) Cancer Cell 19, 101-113). Binding to the inhibitory Fcg receptor FcgR (FcgRIIB) that does not elicit cytokine secretion, oxidative burst, increased phagocytosis, and enhanced antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is often a preferred way to cluster antibodies in vivo, since binding to FcgRIIB is not associated with immune adverse effects.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0166">Other mechanisms may also be used to cluster receptors (e.g., TREM2). For example, antibody fragments (e.g., Fab fragments) that are cross-linked together may be used to cluster receptors (e.g., TREM2) in a manner similar to antibodies with Fc regions that bind Fcg receptors, as described above. Without wishing to be bound to theory, it is thought that cross-linked antibody fragments (e.g., Fab fragments) may function as agonist antibodies if they induce receptor clustering on the cell surface and bind an appropriate epitope on the target (e.g., TREM2).</p><p id="p-0171" num="0167">Therefore, in some embodiments, antibodies that bind a TREM2 protein and/or a DAP12 protein may include agonist antibodies that due to their epitope specificity bind TREM2 and/or DAP12 and activate one or more TREM2 and/or DAP12 activities. Without wishing to be bound to theory, such antibodies may bind to the ligand-binding site on the target antigen (e.g., TREM2 and/or DAP12) and mimic the action of a natural ligand, or stimulate the target antigen to transduce signal by binding to one or more domains that are not the ligand-binding sites. Such antibodies would not interfere with ligand binding and may act additively or synergistically with the natural ligands.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0168">In some embodiments, an antibody of the present disclosure is an agonist antibody that induces one or more TREM2 activities, one or more DAP12 activities, or one or more TREM2 activities and one or more DAP12 activities. In some embodiments the antibody induces one or more activities of TREM2 and/or DAP12 after binding to a TREM2 and/or DAP12 protein that is expressed in a cell. In certain embodiments, the one or more TREM2 activities, the one or more DAP12 activities, or both are selected from TREM2 binding to DAP12; DAP12 binding to TREM2; DAP12 phosphorylation; TREM2 phosphorylation; PI3K activation; increased expression of one or more anti-inflammatory cytokines, increased expression of one or more anti-inflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines) selected from IL-12p70, IL-6, and IL-10; reduced expression of one or more pro-inflammatory cytokines; reduced expression of one or more pro-inflammatory mediators selected from the group consisting of IFN-a4, IFN-b, IL-6, IL-12 p70, IL-1&#x3b2;, TNG, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-10, IL-8, CRP, TGF-beta members of the chemokine protein families, IL-20 family members, IL-33, LIF, IFN-gamma, OSM, CNTF, TGF-beta, GM-CSF, IL-11, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, mCP-1, and CRP; reduced expression of TNF-&#x3b1;; reduced expression of IL-6; extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation; increased expression of C-C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7); induction of microglial cell chemotaxis toward CCL19 and CCL21 expressing cells; an enhancement, normalization, or both of the ability of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to induce antigen-specific T-cell proliferation; induction of osteoclast production, increased rate of osteoclastogenesis, or both; increasing the survival and/or function of one or more of macrophages, microglial cells, M1 macrophages and/or microglial cells, activated M1 macrophages and/or microglial cells, M2 macrophages and/or microglial cells, monocytes, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, and Kupffer cells; induction of one or more types of clearance selected from apoptotic neuron clearance, nerve tissue debris clearance, non-nerve tissue debris clearance, bacteria or other foreign body clearance, disease-causing protein clearance, disease-causing peptide clearance, and disease-causing nucleic acid clearance; induction of phagocytosis of one or more of apoptotic neurons, nerve tissue debris, non-nerve tissue debris, bacteria, other foreign bodies, disease-causing proteins, disease-causing proteins, disease-causing peptides, or disease-causing nucleic acids (e.g., antisense GGCCCC (G2C4) repeat-expansion RNA); normalization of disrupted TREM2/DAP12-dependent gene expression; recruitment of Syk, ZAP70, or both to a DAP12/TREM2 complex; Syk phosphorylation; increased expression of CD83 and/or CD86 on dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, and/or microglia; reduced secretion of one or more inflammatory cytokines; reduced secretion of one or more inflammatory cytokines selected from TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-10, IL-6, MCP-1, FN-a4, IFN-b, IL-1&#x3b2;.

As used herein, &#x201c;inert&#x201d; antibodies refer to antibodies that specifically bind their target antigen but do not modulate (e.g., decrease/inhibit or activate/induce) antigen function. For example, in the case of TREM2, inert antibodies do not modulate ligand binding and/or TREM2 activities. Without wishing to be bound to theory, it is thought that antibodies that do not have the ability to cluster TREM2 on the cell surface may be inert antibodies even if they have an epitope specificity that is compatible with receptor activation.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0184">In some embodiments, antibodies that bind a TREM2 protein and/or a DAP12 protein may include antibodies that bind TREM2 and/or DAP12 but, due to their epitope specificity, do not modulate protein function. Such functionally inert antibodies can be used as cargo to transport toxins as described for the CD33 antibody Gemtuzumab zogamicin, (marketed as Mylotarg) which is conjugated to the cytotoxic agent from the class of calicheamicins and is used to target and kill acute myelogenous leukemia tumors (Naito et al., (2000), <i>Leukemia, </i>14, 1436-1443; Ricart (2011) <i>Clin Cancer Res </i>17; 6417-6436; Hamann et al., (2002) <i>Journal: Bioconjugate Chemistry, </i>13, 47-58; and Beitz et al., (2001) <i>Clin Cancer Res </i>7; 1490-6.). Therefore, in some embodiments, antibodies of the present disclosure are inert antibodies that bind TREM2 and/or DAP12 but are incapable of inducing one or more TREM2 activities (e.g., a TREM2 activity described herein) and/or DAP12 activities (e.g., a DAP12 activity described herein).</p><p id="p-0190" num="0185">Exemplary inert antibody Fc isotypes and modifications are provided in Table 3 below. In some embodiments, the inert antibody has an Fc isotype listed in Table 3 below.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0186">Antagonist Antibodies</p><p id="p-0192" num="0187">A third class of antibodies of the present disclosure includes antagonist antibodies. In some embodiments, antibodies that bind a TREM2 protein and/or a DAP12 protein may include antagonist antibodies that bind TREM2 and/or DAP12 and inhibit one or more TREM2 activities and/or DAP12 activities, either by preventing interaction between TREM2 and/or DAP12 and its ligand(s), or by preventing the transduction of signal from the extracellular domain of TREM2 and/or DAP12 into the cell cytoplasm in the presence of ligand. In some embodiments, antagonist antibodies of the present disclosure may have the epitope specificity of an agonist antibody of the present disclosure, but have an Fc domain that is not capable of binding Fcg receptors and thus is unable to, for example, cluster DAP12 and/or the TREM2 receptor.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0188">In some embodiments, an antibody of the present disclosure is an antagonist antibody. In some embodiments, the antagonist antibody inhibits one or more TREM2 and/or DAP12 activities. In some embodiments, the antagonist antibody decreases activity of one or more TREM2-dependent genes. In some embodiments, the one or more TREM2-dependent genes include, without limitation, one or more nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) transcription factors. In some embodiments, the antagonist antibody decreases the survival of macrophages, microglial cells, M1 macrophages, M1 microglial cells, M2 macrophages, M2 microglial cells, osteoclasts, Langerhans cells of skin, Kupffer cells, and/or dendritic cell. In some embodiments, the antagonist antibody inhibits interaction between TREM2 and/or DAP12 and one or more TREM2 and/or DAP12 ligands. In some embodiments, the antagonist antibody inhibits TREM2 and/or DAP12 signal transduction. In some embodiments, the antagonist antibody inhibits interaction between TREM2 and/or DAP12 and one or more TREM2 and/or DAP12 ligands and inhibits TREM2 and/or DAP12 signal transduction.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0189">In some embodiments, antibody cross-linking is required for agonist antibody function. Antibody cross-linking can occur through binding to a secondary antibody in vitro or through binding to Fc receptors in vivo. For example, antagonistic antibodies can be converted to agonistic antibodies via biotin/streptavidin cross-linking or secondary antibody binding in vitro (see for example Gravestein et al., (1996) <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>184:675-685; Gravestein et al., (1994) <i>International Immunol. </i>7:551-557). Agonistic antibodies may exert their activity by mimicking the biological activity of the receptor ligand or by enhancing receptor aggregation, thereby activating receptor signaling. In some embodiments, the absence of antibody cross-linking is required for antagonistic activity. Antagonistic antibodies may exert their activity by blocking receptor-ligand interactions.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0190">Exemplary antagonist antibody Fc isotypes and modifications are provided in Table 3 below.

The second antibody may be present in a hybridoma supernatant. As a control, immobilized TREM2 or cells expressing TREM2 is incubated in a solution comprising the first labeled antibody but not the second unlabeled antibody. After incubation under conditions permissive for binding of the first antibody to TREM2, excess unbound antibody is removed, and the amount of label associated with immobilized TREM2 or cells expressing TREM2 is measured. If the amount of label associated with immobilized TREM2 or cells expressing TREM2 is substantially reduced in the test sample relative to the control sample, then that indicates that the second antibody is competing with the first antibody for binding to TREM2.

Microglial cells constitute 20% of the total glial cell population within the brain. Microglial cells are constantly scavenging the CNS for plaques, damaged neurons and infectious agents. The brain and spinal cord are considered &#x201c;immune privileged&#x201d; organs in that they are separated from the rest of the body by a series of endothelial cells known as the blood-brain barrier, which prevents most infections from reaching the vulnerable nervous tissue. In the case where infectious agents are directly introduced to the brain or cross the blood-brain barrier, microglial cells must react quickly to decrease inflammation and destroy the infectious agents before they damage the sensitive neural tissue. Due to the unavailability of antibodies from the rest of the body (few antibodies are small enough to cross the blood brain barrier), microglia must be able to recognize foreign bodies, swallow them, and act as antigen-presenting cells activating T-cells. Since this process must be done quickly to prevent potentially fatal damage, microglial cells are extremely sensitive to even small pathological changes in the CNS.

No. 4,816,567).</p><p id="p-0334" num="0328">In the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized as hereinabove described to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization (e.g., a purified or recombinant TREM2 and/or DAP12 protein of the present disclosure). Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, <i>Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice</i>, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)).</p><p id="p-0335" num="0329">The immunizing agent will typically include the antigenic protein (e.g., a purified or recombinant TREM2 and/or DAP12 protein of the present disclosure) or a fusion variant thereof. Generally peripheral blood lymphocytes (&#x201c;PBLs&#x201d;) are used if cells of human origin are desired, while spleen or lymph node cells are used if non-human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphoctyes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell. Goding, <i>Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice</i>, Academic Press (1986), pp. 59-103.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0330">Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, bovine or human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which are substances that prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient-cells.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0331">Preferred immortalized myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors (available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA), as well as SP-2 cells and derivatives thereof (e.g., X63-Ag8-653) (available from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. USA). Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines have also been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, <i>J. Immunol., </i>133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., <i>Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications</i>, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).</p><p id="p-0338" num="0332">Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen (e.g., a TREM2 and/or DAP12 protein of the present disclosure).

Preferably, the binding affinity and specificity of the monoclonal antibody can be determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the in art. For example, binding affinity may be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al., <i>Anal. Biochem., </i>107:220 (1980).</p><p id="p-0340" num="0334">After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, supra). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as tumors in a mammal.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0335">The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, affinity chromatography, and other methods as described above.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0336">Anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567, and as described above. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that specifically bind to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host-cells such as <i>E. coli </i>cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, in order to synthesize monoclonal antibodies in such recombinant host-cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al., <i>Curr. Opin. Immunol., </i>5:256-262 (1993) and Pl&#xfc;ckthun, <i>Immunol. Rev. </i>130:151-188 (1992).</p><p id="p-0343" num="0337">In certain embodiments, anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al., <i>Nature, </i>348:552-554 (1990). Clackson et al., <i>Nature, </i>352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. <i>Mol. Biol., </i>222:581-597 (1991) described the isolation of murine and human antibodies, respectively, from phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity (nanomolar (&#x201c;nM&#x201d;) range) human antibodies by chain shuffling (Marks et al., <i>Bio/Technology, </i>10:779-783 (1992)), as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries (Waterhouse et al., <i>Nucl. Acids Res., </i>21:2265-2266 (1993)). Thus, these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies of desired specificity (e.g., those that bind a TREM2 protein of the present disclosure).</p><p id="p-0344" num="0338">The DNA encoding antibodies or fragments thereof may also be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy- and light-chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison, et al., <i>Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, </i>81:6851 (1984)), or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Typically such non-immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant domains of an antibody, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different antigen.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0339">The monoclonal antibodies described herein (e.g., anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies of the present disclosure or fragments thereof) may by monovalent, the preparation of which is well known in the art. For example, one method involves recombinant expression of immunoglobulin light chain and a modified heavy chain. The heavy chain is truncated generally at any point in the Fc region so as to prevent heavy chain crosslinking. Alternatively, the relevant cysteine residues may be substituted with another amino acid residue or are deleted so as to prevent crosslinking. In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibodies to produce fragments thereof, particularly Fab fragments, can be accomplished using routine techniques known in the art.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0340">Chimeric or hybrid anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies also may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide-exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0341">(3) Humanized Antibodies</p><p id="p-0348" num="0342">Anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies of the present disclosure or antibody fragments thereof may further include humanized or human antibodies. Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fab, Fab&#x2032;-SH, Fv, scFv, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementarity determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Jones et al., <i>Nature </i>321: 522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., <i>Nature </i>332: 323-329 (1988) and Presta, <i>Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. </i>2: 593-596 (1992).</p><p id="p-0349" num="0343">Methods for humanizing non-human anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as &#x201c;import&#x201d; residues, which are typically taken from an &#x201c;import&#x201d; variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers, Jones et al., <i>Nature </i>321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., <i>Nature </i>332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., <i>Science </i>239:1534-1536 (1988), or through substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0344">The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called &#x201c;best-fit&#x201d; method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework (FR) for the humanized antibody. Sims et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>151:2296 (1993); Chothia et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>196:901 (1987). Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies. Carter et al., <i>Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA </i>89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., <i>J. Immunol. </i>151:2623 (1993).</p><p id="p-0351" num="0345">Furthermore, it is important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analyzing the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen or antigens (e.g., TREM2 proteins of the present disclosure), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0346">Various forms of the humanized anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody are contemplated. For example, the humanized anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody may be an antibody fragment, such as an Fab, which is optionally conjugated with one or more TREM2 ligand, such as HSP60. Alternatively, the humanized anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody may be an intact antibody, such as an intact IgG1 antibody.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0347">(4) Human Antibodies</p><p id="p-0354" num="0348">Alternatively, human anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies can be generated. For example, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. The homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (J<sub>H</sub>) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., <i>Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA, </i>90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., <i>Nature, </i>362:255-258 (1993); Bruggermann et al., <i>Year in Immunol., </i>7:33 (1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,669 and WO 97/17852.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0349">Alternatively, phage display technology can be used to produce human anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. McCafferty et al., <i>Nature </i>348:552-553 (1990); Hoogenboom and Winter, <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>227: 381 (1991). According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats, reviewed in, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S. and Chiswell, David <i>J., Curr. Opin Struct. Biol. </i>3:564-571 (1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al., <i>Nature </i>352:624-628 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>222:581-597 (1991), or Griffith et al., <i>EMBO J. </i>12:725-734 (1993). See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,332 and 5,573,905. Additionally, yeast display technology can be used to produce human anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro (e.g., WO 2009/036379; WO 2010/105256; WO 2012/009568; US 2009/0181855; US 2010/0056386; and Feldhaus and Siegel (2004) J Immunological Methods 290:69-80). In other embodiments, ribosome display technology can be used to produce human anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro (e.g., Roberts and Szostak (1997) Proc Natl Acad Sci 94:12297-12302; Schaffitzel et al. (1999) J. Immunolical Methods 231:119-135; Lipovsek and Pl&#xfc;ckthun (2004) J Immunological Methods 290:51-67).</p><p id="p-0356" num="0350">The techniques of Cole et al., and Boerner et al., are also available for the preparation of human anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985) and Boerner et al., <i>J. Immunol. </i>147(1): 86-95 (1991). Similarly, human anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies can be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon challenge, human antibody production is observed, which closely resembles that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly and antibody repertoire. This approach is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806, 5,569,825, 5,625,126, 5,633,425, 5,661,016 and in the following scientific publications: Marks et al., <i>Bio/Technology </i>10: 779-783 (1992); Lonberg et al., <i>Nature </i>368: 856-859 (1994); Morrison, <i>Nature </i>368: 812-13 (1994), Fishwild et al., <i>Nature Biotechnology </i>14: 845-51 (1996), Neuberger, <i>Nature Biotechnology </i>14: 826 (1996) and Lonberg and Huszar, <i>Intern. Rev. Immunol. </i>13: 65-93 (1995).</p><p id="p-0357" num="0351">Finally, human anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies may also be generated in vitro by activated B-cells (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,567,610 and 5,229,275).</p><p id="p-0358" num="0352">(5) Antibody Fragments</p><p id="p-0359" num="0353">In certain embodiments there are advantages to using anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody fragments, rather than whole anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies. In some embodiments, smaller fragment sizes allow for rapid clearance and better brain penetration.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0354">Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., <i>J. Biochem. Biophys. Method. </i>24:107-117 (1992); and Brennan et al., <i>Science </i>229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host-cells, for example, using nucleic acids encoding anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies of the present disclosure. Fab, Fv and scFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from <i>E. coli</i>, thus allowing the straightforward production of large amounts of these fragments. Anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody fragments can also be isolated from the antibody phage libraries as discussed above. Alternatively, Fab&#x2032;-SH fragments can be directly recovered from <i>E. coli </i>and chemically coupled to form F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments (Carter et al., <i>Bio/Technology </i>10:163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host-cell culture. Production of Fab and F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>antibody fragments with increased in vivo half-lives are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,046. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See WO 93/16185; U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,894 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,458. The anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody fragment may also be a &#x201c;linear antibody,&#x201d; e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0355">(6) Bispecific and Polyspecific Antibodies</p><p id="p-0362" num="0356">Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes, including those on the same or another protein (e.g., one or more TREM2 proteins of the present disclosure). Alternatively, one part of a BsAb can be armed to bind to the target TREM2 and/or DAP12 antigen, and another can be combined with an arm that binds to a second protein. Such antibodies can be derived from full-length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>bispecific antibodies).</p><p id="p-0363" num="0357">Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full-length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy-chain/light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities. Millstein et al., <i>Nature, </i>305:537-539 (1983). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829 and in Traunecker et al., <i>EMBO J., </i>10:3655-3659 (1991).</p><p id="p-0364" num="0358">According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, C<sub>H</sub>2, and C<sub>H</sub>3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (C<sub>H</sub>1) containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0359">In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only half of the bispecific molecules provides for an easy way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94/04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies, see, for example, Suresh et al., <i>Methods in Enzymology </i>121: 210 (1986); and Garber, <i>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery </i>13, 799-801 (2014).</p><p id="p-0366" num="0360">According to another approach described in WO 96/27011 or U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant-cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C<sub>H</sub>3 region of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g., tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory &#x201c;cavities&#x201d; of identical or similar size to the large side chains(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g., alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0361">Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., <i>Science </i>229:81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytic ally cleaved to generate F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab&#x2032; fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab&#x2032;-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab&#x2032;-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0362">Fab&#x2032; fragments may be directly recovered from <i>E. coli </i>and chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>175: 217-225 (1992) describes the production of fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>molecules. Each Fab&#x2032; fragment was separately secreted from <i>E. coli </i>and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T-cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0363">Various techniques for making and isolating bivalent antibody fragments directly from recombinant-cell culture have also been described. For example, bivalent heterodimers have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab&#x2032; portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. The &#x201c;diabody&#x201d; technology described by Hollinger et al., <i>Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA, </i>90: 6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific/bivalent antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (V<sub>H</sub>) connected to a light-chain variable domain (V<sub>L</sub>) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary V<sub>L </sub>and V<sub>H </sub>domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific/bivalent antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>152:5368 (1994).</p><p id="p-0370" num="0364">Another method to generate bispecific antibodies is controlled Fab-arm exchange (cFAE), which is an easy-to-use method to generate bispecific IgG1 (bsIgG1). The protocol involves the following: (i) separate expression of two parental IgG1s containing single matching point mutations in the CH3 domain; (ii) mixing of parental IgG1s under permissive redox conditions in vitro to enable recombination of half-molecules; (iii) removal of the reductant to allow reoxidation of interchain disulfide bonds; and (iv) analysis of exchange efficiency and final product using chromatography-based or mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods. The protocol generates bsAbs with regular IgG architecture, characteristics and quality attributes both at bench scale (micrograms to milligrams) and at a mini-bioreactor scale (milligrams to grams) that is designed to model large-scale manufacturing (kilograms). Starting from good-quality purified proteins, exchange efficiencies of &#x2267;95% can be obtained within 2-3 days (including quality control).

For example, the Fc receptor binding site on the constant region may be modified or mutated to remove or reduce binding affinity to certain Fc receptors, such as Fc&#x3b3;RI, Fc&#x3b3;RII, and/or Fc&#x3b3;RIII (e.g., to reduce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In some embodiments, the effector function is impaired by removing N-glycosylation of the Fc region (e.g., in the CH 2 domain of IgG) of the antibody. In some embodiments, the effector function is impaired by modifying regions such as 233-236, 297, and/or 327-331 of human IgG as described in PCT WO 99/58572 and Armour et al., <i>Molecular Immunology </i>40: 585-593 (2003); Reddy et al., <i>J.

In some embodiments, it may also be desirable to modify an anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure to modify effector function to increase selectivity toward the ITIM-containing FcgRIIb (CD32b) to increase clustering of antibodies on adjacent cells without activating humoral responses including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0371">To increase the serum half-life of the antibody, one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody (especially an antibody fragment) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277, for example. As used herein, the term &#x201c;salvage receptor binding epitope&#x201d; refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgG<sub>1</sub>, IgG<sub>2</sub>, IgG<sub>3</sub>, or IgG<sub>4</sub>) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0372">(9) Other Amino Acid Sequence Modifications</p><p id="p-0379" num="0373">Amino acid sequence modifications of anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies of the present disclosure, or antibody fragments thereof, are also contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibodies or antibody fragments. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibodies or antibody fragments are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the nucleic acid encoding the antibodies or antibody fragments, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics (i.e., the ability to bind or physically interact with a TREM2 and/or DAP12 protein of the present disclosure). The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0374">A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called &#x201c;alanine scanning mutagenesis&#x201d; as described by Cunningham and Wells in <i>Science, </i>244:1081-1085 (1989). Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with the target antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, alanine scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.</p><p id="p-0381" num="0375">Amino acid sequence insertions include amino-(&#x201c;N&#x201d;) and/or carboxy-(&#x201c;C&#x201d;) terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0376">Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue.

Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment, such as an Fv fragment).</p><p id="p-0393" num="0386">A particularly preferred type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (e.g., 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g., binding affinity) as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and the antigen (e.g., a TREM2 protein of the present disclosure). Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0387">Another type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original glycosylation pattern of the antibody. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0388">Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.</p><p id="p-0396" num="0389">Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).</p><p id="p-0397" num="0390">Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the anti-IgE antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibodies (e.g., anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies of the present disclosure) or antibody fragments.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0391">(10) Other Antibody Modifications</p><p id="p-0399" num="0392">Anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies of the present disclosure, or antibody fragments thereof, can be further modified to contain additional non-proteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available, or to contain different types of drug conjugates that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably, the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water-soluble polymers. Non-limiting examples of water-soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1, 3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol homopolymers, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one polymer is attached, they can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and/or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions, etc. Such techniques and other suitable formulations are disclosed in <i>Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, </i>20th Ed., Alfonso Gennaro, Ed., Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and <i>Science </i>(2000).</p><p id="p-0400" num="0393">Drug conjugtation involves coupling of a biological active cytotoxic (anticancer) payload or drug to an antibody that specifically targets a certain tumor marker (e.g. a protein that, ideally, is only to be found in or on tumor cells). Antibodies track these proteins down in the body and attach themselves to the surface of cancer cells. The biochemical reaction between the antibody and the target protein (antigen) triggers a signal in the tumor cell, which then absorbs or internalizes the antibody together with the cytotoxin. After the ADC is internalized, the cytotoxic drug is released and kills the cancer. Due to this targeting, ideally the drug has lower side effects and gives a wider therapeutic window than other chemotherapeutic agents.

In certain embodiments, the method for identifying a candidate agonist antibody that specifically binds to TREM2 and/or DAP12 comprises a. contacting an innate immune cell population expressing TREM2 and/or DAP12 on its surface with a candidate agonist antibody that specifically binds to the TREM2 and/or DAP12 for a period of time sufficient for the candidate agonist antibody to promote cell survival in the innate immune cell population; and b. comparing cell survival of the contacted innate immune cell population contacted cell with cell survival from a corresponding innate immune cell population not contacted with the candidate agonist antibody that specifically binds to the TREM2 and/or DAP12, wherein increased cell survival from the contacted innate immune cell population indicates that the candidate antibody is an agonist. Other aspects of the present disclosure provide an isolated antibody that specifically binds to TREM2 and/or DAP12 identified by any of the disclosed methods for identifying an antibody that specifically binds to TREM2 and/or DAP12.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Nucleic Acids, Vectors, and Host Cells</heading><p id="p-0408" num="0401">Anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies of the present disclosure may be produced using recombinant methods and compositions, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat.

In some embodiments, one or more vectors (e.g., expression vectors) containing such nucleic acids are provided. In some embodiments, a host cell containing such nucleic acid is also provided. In some embodiments, the host cell is an isolated host cell. As used herein, an &#x201c;isolated cell&#x201d; is a cell that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant cell with which it is ordinarily associated in the environment in which it was produced. In some embodiments, the isolated cell is free of association with all components associated with the production environment. The isolated cell is in a form other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated cells are distinguished from cells existing naturally in tissues, organs, or individuals.

In some embodiments, the method includes culturing a host cell of the present disclosure containing a nucleic acid encoding the anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody, under conditions suitable for expression of the antibody. In some embodiments, the antibody is subsequently recovered from the host cell (or host cell culture medium).</p><p id="p-0410" num="0403">For recombinant production of an anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure, a nucleic acid encoding the anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody is isolated and inserted into one or more vectors for further cloning and/or expression in a host cell. Such nucleic acid may be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody).</p><p id="p-0411" num="0404">Suitable vectors containing a nucleic acid sequence encoding any of the anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies of the present disclosure, or fragments thereof polypeptides (including antibodies) described herein include, without limitation, cloning vectors and expression vectors. Suitable cloning vectors can be constructed according to standard techniques, or may be selected from a large number of cloning vectors available in the art. While the cloning vector selected may vary according to the host cell intended to be used, useful cloning vectors generally have the ability to self-replicate, may possess a single target for a particular restriction endonuclease, and/or may carry genes for a marker that can be used in selecting clones containing the vector. Suitable examples include plasmids and bacterial viruses, e.g., pUC18, pUC19, Bluescript (e.g., pBS SK+) and its derivatives, mpl8, mpl9, pBR322, pMB9, ColE1, pCR1, RP4, phage DNAs, and shuttle vectors such as pSA3 and pAT28. These and many other cloning vectors are available from commercial vendors such as BioRad, Strategene, and Invitrogen.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0405">Expression vectors generally are replicable polynucleotide constructs that contain a nucleic acid of the present disclosure. The expression vector may replicable in the host cells either as episomes or as an integral part of the chromosomal DNA. Suitable expression vectors include but are not limited to plasmids, viral vectors, including adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, retroviruses, cosmids, and expression vector(s) disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 87/04462. Vector components may generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence; an origin of replication; one or more marker genes; suitable transcriptional controlling elements (such as promoters, enhancers and terminator). For expression (i.e., translation), one or more translational controlling elements are also usually required, such as ribosome binding sites, translation initiation sites, and stop codons.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0406">The vectors containing the nucleic acids of interest can be introduced into the host cell by any of a number of appropriate means, including electroporation, transfection employing calcium chloride, rubidium chloride, calcium phosphate, DEAE-dextran, or other substances; microprojectile bombardment; lipofection; and infection (e.g., where the vector is an infectious agent such as vaccinia virus). The choice of introducing vectors or polynucleotides will often depend on features of the host cell. In some embodiments, the vector contains a nucleic acid containing one or more amino acid sequences encoding an anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0407">Suitable host cells for cloning or expression of antibody-encoding vectors include prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. For example, anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibodies of the present disclosure may be produced in bacteria, in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,648,237, 5,789,199, and 5,840,523; and Charlton, <i>Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. </i>248 (B. K. C. Lo, ed., Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., 2003), pp. 245-254, describing expression of antibody fragments in <i>E. coli</i>.). After expression, the antibody may be isolated from the bacterial cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be further purified.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0408">In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microorganisms, such as filamentous fungi or yeast, are also suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody-encoding vectors, including fungi and yeast strains whose glycosylation pathways have been &#x201c;humanized,&#x201d; resulting in the production of an antibody with a partially or fully human glycosylation pattern (e.g., Gerngross, <i>Nat. Biotech. </i>22:1409-1414 (2004); and Li et al., <i>Nat. Biotech. </i>24:210-215 (2006)).</p><p id="p-0416" num="0409">Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibody can also be derived from multicellular organisms (invertebrates and vertebrates). Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains have been identified which may be used in conjunction with insect cells, particularly for transfection of <i>Spodoptera frugiperda </i>cells. Plant cell cultures can also be utilized as hosts (e.g., U.S. Pat.

Examples of such formulations include, without limitation, tablets, capsules, powders, granules, ointments, solutions, suppositories, injections, inhalants, gels, microspheres, and aerosols. Pharmaceutical compositions can include, depending on the formulation desired, pharmaceutically-acceptable, non-toxic carriers of diluents, which are vehicles commonly used to formulate pharmaceutical compositions for animal or human administration. The diluent is selected so as not to affect the biological activity of the combination. Examples of such diluents include, without limitation, distilled water, buffered water, physiological saline, PBS, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, and Hank's solution. A pharmaceutical composition or formulation of the present disclosure can further include other carriers, adjuvants, or non-toxic, nontherapeutic, nonimmunogenic stabilizers, excipients and the like. The compositions can also include additional substances to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, toxicity adjusting agents, wetting agents and detergents.</p><p id="p-0419" num="0412">A pharmaceutical composition of the present disclosure can also include any of a variety of stabilizing agents, such as an antioxidant for example. When the pharmaceutical composition includes a polypeptide, the polypeptide can be complexed with various well-known compounds that enhance the in vivo stability of the polypeptide, or otherwise enhance its pharmacological properties (e.g., increase the half-life of the polypeptide, reduce its toxicity, and enhance solubility or uptake). Examples of such modifications or complexing agents include, without limitation, sulfate, gluconate, citrate and phosphate. The polypeptides of a composition can also be complexed with molecules that enhance their in vivo attributes. Such molecules include, without limitation, carbohydrates, polyamines, amino acids, other peptides, ions (e.g., sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, manganese), and lipids.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0413">Further examples of formulations that are suitable for various types of administration can be found in <i>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences</i>, Mace Publishing Company, Philadelphia, Pa., 17th ed. (1985). For a brief review of methods for drug delivery, see, Langer, <i>Science </i>249:1527-1533 (1990).</p><p id="p-0421" num="0414">For oral administration, the active ingredient can be administered in solid dosage forms, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, or in liquid dosage forms, such as elixirs, syrups, and suspensions. The active component(s) can be encapsulated in gelatin capsules together with inactive ingredients and powdered carriers, such as glucose, lactose, sucrose, mannitol, starch, cellulose or cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, sodium saccharin, talcum, magnesium carbonate. Examples of additional inactive ingredients that may be added to provide desirable color, taste, stability, buffering capacity, dispersion or other known desirable features are red iron oxide, silica gel, sodium lauryl sulfate, titanium dioxide, and edible white ink. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric-coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain coloring and flavoring to increase patient acceptance.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0415">Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which can contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0416">The components used to formulate the pharmaceutical compositions are preferably of high purity and are substantially free of potentially harmful contaminants (e.g., at least National Food (NF) grade, generally at least analytical grade, and more typically at least pharmaceutical grade). Moreover, compositions intended for in vivo use are usually sterile. To the extent that a given compound must be synthesized prior to use, the resulting product is typically substantially free of any potentially toxic agents, particularly any endotoxins, which may be present during the synthesis or purification process. Compositions for parental administration are also sterile, substantially isotonic and made under GMP conditions.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0417">Formulations may be optimized for retention and stabilization in the brain or central nervous system. When the agent is administered into the cranial compartment, it is desirable for the agent to be retained in the compartment, and not to diffuse or otherwise cross the blood brain barrier. Stabilization techniques include cross-linking, multimerizing, or linking to groups such as polyethylene glycol, polyacrylamide, neutral protein carriers, etc. in order to achieve an increase in molecular weight.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0418">Other strategies for increasing retention include the entrapment of the antibody, such as an anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure, in a biodegradable or bioerodible implant. The rate of release of the therapeutically active agent is controlled by the rate of transport through the polymeric matrix, and the biodegradation of the implant. The transport of drug through the polymer barrier will also be affected by compound solubility, polymer hydrophilicity, extent of polymer cross-linking, expansion of the polymer upon water absorption so as to make the polymer barrier more permeable to the drug, geometry of the implant, and the like. The implants are of dimensions commensurate with the size and shape of the region selected as the site of implantation. Implants may be particles, sheets, patches, plaques, fibers, microcapsules and the like and may be of any size or shape compatible with the selected site of insertion.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0419">The implants may be monolithic, i.e. having the active agent homogenously distributed through the polymeric matrix, or encapsulated, where a reservoir of active agent is encapsulated by the polymeric matrix. The selection of the polymeric composition to be employed will vary with the site of administration, the desired period of treatment, patient tolerance, the nature of the disease to be treated and the like. Characteristics of the polymers will include biodegradability at the site of implantation, compatibility with the agent of interest, ease of encapsulation, a half-life in the physiological environment.</p><p id="p-0427" num="0420">Biodegradable polymeric compositions that may be employed include, without limitation, organic esters or ethers, which when degraded result in physiologically acceptable degradation products, including the monomers. Anhydrides, amides, orthoesters or the like, by themselves or in combination with other monomers, may find use. The polymers will be condensation polymers. The polymers may be cross-linked or non-cross-linked. Of particular interest are polymers of hydroxyaliphatic carboxylic acids, either homo- or copolymers, and polysaccharides. Included among the polyesters of interest are polymers of D-lactic acid, L-lactic acid, racemic lactic acid, glycolic acid, polycaprolactone, and combinations thereof. By employing the L-lactate or D-lactate, a slowly biodegrading polymer is achieved, while degradation is substantially enhanced with the racemate. Copolymers of glycolic and lactic acid are of particular interest, where the rate of biodegradation is controlled by the ratio of glycolic to lactic acid. The most rapidly degraded copolymer has roughly equal amounts of glycolic and lactic acid, where either homopolymer is more resistant to degradation. The ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid will also affect the brittleness of in the implant, where a more flexible implant is desirable for larger geometries. Among the polysaccharides of interest are calcium alginate, and functionalized celluloses, particularly carboxymethylcellulose esters characterized by being water insoluble, a molecular weight of about 5 kD to 500 kD, etc. Biodegradable hydrogels may also be employed in the implants of the subject invention. Hydrogels are typically a copolymer material, characterized by the ability to imbibe a liquid. Exemplary biodegradable hydrogels which may be employed are described in Heller in: Hydrogels in Medicine and Pharmacy, N. A. Peppes ed., Vol. III, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., 1987, pp 137-149.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0421">Pharmaceutical Dosages</p><p id="p-0429" num="0422">Pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure containing an anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody of the present disclosure may be administered to an individual in need of treatment with the anti-TREM2 and/or anti-DAP12 antibody, preferably a human, in accord with known methods, such as intravenous administration as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerobrospinal, intracranial, intraspinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral, topical, or inhalation routes.</p><p id="p-0430" num="0423">Dosages and desired drug concentration of pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure may vary depending on the particular use envisioned.

It is within the scope of the invention that different formulations will be effective for different treatments and different disorders, and that administration intended to treat a specific organ or tissue may necessitate delivery in a manner different from that to another organ or tissue. Moreover, dosages may be administered by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion.

The clinical features of FTD include memory deficits, behavioral abnormalities, personality changes, and language impairments (Cruts, M. &#x26; Van Broeckhoven, C., Trends Genet. 24:186-194 (2008); Neary, D., et al., Neurology 51:1546-1554 (1998); Ratnavalli, E., Brayne, C., Dawson, K. &#x26; Hodges, J.

FTD, like most neurodegenerative diseases, can be characterized by the pathological presence of specific protein aggregates in the diseased brain. Historically, the first descriptions of FTD recognized the presence of intraneuronal accumulations of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles or Pick bodies. A causal role for the microtubule associated protein Tau was supported by the identification of mutations in the gene encoding the Tau protein in several families (Hutton, M., et al., Nature 393:702-705 (1998). However, the majority of FTD brains show no accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau but do exhibit immunoreactivity to ubiquitin (Ub) and TAR DNA binding protein (TDP43) (Neumann, M., et al., Arch. Neurol. 64:1388-1394 (2007)).

NHD disease course is generally divided into four stages: latent, osseous, early neurologic, and late neurologic. After a normal development during childhood (latent stage), NHD starts manifesting during adolescence or young adulthood (typical age of onset 20-30 years) with pain in the hands, wrists, ankles, and feet. Patients then start suffering from recurrent bone fractures due to polycystic osseous and osteroporotic lesions in the limb bones (osseous stage). During the third or fourth decade of life (early neurologic stage), patients present with pronounced personality changes (e.g., euphoria, lack of concentration, loss of judgment, and social inhibitions) characteristic of a frontal lobe syndrome. Patients also typically suffer from progressive memory disturbances. Epileptic seizures are also frequently observed.

MS affects the ability of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to communicate with each other effectively. Nerve cells communicate by sending electrical signals called action potentials down long fibers called axons, which are contained within an insulating substance called myelin.

In particular, the presence of M2-macrophages in tumors is associated with poor prognosis. Therapies that reduce the number of these cells in the tumor, such as CSF1R blocking agents, are showing beneficial effects in preclinical models and early stage clinical studies. It has been shown that TREM2 synergizes with CSF1 to promote survival of macrophages in vitro, and that this effect is particularly prominent in M2-type macrophages, compared to other types of phagocytic cells. A seminal preclinical study has also shown synergies between drugs that target tumor-associated macrophages (e.g., CSF1/CSF1R blocking antibodies) and checkpoint blocking antibodies that target T cells, indicating that manipulating both cell types shows efficacy in tumor models where individual therapies are poorly effective (Zhu Y; Cancer Res. 2014 Sep. 15; 74(18):5057-69).

These homologues included the Natural Killer (NK) cell receptor NK-p44 (NCTR2), the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), CD300E, CD300A, CD300C, and TREML1/TLT1. The closest homologue was identified as NCTR2, having similarity with TREM2 within the IgV domain (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). A BLAST analysis also compared TREM proteins with other IgV family proteins (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0509" num="0641">TREM2 is also closely related to TREM1. An alignment of the amino acid sequences of TREM1 and TREM2 was generated by 2-way blast (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). This is limited to the IgV domain as well.</p><p id="p-0510" num="0642">Agonistic antibodies for TREM1, NK-p44, and other members of this family have been previously described. Antibodies that bind the extracellular domain of TREM2, particularly the IgV domain (amino acid residues 29-112 of SEQ ID NO: 1) are generated using mouse hybridoma technology, phage display technology, and yeast display technology. Antibodies are then screened for their ability to activate TREM2 signaling and functions in cells and in a whole animal in vivo as described in Examples 2-39 below.</p><p id="p-0511" num="0643">For example, agonist anti-TREM2 antibodies can be produced that target the IgV domain (amino acid residues 29-112). IgV domains bind to targets, and through multimerization of receptors, such as IgG itself or NKp44, lead to activation. Thus these domains are rational targets for agonistic antibodies. They are also highly divergent.</p><p id="p-0512" num="0644">Agonist anti-TREM2 antibodies can also be produced that target amino acid residues 99-115 of human TREM2. It is believed that amino acid residues 99-115 correspond to a peptide that block binding of TREM2 to its endogenous target, as the corresponding peptide in mouse TREM1 (amino acid residues 83-99) block binding of TREM1 to its endogenous target (Gibot et al., Infect. Immunity 2004). The mouse TREM1 peptide is called LP17 (LQVTDSGLYRCVIYHPP (SEQ ID NO: 414)). The equivalent region in human TREM2 is located within the CD3 domain and is located at amino acid residues 99-115 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (LQPHDAGLYQCQSLHG). Antibodies that block ligand binding could activate the receptors similar to the ligand itself.</p><p id="p-0513" num="0645">Another approach for predicting a relevant (e.g., agonistic) site within the human TREM2 protein is by targeting the sites where the mutations are found in Alzheimer's disease (e.g., R47H), Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL), or Nasu-Hakola disease. Also relevant is the site of the major mutations associated with human disease, which are generally found within the IgV domain.</p><p id="p-0514" num="0646">The crystal structures of the TREM2-related structures of TREM1 (Kelker, M S et al., J Mol Biol, 2004. 344(5): p. 1175-81; Kelker, M S et al., J Mol Biol, 2004. 342(4): p. 1237-48; and Radaev, S et al., Structure, 2003. 11(12): p. 1527-35), TLT1 (Gattis, J L et al., <i>J Biol Chem, </i>2006. 281(19): p. 13396-403), and NKp44 have been described, and thus structural regions/features are identified within the IgV domain that are particularly likely to play a central role in interacting with natural agonists. These studies support the belief that the complementary determining regions (CDR1, CDR2, CDR3) play a major role in ligand binding. TREM1 has been reported to be either monomeric (Gattis, J L et al., J Biol Chem, 2006. 281(19): p. 13396-403) or dimeric (Radaev, S et al., Structure, 2003. 11(12): p. 1527-35) in vitro under cell-free conditions, but its oligomeric state in vivo remains unclear, as well as that of TREM2.</p><p id="p-0515" num="0647">The amino acid sequence of human DAP12 is set forth below as SEQ ID NO: 2:</p><p id="p-0516" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00008" num="00008"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;10&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;20&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;30&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;40</entry></row><row><entry>MGGLEPCSRL&#x2003;LLLPLLLAVS&#x2003;GLRPVQAQAQ&#x2003;SDCSCSTVSP</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;50&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;60&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;70&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;80</entry></row><row><entry>GVLAGIVMGD&#x2003;LVLTVLIALA&#x2003;VYFLGRLVPR&#x2003;GRGAAEAATR</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;90&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;100&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;110</entry></row><row><entry>KQRITETESP&#x2003;YQELQGQRSD&#x2003;VYSDLNTQRP&#x2003;YYK</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0517" num="0648">DAP12 is a single-pass type I membrane protein.

Briefly, yeast cells (&#x2dc;10<sup>10 </sup>cells/library) were incubated with 3 ml of 200 nM biotinylated TREM2 antigen or 10 nM biotinylated TREM2-Fc fusion antigen for 15 min at room temperature in FACS wash buffer PBS with 0.1% BSA. Biotinylations were performed using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotinylation Kit (Thermo Scientific, Cat #21425). After washing once with 50 ml ice-cold wash buffer, the cell pellet was resuspended in 40 mL wash buffer, and 500 &#x3bc;l Streptavidin MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. Cat #130-048-101) were added to the yeast and incubated for 15 min at 4&#xb0; C. Next, the yeast were pelleted, resuspended in 5 mL wash buffer, and loaded onto a MACS LS column (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. Cat. #130-042-401). After the 5 mL was loaded, the column was washed 3 times with 3 ml FACS wash buffer. The column was then removed from the magnetic field, and the yeast were eluted with 5 mL of growth media and then grown overnight. The following three rounds of sorting were performed using flow cytometry. Approximately 1&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>yeast were pelleted, washed three times with wash buffer, and incubated with 200 nM, 100, or 10 biotinylated TREM2 for 10 min at room temperature respectively. Yeast were then washed twice and stained with goat anti-human F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>kappa-FITC diluted 1:100 (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, Ala., Cat#2062-02) and either streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 633 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y., Cat # S21375) diluted 1:500 or Extravidin-phycoerthyrin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Cat # E4011) diluted 1:50 secondary reagents for 15 min at 4&#xb0; C. After washing twice with ice-cold wash buffer, the cell pellets were resuspended in 0.4 mL wash buffer and transferred to strainer-capped sort tubes.

Briefly, ForteBio affinity measurements were performed by loading IgGs on-line onto AHQ sensors. Sensors were equilibrated off-line in assay buffer for 30 min and then monitored on-line for 60 seconds for baseline establishment. Sensors with loaded IgGs were exposed to 100 nM antigen for 5 minutes, then transferred to assay buffer for 5 min for off-rate measurement.

Antibodies (20 nM in PBS) were coated onto standard bind MSD-ECL plates overnight at 4&#xb0; C. or at room temperature for 30 min. Plates were then blocked for 30 min with shaking at 700 rpm, followed by three washes with wash buffer (PBSF+0.05% Tween 20). SET samples were applied and incubated on the plates for 150s with shaking at 700 rpm followed by one wash. Antigen captured on a plate was detected with 250 ng/mL sulfotag-labeled streptavidin in PBSF by incubation on the plate for 3 min. The plates were washed three times with wash buffer and then read on the MSD Sector Imager 2400 instrument using 1&#xd7; Read Buffer T with surfactant. The percent free antigen was plotted as a function of titrated antibody in Prism and fit to a quadratic equation to extract the K<sub>D</sub>.

Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0716" num="0834">Transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO)&#x2014;a model that closely resembles human stroke is used to induce cerebral infarction in mice. Monofilament (70SPRe, Doccol Corp, USA) is introduced into the internal carotid artery through an incision of the right common carotid artery.
