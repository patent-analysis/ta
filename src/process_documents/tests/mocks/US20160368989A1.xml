FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The instant disclosure relates to antibodies that specifically bind to human CTLA-4 and methods of using the same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">T-lymphocytes are central to the adaptive immune response to antigen. At least two signals are required for full activation of naive T-cells (Bretscher 1999, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96:185-90). A first, antigen-specific signal is provided by interaction of the T-cell receptor (TCR) with MHC/peptide complex on an antigen-presenting cell (APC). A second, co-stimulatory signal is provided by the interactions between receptors on the T-cell and their ligands on an antigen presenting cell (APC). Engagement of both TCR/MHC and co-stimulatory interactions leads to T-cell activation via a number of intracellular pathways, including calcium-calcineurin and RAS mitogen-activated protein kinase, and subsequent activation of transcription factors for a number of effector compounds, including cytokines such as IL-2. These events lead to T-cell proliferation, generation of a CD4<sup>+ </sup>helper T-cell (T<sup>H</sup>) pool, and expansion of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T-cells. Not only is co-stimulation critical for full T-cell activation, its absence during TCR/MHC engagement results in anergy and/or apoptosis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Multiple positive and negative co-stimulatory pathways are involved in T-cell regulation, however, the most critical are between CD28 on T-cells and B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) on APCs. CD28 promotes T-cell differentiation into TH1 phenotype cells and enhances antibody production by B cells and activation of T-cells. B7-1 and B7-2, expressed on APCs such as dendritic cells (DC) and B cells, have overlapping but distinct functions. B7-2 is constitutively expressed and is rapidly upregulated on APCs coincident with TCR/MHC engagement (signal 1). B7-1 expression is very low on the resting cell, but is typically induced after prolonged T-cell stimulation. These differences suggest that while B7-2 may be important in initialization of T-cell activation, B7-1 may play a greater role in perpetuating the immune response.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">After T-cell activation, a negative regulatory receptor Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is upregulated on T-cells (Alegre et al., 2001, Nat Rev Immunol 1:220-8). CTLA-4 is structurally homologous to CD28 but binds more tightly to both B7-1 and B7-2 ligands. CTLA-4 inhibits the immune response in several ways: it competes with CD28 for the B7 ligands and thus blocks co-stimulation; it negatively signals to inhibit T-cell activation; and it can capture CD80 and CD86 from opposing cells by trans-endocytosis, resulting in impaired costimulation via CD28 (Krummel and Allison, 1995, J Exp Med 182:459-465; Walunas et al., 1994, Immunity 1:405-413; Qureshi et al., 2011, Science 332:600-603).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Given the critical role of the B7 co-stimulatory pathway in promoting and maintaining an immune response, therapeutic agents designed to antagonize this pathway are promising for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and disorders.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">3.

In certain embodiments, antibodies described herein are IgG antibodies, or a class (e.g., human IgG<sub>1 </sub>or IgG<sub>4</sub>) or subclass thereof. In a specific embodiment, the antibody is a humanized monoclonal antibody. In another specific embodiment, the antibody is a human monoclonal antibody. In certain embodiments, an antibody described herein is an IgG<sub>1 </sub>or IgG<sub>2 </sub>antibody.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;VH region&#x201d; and &#x201c;VL region&#x201d; refer to single antibody heavy and light chain variable regions, respectively, comprising FR (Framework Regions) 1, 2, 3 and 4 and CDR (Complementarity Determining Regions) 1, 2 and 3 (see Kabat et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest.

These particular regions have been described by Kabat et al., J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6609-6616 (1977) and Kabat et al., Sequences of protein of immunological interest. (1991), and by Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987) and by MacCallum et al., J. Mol. Biol. 262:732-745 (1996) where the definitions include overlapping or subsets of amino acid residues when compared against each other. The amino acid residues which encompass the CDRs as defined by each of the above cited references are set forth for comparison. Preferably, the term &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; is a CDR as defined by Kabat, based on sequence comparisons. CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 denote the heavy chain CDRs, and CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3 denote the light chain CDRs.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0093">As used herein, the term &#x201c;EU numbering system&#x201d; refers to the EU numbering convention for the constant regions of an antibody, as described in Edelman, G.

The term &#x201c;framework region&#x201d; or &#x201c;FR region&#x201d; as used herein, includes the amino acid residues that are part of the variable region, but are not part of the CDRs (e.g., using the Kabat definition of CDRs).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0095">As used herein, the term &#x201c;afucosylation&#x201d; or &#x201c;afucosylated&#x201d; in the context of an Fc refers to a substantial lack of a fucose covalently attached, directly or indirectly, to residue 297 of the human IgG1 Fc region, numbered according to the EU index (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)), or the corresponding residue in non-IgG1 or non-human IgG1 immunoglobulins. Thus, in a composition comprising a plurality of afucosylated antibodies, at least 70% of the antibodies will not be fucosylated, directly or indirectly (e.g., via intervening sugars) at residue 297 of the Fc region of the antibodies, and in some embodiments at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% will not be fucosylated, directly or indirectly, at residue 297 of the Fc region.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0096">As used herein, the term &#x201c;specifically binds to&#x201d; refers to the ability of an antibody to bind to an antigen with an dissociation constant (Kd) of at least about 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M, 1&#xd7;10 M, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M, 1&#xd7;10 M, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;11 </sup>M, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>M, or less, and/or bind to an antigen with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for a nonspecific antigen.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0097">As used herein, an &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; is a term in the art and refers to a localized region of an antigen to which an antibody can specifically bind. An epitope can be, for example, contiguous amino acids of a polypeptide (linear or contiguous epitope) or an epitope can, for example, come together from two or more non-contiguous regions of a polypeptide or polypeptides (conformational, non-linear, discontinuous, or non-contiguous epitope). In certain embodiments, the epitope to which an antibody binds can be determined by, e.g., NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction crystallography studies, ELISA assays, hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (e.g., liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry), array-based oligo-peptide scanning assays, and/or mutagenesis mapping (e.g., site-directed mutagenesis mapping). For X-ray crystallography, crystallization may be accomplished using any of the known methods in the art (e.g., Gieg&#xe9; R et al., (1994) Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 50(Pt 4): 339-350; McPherson A (1990) Eur J Biochem 189: 1-23; Chayen N E (1997) Structure 5: 1269-1274; McPherson A (1976) J Biol Chem 251: 6300-6303). Antibody:antigen crystals may be studied using well known X-ray diffraction techniques and may be refined using computer software such as X-PLOR (Yale University, 1992, distributed by Molecular Simulations, Inc.; see e.g. Meth Enzymol (1985) volumes 114 &#x26; 115, eds Wyckoff H W et al.; U.S. 2004/0014194), and BUSTER (Bricogne G (1993) Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 49(Pt 1): 37-60; Bricogne G (1997) Meth Enzymol 276A: 361-423, ed Carter C W; Roversi P et al., (2000) Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 56(Pt 10): 1316-1323). Mutagenesis mapping studies may be accomplished using any method known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Champe M et al., (1995) J Biol Chem 270: 1388-1394 and Cunningham B C &#x26; Wells J A (1989) Science 244: 1081-1085 for a description of mutagenesis techniques, including alanine scanning mutagenesis techniques. In a specific embodiment, the epitope of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof is determined using alanine scanning mutagenesis studies.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0098">As used herein, the term &#x201c;treat,&#x201d; &#x201c;treating,&#x201d; and &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; refer to therapeutic or preventative measures described herein. The methods of &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; employ administration of an antibody to a subject having a disease or disorder, or predisposed to having such a disease or disorder, in order to prevent, cure, delay, reduce the severity of, or ameliorate one or more symptoms of the disease or disorder or recurring disease or disorder, or in order to prolong the survival of a subject beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0099">As used herein, the term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; in the context of the administration of a therapy to a subject refers to the amount of a therapy that achieves a desired prophylactic or therapeutic effect.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100">As used herein, the term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; includes any human or non-human animal.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0101">Hydrogen-deuterium exchange is evaluated using an assay comprising the following steps: (a) taking a solution of CTLA-4 alone or CTLA-4 in combination with an antibody in aqueous buffer and diluting this solution into an approximately 90% volume/volume excess of deuterium oxide labeling buffer for, e.g., 0, 60, 300, 1800, and 7200 seconds; (b) quenching the exchange of hydrogen with deuterium by lowering the pH; (c) subjecting the samples to protease digestion and mass spectrometric analysis; and (d) calculating deuterium incorporation in CTLA-4 proteolytic peptides and comparing deuterium incorporation in the presence or absence of the antibody. The exchange of hydrogen with deuterium in a CTLA-4 proteolytic peptide is &#x201c;reduced&#x201d; if the hydrogen/deuterium exchange in the presence of an anti-CTLA-4 antibody is reduced by at least 10% relative to the hydrogen/deuterium exchange in the absence of the antibody, as assessed by the foregoing assay.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">5.2 Anti-CTLA-4 Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0105" num="0102">In one aspect the instant disclosure provides antibodies that specifically bind to human CTLA-4 and antagonize CTLA-4 function.

In certain embodiments, the vaccine is a heat shock protein based tumor vaccine or a heat shock protein based pathogen vaccine. In a specific embodiment, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody disclosed herein is administered to a subject in combination with a heat shock protein based tumor-vaccine. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of highly conserved proteins found ubiquitously across all species. Their expression can be powerfully induced to much higher levels as a result of heat shock or other forms of stress, including exposure to toxins, oxidative stress or glucose deprivation. Five families have been classified according to molecular weight: HSP-110, -90, -70, -60 and -28. HSPs deliver immunogenic peptides through the cross-presentation pathway in antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), leading to T cell activation. HSPs function as chaperone carriers of tumor-associated antigenic peptides forming complexes able to induce tumor-specific immunity. Upon release from dying tumor cells, the HSP-antigen complexes are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) wherein the antigens are processed into peptides that bind MHC class I and class II molecules leading to the activation of anti-tumor CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The immunity elicited by HSP complexes derived from tumor preparations is specifically directed against the unique antigenic peptide repertoire expressed by the cancer of each subject.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0173">A heat shock protein peptide complex (HSPPC) is a protein peptide complex consisting of a heat shock protein non-covalently complexed with antigenic peptides. HSPPCs elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses. In a specific embodiment, the antigenic peptide(s) displays antigenicity for the cancer being treated. HSPPCs are efficiently seized by APCs via membrane receptors (mainly CD91) or by binding to Toll-like receptors. HSPPC internalization results in functional maturation of the APCs with chemokine and cytokine production leading to activation of natural killer cells (NK), monocytes and Th1 and Th-2-mediated immune responses. In certain embodiments, HSPPCs used in methods disclosed herein comprise one or more heat shock proteins from the hsp60, hsp70, or hsp90 family of stress proteins complexed with antigenic peptides. In certain embodiments, HSPPCs comprise hsc70, hsp70, hsp90, hsp110, grp170, gp96, calreticulin, or combinations of two or more thereof.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0174">In a specific embodiment, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody disclosed herein is administered to a subject in combination with a heat shock protein peptide complex (HSPPC), e.g., heat shock protein peptide complex-96 (HSPPC-96), to treat cancer. HSPPC-96 comprises a 96 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp), gp96, complexed to antigenic peptides. HSPPC-96 is a cancer immunotherapy manufactured from a subject's tumor and contains the cancer's antigenic &#x201c;fingerprint.&#x201d; In certain embodiments, this fingerprint contains unique antigens that are present only in that particular subject's specific cancer cells and injection of the vaccine is intended to stimulate the subject's immune system to recognize and attack any cells with the specific cancer fingerprint.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0175">In certain embodiments, the HSPPC, e.g., HSPPC-96, is produced from the tumor tissue of a subject. In a specific embodiment, the HSPPC (e.g., HSPPC-96) is produced from a tumor of the type of cancer or metastasis thereof being treated. In another specific embodiment, the HSPPC (e.g., HSPPC-96) is autologous to the subject being treated. In certain embodiments, the tumor tissue is non-necrotic tumor tissue. In certain embodiments, at least 1 gram (e.g., at least 1, at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, or at least 10 grams) of non-necrotic tumor tissue is used to produce a vaccine regimen. In certain embodiments, after surgical resection, non-necrotic tumor tissue is frozen prior to use in vaccine preparation. In some embodiments, the HSPPC, e.g., HSPPC-96, is isolated from the tumor tissue by purification techniques, filtered and prepared for an injectable vaccine. In certain embodiments, a subject is administered 6-12 doses of the HSPPC, e.g., HSPCC-96. In such embodiments, the HSPPC, e.g., HSPPC-96, doses may be administered weekly for the first 4 doses and then biweekly for the 2-8 additional doses.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0176">Further examples of HSPPCs that may be used in accordance with the methods described herein are disclosed in the following patents and patent applications, which are incorporated herein by reference herein in their entireties, U.S. Pat.

For example, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies (Foecking M K &#x26; Hofstetter H (1986) Gene 45: 101-5; and Cockett M I et al., (1990) Biotechnology 8(7): 662-7). In certain embodiments, antibodies described herein are produced by CHO cells or NSO cells. In a specific embodiment, the expression of nucleotide sequences encoding antibodies described herein which specifically bind CTLA-4 (e.g., human CTLA-4) is regulated by a constitutive promoter, inducible promoter or tissue specific promoter.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0227">In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors can be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such an antibody is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified can be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited to, the <i>E. coli </i>expression vector pUR278 (Ruether U &#x26; Mueller-Hill B (1983) EMBO J 2: 1791-1794), in which the antibody coding sequence can be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye S &#x26; Inouye M (1985) Nuc Acids Res 13: 3101-3109; Van Heeke G &#x26; Schuster S M (1989) J Biol Chem 24: 5503-5509); and the like. For example, pGEX vectors can also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione 5-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0228">In an insect system, <i>Autographa californica </i>nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV), for example, can be used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in <i>Spodoptera frugiperda </i>cells. The antibody coding sequence can be cloned individually into non-essential regions (for example the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example the polyhedrin promoter).</p><p id="p-0241" num="0229">In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems can be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest can be ligated to an adenovirus transcription/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene can then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts (e.g., see Logan J &#x26; Shenk T (1984) <i>PNAS </i>81(12): 3655-9). Specific initiation signals can also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression can be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see, e.g., Bitter G et al., (1987) Methods Enzymol. 153: 516-544).</p><p id="p-0242" num="0230">In addition, a host cell strain can be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products can be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product can be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERO, BHK, Hela, MDCK, HEK 293, NIH 3T3, W138, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT2O and T47D, NS0 (a murine myeloma cell line that does not endogenously produce any immunoglobulin chains), CRL7O3O, COS (e.g., COS1 or COS), PER.C6, VERO, HsS78Bst, HEK-293T, HepG2, SP210, R1.1, B-W, L-M, BSC1, BSC40, YB/20, BMT10 and HsS78Bst cells. In certain embodiments, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies described herein are produced in mammalian cells, such as CHO cells.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0231">In a specific embodiment, the antibodies described herein or antigen-binding fragments thereof have reduced fucose content or no fucose content. Such antibodies can be produced using techniques known one skilled in the art. For example, the antibodies can be expressed in cells deficient or lacking the ability of to fucosylate. In a specific example, cell lines with a knockout of both alleles of a1,6-fucosyltransferase can be used to produce antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof with reduced fucose content. The Potelligent&#xae; system (Lonza) is an example of such a system that can be used to produce antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof with reduced fucose content.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0232">For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression cells can be generated. For example, cell lines which stably express an anti-CTLA-4 antibody described herein or an antigen-binding fragment thereof can be engineered. In specific embodiments, a cell provided herein stably expresses a light chain/light chain variable region and a heavy chain/heavy chain variable region which associate to form an antibody described herein or an antigen-binding fragment thereof.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0233">In certain aspects, rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA/polynucleotide, engineered cells can be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method can advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express an anti-CTLA-4 antibody described herein or a fragment thereof. Such engineered cell lines can be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compositions that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0234">A number of selection systems can be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler M et al., (1977) Cell 11(1): 223-32), hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska E H &#x26; Szybalski W (1962) PNAS 48(12): 2026-2034) and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy I et al., (1980) Cell 22(3): 817-23) genes in tk-, hgprt- or aprt-cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler M et al., (1980) PNAS 77(6): 3567-70; O'Hare K et al., (1981) PNAS 78: 1527-31); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan R C &#x26; Berg P (1981) PNAS 78(4): 2072-6); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (Wu G Y &#x26; Wu C H (1991) Biotherapy 3: 87-95; Tolstoshev P (1993) Ann Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 32: 573-596; Mulligan R C (1993) Science 260: 926-932; and Morgan R A &#x26; Anderson W F (1993) Ann Rev Biochem 62: 191-217; Nabel G J &#x26; Felgner P L (1993) Trends Biotechnol 11(5): 211-5); and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre R F et al., (1984) Gene 30(1-3): 147-56). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology can be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone and such methods are described, for example, in Ausubel F M et al., (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, N Y (1993); Kriegler M, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, N Y (1990); and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli N C et al., (eds.), Current Protocols in Human Genetics, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, N Y (1994); Colb&#xe8;re-Garapin F et al., (1981) J Mol Biol 150: 1-14, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0235">The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington C R &#x26; Hentschel C C G, The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA cloning, Vol. 3 (Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse G F et al., (1983) Mol Cell Biol 3: 257-66).</p><p id="p-0248" num="0236">The host cell can be co-transfected with two or more expression vectors described herein, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors can contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. The host cells can be co-transfected with different amounts of the two or more expression vectors. For example, host cells can be transfected with any one of the following ratios of a first expression vector and a second expression vector: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9, 1:10, 1:12, 1:15, 1:20, 1:25, 1:30, 1:35, 1:40, 1:45, or 1:50.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0237">Alternatively, a single vector can be used which encodes, and is capable of expressing, both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot N J (1986) Nature 322: 562-565; and K&#xf6;hler G (1980) PNAS 77: 2197-2199). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains can comprise cDNA or genomic DNA. The expression vector can be monocistronic or multicistronic. A multicistronic nucleic acid construct can encode 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more, or in the range of 2-5, 5-10 or 10-20 genes/nucleotide sequences. For example, a bicistronic nucleic acid construct can comprise in the following order a promoter, a first gene (e.g., heavy chain of an antibody described herein), and a second gene and (e.g., light chain of an antibody described herein). In such an expression vector, the transcription of both genes can be driven by the promoter, whereas the translation of the mRNA from the first gene can be by a cap-dependent scanning mechanism and the translation of the mRNA from the second gene can be by a cap-independent mechanism, e.g., by an IRES.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0238">Once an antibody molecule described herein has been produced by recombinant expression, it can be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Further, the antibodies described herein can be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art to facilitate purification.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0239">In specific embodiments, an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof described herein is isolated or purified. Generally, an isolated antibody is one that is substantially free of other antibodies with different antigenic specificities than the isolated antibody. For example, in a particular embodiment, a preparation of an antibody described herein is substantially free of cellular material and/or chemical precursors. The language &#x201c;substantially free of cellular material&#x201d; includes preparations of an antibody in which the antibody is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. Thus, an antibody that is substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of antibody having less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1% (by dry weight) of heterologous protein (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;contaminating protein&#x201d;) and/or variants of an antibody, for example, different post-translational modified forms of an antibody or other different versions of an antibody (e.g., antibody fragments). When the antibody is recombinantly produced, it is also generally substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, 10%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1% of the volume of the protein preparation. When the antibody is produced by chemical synthesis, it is generally substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals, i.e., it is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals which are involved in the synthesis of the protein. Accordingly, such preparations of the antibody have less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, or 5% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or compounds other than the antibody of interest. In a specific embodiment, antibodies described herein are isolated or purified.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0240">Antibodies or fragments thereof that specifically bind to CTLA-4 (e.g., human CTLA-4) can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies, for example, by chemical synthesis or by recombinant expression techniques.

For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught, for example, in Harlow E &#x26; Lane D, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling G J et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563 681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981). The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced recombinantly from host cells exogenously expressing an antibody described herein or a fragment thereof, for example, light chain and/or heavy chain of such antibody.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0245">In specific embodiments, a &#x201c;monoclonal antibody,&#x201d; as used herein, is an antibody produced by a single cell (e.g., hybridoma or host cell producing a recombinant antibody), wherein the antibody specifically binds to CTLA-4 (e.g., human CTLA-4) as determined, e.g., by ELISA or other antigen-binding or competitive binding assay known in the art or in the examples provided herein. In particular embodiments, a monoclonal antibody can be a chimeric antibody or a humanized antibody. In certain embodiments, a monoclonal antibody is a monovalent antibody or multivalent (e.g., bivalent) antibody. In particular embodiments, a monoclonal antibody is a monospecific or multispecific antibody (e.g., bispecific antibody). Monoclonal antibodies described herein can, for example, be made by the hybridoma method as described in Kohler G &#x26; Milstein C (1975) Nature 256: 495 or can, e.g., be isolated from phage libraries using the techniques as described herein, for example. Other methods for the preparation of clonal cell lines and of monoclonal antibodies expressed thereby are well known in the art (see, for example, Chapter 11 in: Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, (2002) 5th Ed., Ausubel F M et al., supra).</p><p id="p-0258" num="0246">Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. For example, in the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a sheep, goat, rabbit, rat, hamster or macaque monkey, is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein (e.g., CTLA-4 (e.g., human CTLA-4)) used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding J W (Ed), Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Additionally, a RIMMS (repetitive immunization multiple sites) technique can be used to immunize an animal (Kilpatrick K E et al., (1997) Hybridoma 16:381-9, incorporated by reference in its entirety).</p><p id="p-0259" num="0247">In some embodiments, mice (or other animals, such as rats, monkeys, donkeys, pigs, sheep, hamster, or dogs) can be immunized with an antigen (e.g., CTLA-4 (e.g., human CTLA-4)) and once an immune response is detected, e.g., antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well-known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells, for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC&#xae;) (Manassas, Va.), to form hybridomas. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. In certain embodiments, lymph nodes of the immunized mice are harvested and fused with NSO myeloma cells.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0248">The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0249">Specific embodiments employ myeloma cells that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as NS0 cell line or those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif., USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8.653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md., USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor D (1984) J Immunol 133: 3001-5; Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).</p><p id="p-0262" num="0250">Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against CTLA-4 (e.g., human CTLA-4).

In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In particular, DNA sequences encoding VH and VL domains are amplified from animal cDNA libraries (e.g., human or murine cDNA libraries of affected tissues). The DNA encoding the VH and VL domains are recombined together with a scFv linker by PCR and cloned into a phagemid vector. The vector is electroporated in <i>E. coli </i>and the <i>E. coli </i>is infected with helper phage. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13, and the VH and VL domains are usually recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII.

In particular embodiments, an antibody described herein, which competitively blocks (e.g., in a dose-dependent manner) any one of the antibodies described herein, from binding to CTLA-4 (e.g., human CTLA-4), is a human antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof. Human antibodies can be produced using any method known in the art. For example, transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes, can be used. In particular, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes can be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region can be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes can be rendered non-functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the J<sub>H </sub>region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of an antigen (e.g., CTLA-4). Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg N &#x26; Huszar D (1995) Int Rev Immunol 13:65-93.

The anti-CTLA-4 antibody AGEN1884 comprises a heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 93 and a light chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 15. The antibody AGEN1884 is a human IgG<sub>1 </sub>antibody containing a T109S substitution (i.e., substitution of threonine with serine at position 109 relative to the wild type Fc sequence), numbered according to Kabat, in the light chain constant domain, which facilitates the cloning of the variable region in frame to the constant region. This mutation is a conservative modification that does not affect antibody binding or function. The wild type counterpart, named AGEN1884w, which contains a threonine at position 109, numbered according to Kabat, was also generated.

All interactions were analyzed at 25&#xb0; C. using 1&#xd7;DPBS (PAA, H15-002) plus P20 (0.05%, Pierce, 28320) as running buffer. The anti-CTLA-4 antibodies (8 &#x3bc;g/ml in running buffer) were captured to the chip surface of a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare, Series S CM5, BR-1005-30) via an immobilized anti-human Fab antibody (GE Healthcare, Fab Capture Kit, 28958325). To detect nonspecific interactions of the CTLA-4 antigen, antibody capture was only performed in flow cell 2, whereas in flow cell 1 only the capturing antibody was immobilized. After capture of the anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, the CTLA-4 antigens were run through both flow cells in different amounts. Specifically, recombinant human CTLA-4-Fc (R&#x26;D Systems, #7268-CT), recombinant human CTLA-4 (Sino Biological, #11159-H08H), recombinant cynomolgus CTLA-4-Fc (Sino Biological, #90213-C02H), and recombinant cynomolgus CTLA-4 (Sino Biological, #90213-C08H) were run at 100 nM, 25 nM, and 6.25 nM; and recombinant mouse CTLA-4-Fc (R&#x26;D, #434-CT), recombinant rat CTLA-4-Fc (Sino Biological, #81069-R02H), and recombinant rat CTLA-4 (Sino Biological, #81069-R08H) were run at 400 nM, 100 nM, and 25 nM. A blank curve (running buffer only) was also included in each run. Association was run for 90 seconds and dissociation for 600 seconds with a flow rate of 10 &#x3bc;l/min. After each run a regeneration step was performed with 10 mM Glycine pH 2.0 (GE Healthcare, BR-1003-55) for 60 seconds with 30 &#x3bc;l/min.

The engineered Jurkat cell line was co-cultured with an antigen presenting cell line (Raji) that expressed CD80 and CD86. T cell receptor (TCR) triggering (Signal 1) was achieved with a mouse anti-human CD3 antibody and a goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody; and costimulatory signaling (Signal 2) was provided in trans by CD80 and CD86 expressed on Raji cells. The expression of CD80 and CD86 on Raji cells was confirmed by flow cytometry (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Cross-linking of the TCR on the Jurkat T cell line triggered IL-2 expression leading to luciferase production, a surrogate marker for T cell activation. Co-culture of these two cell lines resulted in engagement of the inhibitory co-receptor CTLA-4 (expressed on Jurkat cells) with its natural ligands CD80 and CD86 (expressed on Raji cells) inhibiting T cell activation, demonstrated by a lack of luciferase expression. This inhibition was relieved upon addition of increasing concentrations of AGEN1884w (0 to 300 &#x3bc;g/ml) due to AGEN1884w blocking the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands CD80 and CD86 and shifting the interaction of these ligands with the costimulatory T cell co-receptor CD28.

Exchange of deuterium for hydrogen was quenched by adding one volume of 4 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.85 M TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) buffer and final pH was 2.5. Samples were then subjected to on-column pepsin/protease type XIII digestion and LC-MS analysis. Mass spectra were recorded in MS only mode.
