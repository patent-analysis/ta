id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present disclosure provides antibodies that specifically bind to human OX40 receptor (OX40) and compositions comprising such antibodies. In a specific aspect, the antibodies specifically bind to human OX40 and modulate OX40 activity, e.g., enhance, activate, or induce OX40 activity, or reduce, deactivate, or inhibit OX40 activity. The present disclosure also provides methods for treating disorders, such as cancer, by administering an antibody that specifically binds to human OX40 and modulates OX40 activity, e.g., enhances, activates, or induces OX40 activity. Also provided are methods for treating autoimmune or inflammatory diseases or disorders, by administering an antibody that specifically binds to human OX40 and modulates OX40 activity, e.g., reduces, deactivates, or inhibits OX40 activity.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="262.38mm" wi="187.11mm" orientation="landscape"

FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to antibodies that specifically bind to human OX40 receptor (&#x201c;OX40&#x201d;), compositions comprising such antibodies, and methods of producing and using antibodies that specifically bind to OX40.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The contributions of the innate and adaptive immune response in the control of human tumor growth are well-characterized (Vesely M D et al., (2011) Annu Rev Immunol 29: 235-271). As a result, antibody-based strategies have emerged that aim to enhance T cell responses for the purpose of cancer therapy, such as targeting T cell expressed stimulatory receptors with agonist antibodies, or inhibitory receptors with functional antagonists (Mellman I et al., (2011) Nature 480: 480-489). Antibody-mediated agonist and antagonist approaches have shown preclinical, and more recently clinical, activity. An important stimulatory receptor that modulates T cell, Natural Killer T (NKT) cell, and NK cell function is the OX40 receptor (also known as OX40, CD134, TNFRSF4, TXGP1L, ACT35, and ACT-4) (Sugamura K et al., (2004) Nat Rev Immunol 4: 420-431). OX40 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) and signaling via OX40 can modulate important immune functions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">OX40 can be upregulated by antigen-specific T cells following T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) displaying MEW class I or II molecules loaded with a cognate peptide (Sugamura K et al., (2004) Nat Rev Immunol 4: 420-431). Upon maturation APCs such as dendritic cells (DCs) upregulate stimulatory B7 family members (e.g., CD80 and CD86), as well as accessory co-stimulatory molecules including OX40 ligand (OX40L), which help to sculpt the kinetics and magnitude of the T cell immune response, as well as effective memory cell differentiation. Notably, other cell types can also express constitutive and/or inducible levels of OX40L such as B cells, vascular endothelial cells, mast cells, and in some instances activated T cells (Soroosh P et al., (2006) J Immunol 176: 5975-5987). OX40:OX40L co-engagement is believed to drive the higher order clustering of receptor trimers and subsequent signal transduction (Compaan D M et al., (2006) Structure 14: 1321-1330).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">OX40 expression by T cells within the tumor microenvironment has been observed in murine and human tumor tissues (Bulliard Y et al., (2014) Immunol Cell Biol 92: 475-480 and Piconese S et al., (2014) Hepatology 60: 1494-1507). OX40 is highly expressed by intratumoral populations of regulatory T cells (Tregs) relative to conventional T cell populations, a feature attributed to their proliferative status (Waight J D et al., (2015) J Immunol 194: 878-882 and Bulliard Y et al., (2014) Immunol Cell Biol 92: 475-480). Early studies demonstrated that OX40 agonist antibodies were able to elicit tumor rejection in mouse models (Weinberg A D et al., (2000) J Immunol 164: 2160-2169 and Piconese S et al., (2008) J Exp Med 205: 825-839). A mouse antibody that agonizes human OX40 signaling has also been shown to enhance immune functions in cancer patients (Curti B D et al., (2013) Cancer Res 73: 7189-7198).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">OX40 and OX40L interactions also have been associated with immune responses in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and disorders, including mouse models of asthma/atopy, encephalomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, colitis/inflammatory bowel disease, graft-versus-host disease (e.g., transplant rejection), diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice, and atherosclerosis (Croft M et al., (2009) Immunol Rev 229(1): 173-191, and references cited therein). Reduced symptomatology associated with the diseases and disorders has been reported in OX40- and OX40L-deficient mice, in mice receiving anti-OX40 liposomes loaded with a cytostatic drug, and in mice in which OX40 and OX40L interactions were blocked with an anti-OX40L blocking antibody or a recombinant OX40 fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin (Croft M et al.; Boot E P J et al., (2005) Arthritis Res Ther 7: R604-615; Weinberg A D et al., (1999) J Immunol 162: 1818-1826). Treatment with a blocking anti-OX40L antibody was also shown to inhibit Th2 inflammation in a rhesus monkey model of asthma (Croft M et al.; Seshasayee D et al., (2007) J Clin Invest 117: 3868-3878). Additionally, polymorphisms in OX40L have been associated with lupus (Croft M et al.).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Given the role of human OX40 in modulating immune responses, provided herein are antibodies that specifically bind to OX40 and the use of these antibodies to modulate OX40 activity.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">3.

This definition allows for a value of B corresponding to a specified value of A to be up to 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% lower relative to a value of B corresponding to any lower value of A.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; and &#x201c;antibodies&#x201d; are terms of art and can be used interchangeably herein and refer to a molecule with an antigen-binding site that specifically binds an antigen.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">Antibodies can include, for example, monoclonal antibodies, recombinantly produced antibodies, human antibodies, humanized antibodies, resurfaced antibodies, chimeric antibodies, immunoglobulins, synthetic antibodies, tetrameric antibodies comprising two heavy chain and two light chain molecules, an antibody light chain monomer, an antibody heavy chain monomer, an antibody light chain dimer, an antibody heavy chain dimer, an antibody light chain-antibody heavy chain pair, intrabodies, heteroconjugate antibodies, single domain antibodies, monovalent antibodies, single chain antibodies or single-chain Fvs (scFv), camelized antibodies, affybodies, Fab fragments, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments, disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv), anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-anti-Id antibodies), bispecific antibodies, and multi-specific antibodies. In certain embodiments, antibodies described herein refer to polyclonal antibody populations. Antibodies can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA, or IgY), any class (e.g., IgG<sub>1</sub>, IgG<sub>2</sub>, IgG<sub>3</sub>, IgG<sub>4</sub>, IgA<sub>1</sub>, or IgA<sub>2</sub>), or any subclass (e.g., IgG<sub>2a </sub>or IgG<sub>2b</sub>) of immunoglobulin molecule. In certain embodiments, antibodies described herein are IgG antibodies, or a class (e.g., human IgG<sub>1</sub>, IgG<sub>2</sub>, or IgG<sub>4</sub>) or subclass thereof. In a specific embodiment, the antibody is a humanized monoclonal antibody. In another specific embodiment, the antibody is a human monoclonal antibody, e.g., that is an immunoglobulin. In certain embodiments, an antibody described herein is an IgG<sub>1</sub>, IgG<sub>2</sub>, or IgG<sub>4 </sub>antibody.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;antigen-binding domain,&#x201d; &#x201c;antigen-binding region,&#x201d; &#x201c;antigen-binding site,&#x201d; and similar terms refer to the portion of antibody molecules which comprises the amino acid residues that confer on the antibody molecule its specificity for the antigen (e.g., the complementarity determining regions (CDR)). The antigen-binding region can be derived from any animal species, such as rodents (e.g., mouse, rat, or hamster) and humans.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;variable region&#x201d; or &#x201c;variable domain&#x201d; are used interchangeably and are common in the art. The variable region typically refers to a portion of an antibody, generally, a portion of a light or heavy chain, typically about the amino-terminal 110 to 120 amino acids or 110 to 125 amino acids in the mature heavy chain and about 90 to 115 amino acids in the mature light chain, which differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. The variability in sequence is concentrated in those regions called complementarity determining regions (CDRs) while the more highly conserved regions in the variable domain are called framework regions (FR). Without wishing to be bound by any particular mechanism or theory, it is believed that the CDRs of the light and heavy chains are primarily responsible for the interaction and specificity of the antibody with antigen. In certain embodiments, the variable region is a human variable region. In certain embodiments, the variable region comprises rodent or murine CDRs and human framework regions (FRs). In particular embodiments, the variable region is a primate (e.g., non-human primate) variable region. In certain embodiments, the variable region comprises rodent or murine CDRs and primate (e.g., non-human primate) framework regions (FRs).</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">The terms &#x201c;VL&#x201d; and &#x201c;VL domain&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to the light chain variable region of an antibody.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">The terms &#x201c;VH&#x201d; and &#x201c;VH domain&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to the heavy chain variable region of an antibody.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">The term &#x201c;Kabat numbering&#x201d; and like terms are recognized in the art and refer to a system of numbering amino acid residues in the heavy and light chain variable regions of an antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof. In certain aspects, the CDRs of an antibody can be determined according to the Kabat numbering system (see, e.g., Kabat E A &#x26; Wu T T (1971) Ann NY Acad Sci 190: 382-391 and Kabat E A et al., (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242). Using the Kabat numbering system, CDRs within an antibody heavy chain molecule are typically present at amino acid positions 31 to 35, which optionally can include one or two additional amino acids, following 35 (referred to in the Kabat numbering scheme as 35A and 35B) (CDR1), amino acid positions 50 to 65 (CDR2), and amino acid positions 95 to 102 (CDR3). Using the Kabat numbering system, CDRs within an antibody light chain molecule are typically present at amino acid positions 24 to 34 (CDR1), amino acid positions 50 to 56 (CDR2), and amino acid positions 89 to 97 (CDR3). In a specific embodiment, the CDRs of the antibodies described herein have been determined according to the Kabat numbering scheme.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">As used herein, the term &#x201c;constant region&#x201d; or &#x201c;constant domain&#x201d; are interchangeable and have its meaning common in the art. The constant region is an antibody portion, e.g., a carboxyl terminal portion of a light and/or heavy chain which is not directly involved in binding of an antibody to antigen but which can exhibit various effector functions, such as interaction with the Fc receptor. The constant region of an immunoglobulin molecule generally has a more conserved amino acid sequence relative to an immunoglobulin variable domain.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">As used herein, the term &#x201c;heavy chain&#x201d; when used in reference to an antibody can refer to any distinct type, e.g., alpha (&#x3b1;), delta (&#x3b4;), epsilon (&#x3b5;), gamma (&#x3b3;), and mu (&#x3bc;), based on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain, which give rise to IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM classes of antibodies, respectively, including subclasses of IgG, e.g., IgG<sub>1</sub>, IgG<sub>2</sub>, IgG<sub>3</sub>, and IgG<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">As used herein, the term &#x201c;light chain&#x201d; when used in reference to an antibody can refer to any distinct type, e.g., kappa (&#x3ba;) or lambda (&#x3bb;) based on the amino acid sequence of the constant domains. Light chain amino acid sequences are well known in the art. In specific embodiments, the light chain is a human light chain.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">&#x201c;Binding affinity&#x201d; generally refers to the strength of the sum total of non-covalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, &#x201c;binding affinity&#x201d; refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). Affinity can be measured and/or expressed in a number of ways known in the art, including, but not limited to, equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>), and equilibrium association constant (K<sub>A</sub>). The K<sub>D </sub>is calculated from the quotient of k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>, whereas K<sub>A </sub>is calculated from the quotient of k<sub>on</sub>/k<sub>off</sub>. k<sub>on </sub>refers to the association rate constant of, e.g., an antibody to an antigen, and k<sub>off </sub>refers to the dissociation of, e.g., an antibody to an antigen. The k<sub>on </sub>and k<sub>off </sub>can be determined by techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as BIAcore&#xae; or KinExA.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">As used herein, a &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). In certain embodiments, one or more amino acid residues within a CDR(s) or within a framework region(s) of an antibody can be replaced with an amino acid residue with a similar side chain.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">As used herein, an &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; is a term in the art and refers to a localized region of an antigen to which an antibody can specifically bind. An epitope can be, for example, contiguous amino acids of a polypeptide (linear or contiguous epitope) or an epitope can, for example, come together from two or more non-contiguous regions of a polypeptide or polypeptides (conformational, non-linear, discontinuous, or non-contiguous epitope). In certain embodiments, the epitope to which an antibody binds can be determined by, e.g., NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction crystallography studies, ELISA assays, hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (e.g., liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry), array-based oligo-peptide scanning assays, and/or mutagenesis mapping (e.g., site-directed mutagenesis mapping). For X-ray crystallography, crystallization may be accomplished using any of the known methods in the art (e.g., Gieg&#xe9; R et al., (1994) Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 50(Pt 4): 339-350; McPherson A (1990) Eur J Biochem 189: 1-23; Chayen N E (1997) Structure 5: 1269-1274; McPherson A (1976) J Biol Chem 251: 6300-6303). Antibody:antigen crystals can be studied using well known X-ray diffraction techniques and can be refined using computer software such as X-PLOR (Yale University, 1992, distributed by Molecular Simulations, Inc.; see, e.g., Meth Enzymol (1985) volumes 114 &#x26; 115, eds Wyckoff H W et al.; U.S. 2004/0014194), and BUSTER (Bricogne G (1993) Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 49(Pt 1): 37-60; Bricogne G (1997) Meth Enzymol 276A: 361-423, ed Carter C W; Roversi P et al., (2000) Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 56(Pt 10): 1316-1323). Mutagenesis mapping studies can be accomplished using any method known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Champe M et al., (1995) J Biol Chem 270: 1388-1394 and Cunningham B C &#x26; Wells J A (1989) Science 244: 1081-1085 for a description of mutagenesis techniques, including alanine scanning mutagenesis techniques. In a specific embodiment, the epitope of an antibody is determined using alanine scanning mutagenesis studies.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;immunospecifically binds,&#x201d; &#x201c;immunospecifically recognizes,&#x201d; &#x201c;specifically binds,&#x201d; and &#x201c;specifically recognizes&#x201d; are analogous terms in the context of antibodies and refer to molecules that bind to an antigen (e.g., epitope or immune complex) as such binding is understood by one skilled in the art. For example, a molecule that specifically binds to an antigen can bind to other peptides or polypeptides, generally with lower affinity as determined by, e.g., immunoassays, BIAcore&#xae;, KinExA 3000 instrument (Sapidyne Instruments, Boise, Id.), or other assays known in the art. In a specific embodiment, molecules that immunospecifically bind to an antigen bind to the antigen with a K<sub>A </sub>that is at least 2 logs, 2.5 logs, 3 logs, 4 logs or greater than the K<sub>A </sub>when the molecules bind non-specifically to another antigen. In the context of antibodies with an anti-OX40 antigen-binding domain and a second antigen-binding domain that does not specifically bind to an antigen expressed by a human immune cell, the terms &#x201c;immunospecifically binds,&#x201d; &#x201c;immunospecifically recognizes,&#x201d; &#x201c;specifically binds,&#x201d; and &#x201c;specifically recognizes&#x201d; refer to antibodies that have distinct specificities for more than one antigen (i.e., OX40 and the antigen associated with the second antigen-binding domain).</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">In another specific embodiment, molecules that immunospecifically bind to an antigen do not cross react with other proteins under similar binding conditions. In another specific embodiment, molecules that immunospecifically bind to an antigen do not cross react with other non-OX40 proteins. In a specific embodiment, provided herein is an antibody that binds to OX40 with higher affinity than to another unrelated antigen.

A specific, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin S &#x26; Altschul S F (1990) PNAS 87: 2264-2268, modified as in Karlin S &#x26; Altschul S F (1993) PNAS 90: 5873-5877. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul S F et al., (1990) J Mol Biol 215: 403. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST nucleotide program parameters set, e.g., for score=100, wordlength=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules described herein. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program parameters set, e.g., to score 50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecule described herein. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul S F et al., (1997) Nuc Acids Res 25: 3389 3402. Alternatively, PSI BLAST can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules (Id.). When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI Blast programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., of XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used (see, e.g., National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) on the worldwide web, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Another specific, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller, 1988, CABIOS 4:11 17. Such an algorithm is incorporated in the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">The percent identity between two sequences can be determined using techniques similar to those described above, with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent identity, typically only exact matches are counted.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">As used herein, the term &#x201c;antigen-binding domain that does not bind to an antigen expressed by a human immune cell&#x201d; means that the antigen-binding domain does not bind to an antigen expressed by any human cell of hematopoietic origin that plays a role in the immune response. Immune cells include lymphocytes, such as B cells and T cells; natural killer cells; and myeloid cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and granulocytes. For example, such a binding domain would not bind to OX40, or any other members of the TNF receptor superfamily that are expressed by a human immune cell. However, the antigen-binding domain can bind to an antigen such as, but not limited to, an antigen expressed in other organisms and not humans (i.e., a non-human antigen); an antigen that is not expressed by wild-type human cells; or a viral antigen, including, but not limited to, an antigen from a virus that does not infect human cells, or a viral antigen that is absent in an uninfected human immune cell.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">5.2 Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0200" num="0199">In a specific aspect, provided herein are antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, such as chimeric, humanized, or human antibodies) which specifically bind to OX40 (e.g., human OX40).</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">In certain embodiments, an antibody described herein binds to human CD4+ T cells and human CD8+ T cells.

In certain embodiments, the epitope of an antibody can be determined by, e.g., NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction crystallography studies, ELISA assays, hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (e.g., liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry), array-based oligo-peptide scanning assays, and/or mutagenesis mapping (e.g., site-directed mutagenesis mapping). For X-ray crystallography, crystallization may be accomplished using any of the known methods in the art (e.g., Gieg&#xe9; R et al., (1994) Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 50(Pt 4): 339-350; McPherson A (1990) Eur J Biochem 189: 1-23; Chayen N E (1997) Structure 5: 1269-1274; McPherson A (1976) J Biol Chem 251: 6300-6303). Antibody:antigen crystals may be studied using well known X-ray diffraction techniques and may be refined using computer software such as X-PLOR (Yale University, 1992, distributed by Molecular Simulations, Inc.; see, e.g., Meth Enzymol (1985) volumes 114 &#x26; 115, eds Wyckoff H W et al.; U.S. Patent Application No. 2004/0014194), and BUSTER (Bricogne G (1993) Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 49(Pt 1): 37-60; Bricogne G (1997) Meth Enzymol 276A: 361-423, ed Carter C W; Roversi P et al., (2000) Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 56(Pt 10): 1316-1323). Mutagenesis mapping studies may be accomplished using any method known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Champe M et al., (1995) supra and Cunningham B C &#x26; Wells J A (1989) supra for a description of mutagenesis techniques, including alanine scanning mutagenesis techniques. In a specific embodiment, the epitope of an antibody is determined using alanine scanning mutagenesis studies. In addition, antibodies that recognize and bind to the same or overlapping epitopes of OX40 (e.g., human OX40) can be identified using routine techniques such as an immunoassay, for example, by showing the ability of one antibody to block the binding of another antibody to a target antigen, i.e., a competitive binding assay. Competition binding assays also can be used to determine whether two antibodies have similar binding specificity for an epitope. Competitive binding can be determined in an assay in which the immunoglobulin under test inhibits specific binding of a reference antibody to a common antigen, such as OX40. Numerous types of competitive binding assays are known, for example: solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (MA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see Stahli C et al., (1983) Methods Enzymol 9: 242-253); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see Kirkland T N et al., (1986) J Immunol 137: 3614-9); solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see Harlow E &#x26; Lane D, (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid phase direct label RIA using 1-125 label (see Morel G A et al., (1988) Mol Immunol 25(1): 7-15); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (Cheung R C et al., (1990) Virology 176: 546-52); and direct labeled RIA.

Typically, such an assay involves the use of purified antigen (e.g., OX40 such as human OX40) bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of these, an unlabeled test immunoglobulin and a labeled reference immunoglobulin. Competitive inhibition can be measured by determining the amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test immunoglobulin. Usually the test immunoglobulin is present in excess. Usually, when a competing antibody is present in excess, it will inhibit specific binding of a reference antibody to a common antigen by at least 50-55%, 55-60%, 60-65%, 65-70%, 70-75% or more. A competition binding assay can be configured in a large number of different formats using either labeled antigen or labeled antibody. In a common version of this assay, the antigen is immobilized on a 96-well plate. The ability of unlabeled antibodies to block the binding of labeled antibodies to the antigen is then measured using radioactive or enzyme labels.

Without being bound by theory, an anti-OX40 agonist antibody may mediate receptor clustering through bivalent antibody arms (i.e., two antibody arms that each bind OX40 antigen) and/or through Fc-Fc receptor (FcR) co-engagement on accessory myeloid or lymphoid cells. Consequently, one approach for developing an anti-OX40 antagonist antibody is to select an antibody that competes with OX40 ligand (OX40L) for binding to OX40, diminish or eliminate the binding of the Fc region of an antibody to Fc receptors, and/or adopt a monovalent antibody format. The monovalent antibody format can include antibodies that are structurally monovalent, such as, but not limited to, anti-OX40 antibodies comprising only one antigen-binding domain (e.g., only one Fab arm), or antibodies comprising only one antigen-binding domain that binds to OX40 (e.g., human OX40) that is paired with a heavy chain or that is paired with a fragment of a heavy chain (e.g., a Fc fragment). The monovalent antibody format can also include antibodies that are functionally monovalent, for example, antibodies comprising only one antigen-binding domain that binds to OX40 (e.g., human OX40) that is paired with a second-antigen binding domain that does not bind to an antigen expressed by a human immune cell (i.e., the antibody comprises two antigen-binding domains, but only one antigen-binding domain binds to OX40).</p><p id="p-0322" num="0315">Examples of mutations of the IgG constant domain Fc region are discussed above that can reduce Fc receptor binding or that can remove potential glycosylation sites.

Other methods for the preparation of clonal cell lines and of monoclonal antibodies expressed thereby are well known in the art (see, for example, Chapter 11 in: Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, (2002) 5th Ed., Ausubel F M et al., supra).</p><p id="p-0346" num="0339">Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. For example, in the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a sheep, goat, rabbit, rat, hamster or macaque monkey, is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein (e.g., OX40 (e.g., human OX40)) used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding J W (Ed), Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Additionally, a RIMIS (repetitive immunization multiple sites) technique can be used to immunize an animal (Kilpatrick K E et al., (1997) Hybridoma 16:381-9, incorporated by reference in its entirety).</p><p id="p-0347" num="0340">In some embodiments, mice (or other animals, such as rats, monkeys, donkeys, pigs, sheep, hamster, or dogs) can be immunized with an antigen (e.g., OX40 (e.g., human OX40)) and once an immune response is detected, e.g., antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells, for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC&#xae;) (Manassas, Va.), to form hybridomas. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. In certain embodiments, lymph nodes of the immunized mice are harvested and fused with NS0 myeloma cells.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0341">The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0342">Specific embodiments employ myeloma cells that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as NS0 cell line or those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif., USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8.653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md., USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor D (1984) J Immunol 133: 3001-5; Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).</p><p id="p-0350" num="0343">Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against OX40 (e.g., human OX40). The binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by methods known in the art, for example, immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (MA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA).</p><p id="p-0351" num="0344">After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding J W (Ed), Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, supra). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0345">The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0346">Antibodies described herein can be generated by any technique known to those of skill in the art. For example, Fab and F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments described herein can be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments). A Fab fragment corresponds to one of the two identical arms of a tetrameric antibody molecule and contains the complete light chain paired with the VH and CH1 domains of the heavy chain. A F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment contains the two antigen-binding arms of a tetrameric antibody molecule linked by disulfide bonds in the hinge region.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0347">Further, the antibodies described herein can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods, proteins are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In particular, DNA sequences encoding VH and VL domains are amplified from animal cDNA libraries (e.g., human or murine cDNA libraries of affected tissues). The DNA encoding the VH and VL domains are recombined together with a scFv linker by PCR and cloned into a phagemid vector. The vector is electroporated in <i>E. coli </i>and the <i>E. coli </i>is infected with helper phage. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13, and the VH and VL domains are usually recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII. Phage expressing an antibody that binds to a particular antigen can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead.

In particular embodiments, an antibody described herein, which competitively blocks (e.g., in a dose-dependent manner) any one of the antibodies described herein, (e.g., pab1949 or pab2044) from binding to OX40 (e.g., human OX40), is a human antibody. Human antibodies can be produced using any method known in the art. For example, transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes, can be used. In particular, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes can be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region can be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes can be rendered non-functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the J<sub>H </sub>region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of an antigen (e.g., OX40). Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies.

Hybridization under other stringent hybridization conditions are known to those of skill in the art and have been described, see, for example, Ausubel F M et al., eds., (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. I, Green Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc., New York at pages 6.3.1-6.3.6 and 2.10.3.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">5.3.2 Cells and Vectors</heading><p id="p-0389" num="0382">In certain aspects, provided herein are cells (e.g., host cells) expressing (e.g., recombinantly) antibodies described herein which specifically bind to OX40 (e.g., human OX40) and related polynucleotides and expression vectors. Provided herein are vectors (e.g., expression vectors) comprising polynucleotides comprising nucleotide sequences encoding anti-OX40 antibodies or a fragment for recombinant expression in host cells, preferably in mammalian cells. Also provided herein are host cells comprising such vectors for recombinantly expressing anti-OX40 antibodies described herein (e.g., human or humanized antibody). In a particular aspect, provided herein are methods for producing an antibody described herein, comprising expressing such antibody in a host cell.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0383">Recombinant expression of an antibody or fragment thereof described herein (e.g., a heavy or light chain of an antibody described herein) that specifically binds to OX40 (e.g., human OX40) involves construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody or fragment. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody or fragment thereof (e.g., heavy or light chain variable domains) described herein has been obtained, the vector for the production of the antibody molecule can be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus, methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., light chain or heavy chain) encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., light chain or heavy chain) coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. Also provided are replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule described herein, a heavy or light chain of an antibody, a heavy or light chain variable domain of an antibody or a fragment thereof, or a heavy or light chain CDR, operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors can, for example, include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule (see, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 86/05807 and WO 89/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464) and variable domains of the antibody can be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy, the entire light chain, or both the entire heavy and light chains.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0384">An expression vector can be transferred to a cell (e.g., host cell) by conventional techniques and the resulting cells can then be cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody described herein (e.g., an antibody comprising the CDRs of pab1949 or pab2044) or a fragment thereof. Thus, provided herein are host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody described herein (e.g., an antibody comprising the CDRs of pab1949 or pab2044) or fragments thereof (e.g., a heavy or light chain thereof, or fragment thereof), operably linked to a promoter for expression of such sequences in the host cell. In certain embodiments, for the expression of double-chained antibodies, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains, individually, can be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below. In certain embodiments, a host cell contains a vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding both the heavy chain and light chain of an antibody described herein (e.g., an antibody comprising the CDRs of pab1949 or pab2044), or a fragment thereof. In specific embodiments, a host cell contains two different vectors, a first vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a heavy chain or a heavy chain variable region of an antibody described herein (e.g., an antibody comprising the CDRs of pab1949 or pab2044), or a fragment thereof, and a second vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a light chain or a light chain variable region of an antibody described herein (e.g., an antibody comprising the CDRs of pab1949 or pab2044), or a fragment thereof. In other embodiments, a first host cell comprises a first vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a heavy chain or a heavy chain variable region of an antibody described herein (e.g., an antibody comprising the CDRs of pab1949 or pab2044), or a fragment thereof, and a second host cell comprises a second vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a light chain or a light chain variable region of an antibody described herein (e.g., an antibody comprising the CDRs of pab1949 or pab2044). In specific embodiments, a heavy chain/heavy chain variable region expressed by a first cell associated with a light chain/light chain variable region of a second cell to form an anti-OX40 antibody described herein (e.g., antibody comprising the CDRs pab1949 or pab2044). In certain embodiments, provided herein is a population of host cells comprising such first host cell and such second host cell.</p><p id="p-0392" num="0385">In a particular embodiment, provided herein is a population of vectors comprising a first vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a light chain/light chain variable region of an anti-OX40 antibody described herein (e.g., antibody comprising the CDRs of pab1949 or pab2044), and a second vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a heavy chain/heavy chain variable region of an anti-OX40 antibody described herein (e.g., antibody comprising the CDRs of pab1949 or pab2044).</p><p id="p-0393" num="0386">A variety of host-expression vector systems can be utilized to express antibody molecules described herein (e.g., an antibody comprising the CDRs of pab1949 or pab2044) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,715). Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest can be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which can, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express an antibody molecule described herein in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., <i>E. coli </i>and <i>B. subtilis</i>) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; yeast (e.g., <i>Saccharomyces Pichia</i>) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing antibody coding sequences; plant cell systems (e.g., green algae such as <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>) infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing antibody coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS (e.g., COS1 or COS), CHO, BHK, MDCK, HEK 293, NS0, PER.C6, VERO, CRL7O3O, HsS78Bst, HeLa, and NIH 3T3, HEK-293T, HepG2, SP210, R1.1, B-W, L-M, BSC1, BSC40, YB/20 and BMT10 cells) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter). In a specific embodiment, cells for expressing antibodies described herein (e.g., an antibody comprising the CDRs of any one of antibodies pab1949 or pab2044) are CHO cells, for example CHO cells from the CHO GS System&#x2122; (Lonza). In a particular embodiment, cells for expressing antibodies described herein are human cells, e.g., human cell lines. In a specific embodiment, a mammalian expression vector is pOptiVEC&#x2122; or pcDNA3.3. In a particular embodiment, bacterial cells such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>, or eukaryotic cells (e.g., mammalian cells), especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule, are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies (Foecking M K &#x26; Hofstetter H (1986) Gene 45: 101-105; and Cockett M I et al., (1990) Biotechnology 8: 662-667). In certain embodiments, antibodies described herein are produced by CHO cells or NS0 cells. In a specific embodiment, the expression of nucleotide sequences encoding antibodies described herein which immunospecifically bind OX40 (e.g., human OX40) is regulated by a constitutive promoter, inducible promoter or tissue specific promoter.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0387">In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors can be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such an antibody is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified can be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited to, the <i>E. coli </i>expression vector pUR278 (Ruether U &#x26; Mueller-Hill B (1983) EMBO J 2: 1791-1794), in which the antibody coding sequence can be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye S &#x26; Inouye M (1985) Nuc Acids Res 13: 3101-3109; Van Heeke G &#x26; Schuster S M (1989) J Biol Chem 24: 5503-5509); and the like. For example, pGEX vectors can also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione 5-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0388">In an insect system, <i>Autographa californica </i>nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV), for example, can be used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in <i>Spodoptera frugiperda </i>cells. The antibody coding sequence can be cloned individually into non-essential regions (for example the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example the polyhedrin promoter).</p><p id="p-0396" num="0389">In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems can be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest can be ligated to an adenovirus transcription/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene can then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts (e.g., see Logan J &#x26; Shenk T (1984) PNAS 81: 3655-3659). Specific initiation signals can also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression can be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see, e.g., Bitter G et al., (1987) Methods Enzymol 153: 516-544).</p><p id="p-0397" num="0390">In addition, a host cell strain can be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products can be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product can be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERO, BHK, Hela, MDCK, HEK 293, NIH 3T3, W138, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT2O and T47D, NS0 (a murine myeloma cell line that does not endogenously produce any immunoglobulin chains), CRL7O3O, COS (e.g., COS1 or COS), PER.C6, VERO, HsS78Bst, HEK-293T, HepG2, SP210, R1.1, B-W, L-M, BSC1, BSC40, YB/20, BMT10 and HsS78Bst cells. In certain embodiments, anti-OX40 antibodies described herein (e.g., an antibody comprising the CDRs of pab1949 or pab2044) are produced in mammalian cells, such as CHO cells.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0391">In a specific embodiment, the antibodies described herein have reduced fucose content or no fucose content. Such antibodies can be produced using techniques known one skilled in the art. For example, the antibodies can be expressed in cells deficient or lacking the ability of to fucosylate. In a specific example, cell lines with a knockout of both alleles of a1,6-fucosyltransferase can be used to produce antibodies with reduced fucose content. The Potelligent&#xae; system (Lonza) is an example of such a system that can be used to produce antibodies with reduced fucose content.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0392">For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression cells can be generated. For example, cell lines which stably express an anti-OX40 antibody described herein (e.g., an antibody comprising the CDRs of pab1949 or pab2044) can be engineered. In specific embodiments, a cell provided herein stably expresses a light chain/light chain variable domain and a heavy chain/heavy chain variable domain which associate to form an antibody described herein (e.g., an antibody comprising the CDRs of pab1949 or pab2044).</p><p id="p-0400" num="0393">In certain aspects, rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA/polynucleotide, engineered cells can be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method can advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express an anti-OX40 antibody described herein or a fragment thereof. Such engineered cell lines can be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compositions that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0394">A number of selection systems can be used, including but not limited to, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler M et al., (1977) Cell 11(1): 223-232), hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska E H &#x26; Szybalski W (1962) PNAS 48(12): 2026-2034) and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy I et al., (1980) Cell 22(3): 817-823) genes can be employed in tk-, hgprt- or aprt-cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler M et al., (1980) PNAS 77(6): 3567-3570; O'Hare K et al., (1981) PNAS 78: 1527-1531); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan R C &#x26; Berg P (1981) PNAS 78(4): 2072-2076); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (Wu G Y &#x26; Wu C H (1991) Biotherapy 3: 87-95; Tolstoshev P (1993) Ann Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 32: 573-596; Mulligan R C (1993) Science 260: 926-932; and Morgan R A &#x26; Anderson W F (1993) Ann Rev Biochem 62: 191-217; Nabel G J &#x26; Felgner P L (1993) Trends Biotechnol 11(5): 211-215); and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre R F et al., (1984) Gene 30(1-3): 147-156). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology can be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone and such methods are described, for example, in Ausubel F M et al., (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, N Y (1993); Kriegler M, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, N Y (1990); and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli N C et al., (eds.), Current Protocols in Human Genetics, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, N Y (1994); Colb&#xe9;re-Garapin F et al., (1981) J Mol Biol 150: 1-14, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0395">The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington C R &#x26; Hentschel C C G, The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA cloning, Vol. 3 (Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse G F et al., (1983) Mol Cell Biol 3: 257-66).</p><p id="p-0403" num="0396">The host cell can be co-transfected with two or more expression vectors described herein, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors can contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. The host cells can be co-transfected with different amounts of the two or more expression vectors. For example, host cells can be transfected with any one of the following ratios of a first expression vector and a second expression vector: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9, 1:10, 1:12, 1:15, 1:20, 1:25, 1:30, 1:35, 1:40, 1:45, or 1:50.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0397">Alternatively, a single vector can be used which encodes, and is capable of expressing, both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot N J (1986) Nature 322: 562-565; and K&#xf6;hler G (1980) PNAS 77: 2197-2199). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains can comprise cDNA or genomic DNA. The expression vector can be monocistronic or multicistronic. A multicistronic nucleic acid construct can encode 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more, or in the range of 2-5, 5-10 or 10-20 genes/nucleotide sequences. For example, a bicistronic nucleic acid construct can comprise in the following order a promoter, a first gene (e.g., heavy chain of an antibody described herein), and a second gene and (e.g., light chain of an antibody described herein). In such an expression vector, the transcription of both genes can be driven by the promoter, whereas the translation of the mRNA from the first gene can be by a cap-dependent scanning mechanism and the translation of the mRNA from the second gene can be by a cap-independent mechanism, e.g., by an IRES.</p><p id="p-0405" num="0398">Once an antibody molecule described herein has been produced by recombinant expression, it can be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Further, the antibodies described herein can be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art to facilitate purification.</p><p id="p-0406" num="0399">In specific embodiments, an antibody described herein is isolated or purified. Generally, an isolated antibody is one that is substantially free of other antibodies with different antigenic specificities than the isolated antibody. For example, in a particular embodiment, a preparation of an antibody described herein is substantially free of cellular material and/or chemical precursors. The language &#x201c;substantially free of cellular material&#x201d; includes preparations of an antibody in which the antibody is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. Thus, an antibody that is substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of antibody having less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1% (by dry weight) of heterologous protein (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;contaminating protein&#x201d;) and/or variants of an antibody, for example, different post-translational modified forms of an antibody. When the antibody or fragment is recombinantly produced, it is also generally substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, 10%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1% of the volume of the protein preparation. When the antibody or fragment is produced by chemical synthesis, it is generally substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals, i.e., it is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals which are involved in the synthesis of the protein. Accordingly, such preparations of the antibody or fragment have less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, or 5% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or compounds other than the antibody or fragment of interest.

In a specific embodiment, an anti-OX40 antibody is administered to a subject in combination with a heat shock protein based tumor-vaccine. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of highly conserved proteins found ubiquitously across all species. Their expression can be powerfully induced to much higher levels as a result of heat shock or other forms of stress, including exposure to toxins, oxidative stress or glucose deprivation. Five families have been classified according to molecular weight: HSP-110, -90, -70, -60 and -28. HSPs deliver immunogenic peptides through the cross-presentation pathway in antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), leading to T cell activation. HSPs function as chaperone carriers of tumor-associated antigenic peptides forming complexes able to induce tumor-specific immunity. Upon release from dying tumor cells, the HSP-antigen complexes are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) wherein the antigens are processed into peptides that bind WIC class I and class II molecules leading to the activation of anti-tumor CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The immunity elicited by HSP complexes derived from tumor preparations is specifically directed against the unique antigenic peptide repertoire expressed by the cancer of each subject.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0418">A heat shock protein peptide complex (HSPPC) is a protein peptide complex consisting of a heat shock protein non-covalently complexed with antigenic peptides. HSPPCs elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses. In a specific embodiment, the antigenic peptide(s) displays antigenicity for the cancer being treated. HSPPCs are efficiently seized by APCs via membrane receptors (mainly CD91) or by binding to Toll-like receptors. HSPPC internalization results in functional maturation of the APCs with chemokine and cytokine production leading to activation of natural killer cells (NK), monocytes and Th1 and Th-2-mediated immune responses. In some embodiments, HSPPCs used in methods disclosed herein comprise one or more heat shock proteins from the hsp60, hsp70, or hsp90 family of stress proteins complexed with antigenic peptides.

HSPPC-96 is a cancer immunotherapy manufactured from a subject's tumor and contains the cancer's antigenic &#x201c;fingerprint.&#x201d; In some embodiments, this fingerprint contains unique antigens that are present only in that particular subject's specific cancer cells and injection of the vaccine is intended to stimulate the subject's immune system to recognize and attack any cells with the specific cancer fingerprint.</p><p id="p-0427" num="0420">In some embodiments, the HSPPC, e.g., HSPPC-96, is produced from the tumor tissue of a subject.

In some embodiments, after surgical resection, non-necrotic tumor tissue is frozen prior to use in vaccine preparation. In some embodiments, the HSPPC, e.g., HSPPC-96, is isolated from the tumor tissue by purification techniques, filtered and prepared for an injectable vaccine. In some embodiments, a subject is administered 6-12 doses of the HSPPC, e.g., HSPCC-96.

In a preferred embodiment of an antibody or pharmaceutical composition for use in a method for the treatment of an autoimmune or inflammatory disease or disorder, or of an infectious disease, the antibody is antagonistic.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">5.5.1.1 Routes of Administration &#x26; Dosage</heading><p id="p-0435" num="0428">An antibody or composition described herein can be delivered to a subject by a variety of routes, such as parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intradermal, transdermal, intranasal, intratumoral, and administration to a tumor draining lymph node. In one embodiment, the antibody or composition is administered by an intravenous or intratumoral route.</p><p id="p-0436" num="0429">The amount of an antibody or composition which will be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of a condition will depend on the nature of the disease, and can be determined by standard clinical techniques.</p><p id="p-0437" num="0430">The precise dose to be employed in a composition will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each subject's circumstances. For example, effective doses may also vary depending upon means of administration, target site, physiological state of the patient (including age, body weight and health), whether the patient is human or an animal, other medications administered, or whether treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. Usually, the patient is a human but non-human mammals including transgenic mammals can also be treated. Treatment dosages are optimally titrated to optimize safety and efficacy.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0431">In certain embodiments, an in vitro assay is employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.</p><p id="p-0439" num="0432">Generally, human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus, lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">5.5.2 Detection &#x26; Diagnostic Uses</heading><p id="p-0440" num="0433">An anti-OX40 antibody described herein (see, e.g., Section 5.2) can be used to assay OX40 protein levels in a biological sample using classical immunohistological methods known to those of skill in the art, including immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoprecipitation, or Western blotting. Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase; radioisotopes, such as iodine (125I, <sup>121</sup>I) carbon (<sup>14</sup>C), sulfur (<sup>35</sup>S), tritium (<sup>3</sup>H), indium (<sup>121</sup>In), and technetium (<sup>99</sup>Tc); luminescent labels, such as luminol; and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin. Such labels can be used to label an antibody described herein. Alternatively, a second antibody that recognizes an anti-OX40 antibody described herein can be labeled and used in combination with an anti-OX40 antibody to detect OX40 protein levels.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0434">Assaying for the expression level of OX40 protein is intended to include qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of a OX40 protein in a first biological sample either directly (e.g., by determining or estimating absolute protein level) or relatively (e.g., by comparing to the disease associated protein level in a second biological sample). OX40 polypeptide expression level in the first biological sample can be measured or estimated and compared to a standard OX40 protein level, the standard being taken from a second biological sample obtained from an individual not having the disorder or being determined by averaging levels from a population of individuals not having the disorder. As will be appreciated in the art, once the &#x201c;standard&#x201d; OX40 polypeptide level is known, it can be used repeatedly as a standard for comparison.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0435">As used herein, the term &#x201c;biological sample&#x201d; refers to any biological sample obtained from a subject, cell line, tissue, or other source of cells potentially expressing OX40. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from animals (e.g., humans) are well known in the art. Biological samples include peripheral mononuclear blood cells.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0436">An anti-OX40 antibody described herein can be used for prognostic, diagnostic, monitoring and screening applications, including in vitro and in vivo applications well known and standard to the skilled artisan and based on the present description. Prognostic, diagnostic, monitoring and screening assays and kits for in vitro assessment and evaluation of immune system status and/or immune response may be utilized to predict, diagnose and monitor to evaluate patient samples including those known to have or suspected of having an immune system-dysfunction or with regard to an anticipated or desired immune system response, antigen response or vaccine response. The assessment and evaluation of immune system status and/or immune response is also useful in determining the suitability of a patient for a clinical trial of a drug or for the administration of a particular chemotherapeutic agent or an antibody, including combinations thereof, versus a different agent or antibody. This type of prognostic and diagnostic monitoring and assessment is already in practice utilizing antibodies against the HER2 protein in breast cancer (HercepTest&#x2122;, Dako) where the assay is also used to evaluate patients for antibody therapy using Herceptin&#xae;. In vivo applications include directed cell therapy and immune system modulation and radio imaging of immune responses.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0437">In one embodiment, an anti-OX40 antibody can be used in immunohistochemistry of biopsy samples.</p><p id="p-0445" num="0438">In another embodiment, an anti-OX40 antibody can be used to detect levels of OX40, or levels of cells which contain OX40 on their membrane surface, which levels can then be linked to certain disease symptoms. Anti-OX40 antibodies described herein may carry a detectable or functional label. When fluorescence labels are used, currently available microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (FACS) or combination of both methods procedures known in the art may be utilized to identify and to quantitate the specific binding members.

When radioactive labels are used, currently available counting procedures known in the art may be utilized to identify and quantitate the specific binding of anti-OX40 antibody to OX40 (e.g., human OX40). In the instance where the label is an enzyme, detection may be accomplished by any of the presently utilized colorimetric, spectrophotometric, fluorospectrophotometric, amperometric or gasometric techniques as known in the art. This can be achieved by contacting a sample or a control sample with an anti-OX40 antibody under conditions that allow for the formation of a complex between the antibody and OX40.

For the generation of library inserts, the total RNA was extracted via phenol/chloroform from FACS sorted CD19 positive human B lymphocytes originated from two cord blood samples. The total RNA of each cord blood sample (1 &#x3bc;g) was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit from Fermentas (Cat. No. K1621 and K1622). Antibody variable regions were amplified from the cDNA by PCR and cloned into retroviral expression vectors (pCMA). These constructs were subsequently used to transduce preB cells to express antibodies on the surface using Retrocyte Display&#x2122; technology. The retroviral expression vector contained 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; LTRs, immunoglobulin constant region (IGHG1 or IGKC) comprising membrane anchor fraction (IGHG1) and a CD4 surface maker gene.</p><p id="p-0454" num="0447">The light chain variable regions (VHs) were amplified by semi-nested PCR using V&#x3ba; family-specific forward primers and a mixture of reverse primers.

The precipitated VH and V&#x3ba; ligation reactions were also separately transformed into <i>E. coli </i>DH10B cells for library generation. The separate ligation, precipitation and transformation of each VH and V&#x3ba; family allow the library to mirror the natural distribution of functional germline genes, ensuring that the VH or V&#x3ba; families with a high number of functional germline genes are highly represented in the final library compared with families with a lower number of functional germline genes.
