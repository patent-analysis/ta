The present invention also relates to bispecific antigen-binding molecules that bind MUC16 and CD3, and methods of use thereof. The present invention further relates to antibody-drug conjugates comprising an anti-MUC16 antibody or fragment thereof and a therapeutic agent (e.g., a cytotoxic agent).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mucin 16 (MUC16), also known as cancer antigen 125, carcinoma antigen 125, carbohydrate antigen 125, or CA-125, is a single transmembrane domain highly glycosylated integral membrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed in ovarian cancer. MUC16 consists of three major domains: an extracellular N-terminal domain, a large tandem repeat domain interspersed with sea urchin sperm, enterokinase, and agrin (SEA) domains, and a carboxyl terminal domain that comprises a segment of the transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail. Proteolytic cleavage results in shedding of much of the extracellular portion of MUC16 into the bloodstream. MUC16 is overexpressed in cancers including ovarian cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma-mass forming type, adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix, and adenocarcinoma of the gastric tract, and in diseases and conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, liver cirrhosis, cardiac failure, peritoneal infection, and abdominal surgery. (Haridas, D. et al., 2014, FASEB J., 28:4183-4199). Expression on cancer cells is shown to protect tumor cells from the immune system. (Felder, M. et al., 2014, Molecular Cancer, 13:129) Methods for treating ovarian cancer using antibodies to MUC16 have been investigated. Oregovomab and abgovomab are anti-MUC16 antibodies which have had limited success. (Felder, supra, Das, S. and Batra, S. K. 2015, Cancer Res. 75:4660-4674.)</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">CD3 is a homodimeric or heterodimeric antigen expressed on T cells in association with the T cell receptor complex (TCR) and is required for T cell activation. Functional CD3 is formed from the dimeric association of two of four different chains: epsilon, zeta, delta and gamma. The CD3 dimeric arrangements include gamma/epsilon, delta/epsilon and zeta/zeta. Antibodies against CD3 have been shown to cluster CD3 on T cells, thereby causing T cell activation in a manner similar to the engagement of the TCR by peptide-loaded MHC molecules. Thus, anti-CD3 antibodies have been proposed for therapeutic purposes involving the activation of T cells. In addition, bispecific antibodies that are capable of binding CD3 and a target antigen have been proposed for therapeutic uses involving targeting T cell immune responses to tissues and cells expressing the target antigen.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Antigen-binding molecules that target MUC16, including antibody-drug conjugates, as well as bispecific antigen-binding molecules that bind both MUC16 and CD3 would be useful in therapeutic settings in which specific targeting and T cell-mediated killing of cells that express MUC16 is desired.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a first aspect, the present invention provides antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof that bind to human MUC16. The antibodies according to this aspect of the invention are useful, inter alia, for targeting cells expressing MUC16. The present invention also provides bispecific antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof that bind human MUC16 and human CD3. The bispecific antibodies according to this aspect of the invention are useful, inter alia, for targeting T cells expressing CD3, and for stimulating T cell activation, e.g., under circumstances where T cell-mediated killing of cells expressing MUC16 is beneficial or desirable. For example, the bispecific antibodies can direct CD3-mediated T cell activation to specific MUC16-expressing cells, such as ovarian tumor cells.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Exemplary anti-MUC16 antibodies of the present invention are listed in Tables 1 and 2 herein.

Such bispecific antigen-binding molecules are also referred to herein as &#x201c;anti-MUC16/anti-CD3 bispecific molecules,&#x201d; &#x201c;anti-CD3/anti-MUC16 bispecific molecules,&#x201d; or &#x201c;MUC16&#xd7;CD3 bsAbs.&#x201d; The anti-MUC16 portion of the anti-MUC16/anti-CD3 bispecific molecule is useful for targeting cells (e.g., tumor cells) that express MUC16 (e.g., ovarian tumors), and the anti-CD3 portion of the bispecific molecule is useful for activating T-cells. The simultaneous binding of MUC16 on a tumor cell and CD3 on a T-cell facilitates directed killing (cell lysis) of the targeted tumor cell by the activated T-cell. The anti-MUC16/anti-CD3 bispecific molecules of the invention are therefore useful, inter alia, for treating diseases and disorders related to or caused by MUC16-expressing tumors (e.g., ovarian cancers).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0061">The bispecific antigen-binding molecules according to this aspect of the present invention comprise a first antigen-binding domain that specifically binds human CD3, and a second antigen-binding domain that specifically binds MUC16. The present invention includes anti-MUC16/anti-CD3 bispecific molecules (e.g., bispecific antibodies) wherein each antigen-binding domain comprises a heavy chain variable region (HCVR) paired with a light chain variable region (LCVR). In certain exemplary embodiments of the invention, the anti-CD3 antigen-binding domain and the anti-MUC16 antigen binding domain each comprise different, distinct HCVRs paired with a common LCVR. For example, as illustrated in Example 3 herein, bispecific antibodies were constructed comprising a first antigen-binding domain that specifically binds CD3, wherein the first antigen-binding domain comprises an HCVR derived from an anti-CD3 antibody paired with an LCVR derived from an anti-MUC16 antibody (e.g., the same LCVR that is included in the anti-MUC16 antigen-binding domain); and a second antigen-binding domain that specifically binds MUC16, wherein the second antigen-binding domain comprises an HCVR/LCVR derived from an anti-MUC16 antibody. In other words, in the exemplary molecules disclosed herein, the pairing of an HCVR from an anti-CD3 antibody with an LCVR from an anti-MUC16 antibody creates an antigen-binding domain that specifically binds CD3 (but does not bind MUC16). In such embodiments, the first and second antigen-binding domains comprise distinct anti-CD3 and anti-MUC16 HCVRs but share a common anti-MUC16 LCVR. In other embodiments, the bispecific antigen-binding molecules comprise distinct anti-CD3 and anti-MUC16 HCVRs, but share a common LCVR. The amino acid sequence of this LCVR is shown, e.g., in SEQ ID NO:1890, and the amino acid sequences of the corresponding CDRs (i.e., LCDR1-LCDR2-LCDR3) are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 1892, 1894 and 1896, respectively. Genetically modified mice can be used to produce fully human bispecific antigen-binding molecules comprising two different heavy chains that associate with an identical light chain that comprises a variable domain derived from one of two different human light chain variable region gene segments. Alternatively, variable heavy chains may be paired with one common light chain and expressed recombinantly in host cells. As such, the antibodies of the invention can comprise immunoglobulin heavy chains associated with a single rearranged light chain. In some embodiments, the light chain comprises a variable domain derived from a human V&#x3ba;1-39 gene segment or a V&#x3ba;3-20 gene segment. In other embodiments, the light chain comprises a variable domain derived from a human V&#x3ba;1-39 gene segment rearranged with a human J&#x3ba;5 or a human J&#x3ba;1 gene segment.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0062">The present invention provides anti-CD3/anti-MUC16 bispecific molecules, wherein the first antigen-binding domain that specifically binds CD3 comprises any of the HCVR amino acid sequences, any of the LCVR amino acid sequences, any of the HCVR/LCVR amino acid sequence pairs, any of the heavy chain CDR1-CDR2-CDR3 amino acid sequences, or any of the light chain CDR1-CDR2-CDR3 amino acid sequences as set forth in US publication 2014/0088295 published Mar. 27, 2014 and PCT/US2016/044732 filed Jul. 29, 2016.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0063">In addition, the present invention provides anti-CD3/anti-MUC16 bispecific molecules, wherein the first antigen-binding domain that specifically binds CD3 comprises any of the HCVR amino acid sequences as set forth in Tables 16, 18, and 22 herein.

It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited only by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0121">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. As used herein, the term &#x201c;about,&#x201d; when used in reference to a particular recited numerical value, means that the value may vary from the recited value by no more than 1%. For example, as used herein, the expression &#x201c;about 100&#x201d; includes 99 and 101 and all values in between (e.g., 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, etc.).</p><p id="p-0138" num="0122">Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are now described. All patents, applications and non-patent publications mentioned in this specification are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0139" num="0123">The expression &#x201c;CD3,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to an antigen which is expressed on T cells as part of the multimolecular T cell receptor (TCR) and which consists of a homodimer or heterodimer formed from the association of two of four receptor chains: CD3-epsilon, CD3-delta, CD3-zeta, and CD3-gamma. Human CD3-epsilon comprises the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1897; human CD3-delta comprises the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1898. All references to proteins, polypeptides and protein fragments herein are intended to refer to the human version of the respective protein, polypeptide or protein fragment unless explicitly specified as being from a non-human species. Thus, the expression &#x201c;CD3&#x201d; means human CD3 unless specified as being from a non-human species, e.g., &#x201c;mouse CD3,&#x201d; &#x201c;monkey CD3,&#x201d; etc.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0124">As used herein, &#x201c;an antibody that binds CD3&#x201d; or an &#x201c;anti-CD3 antibody&#x201d; includes antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof that specifically recognize a single CD3 subunit (e.g., epsilon, delta, gamma or zeta), as well as antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof that specifically recognize a dimeric complex of two CD3 subunits (e.g., gamma/epsilon, delta/epsilon, and zeta/zeta CD3 dimers). The antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of the present invention may bind soluble CD3 and/or cell surface expressed CD3. Soluble CD3 includes natural CD3 proteins as well as recombinant CD3 protein variants such as, e.g., monomeric and dimeric CD3 constructs, that lack a transmembrane domain or are otherwise unassociated with a cell membrane.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0125">As used herein, the expression &#x201c;cell surface-expressed CD3&#x201d; means one or more CD3 protein(s) that is/are expressed on the surface of a cell in vitro or in vivo, such that at least a portion of a CD3 protein is exposed to the extracellular side of the cell membrane and is accessible to an antigen-binding portion of an antibody. &#x201c;Cell surface-expressed CD3&#x201d; includes CD3 proteins contained within the context of a functional T cell receptor in the membrane of a cell. The expression &#x201c;cell surface-expressed CD3&#x201d; includes CD3 protein expressed as part of a homodimer or heterodimer on the surface of a cell (e.g., gamma/epsilon, delta/epsilon, and zeta/zeta CD3 dimers). The expression, &#x201c;cell surface-expressed CD3&#x201d; also includes a CD3 chain (e.g., CD3-epsilon, CD3-delta or CD3-gamma) that is expressed by itself, without other CD3 chain types, on the surface of a cell. A &#x201c;cell surface-expressed CD3&#x201d; can comprise or consist of a CD3 protein expressed on the surface of a cell which normally expresses CD3 protein. Alternatively, &#x201c;cell surface-expressed CD3&#x201d; can comprise or consist of CD3 protein expressed on the surface of a cell that normally does not express human CD3 on its surface but has been artificially engineered to express CD3 on its surface.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0126">The expression &#x201c;MUC16,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to mucin 16. MUC16 is a single transmembrane domain highly glycosylated integral membrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed in ovarian cancer. The amino acid sequence of human MUC16 is set forth in SEQ ID NO:1899.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0127">As used herein, &#x201c;an antibody that binds MUC16&#x201d; or an &#x201c;anti-MUC16 antibody&#x201d; includes antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof that specifically recognize MUC16.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0128">The term &#x201c;antigen-binding molecule&#x201d; includes antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of antibodies, including, e.g., bispecific antibodies.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0129">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, means any antigen-binding molecule or molecular complex comprising at least one complementarity determining region (CDR) that specifically binds to or interacts with a particular antigen (e.g., MUC16 or CD3). The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; includes immunoglobulin molecules comprising four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds, as well as multimers thereof (e.g., IgM). Each heavy chain comprises a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as HCVR or V<sub>H</sub>) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region comprises three domains, C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2 and C<sub>H</sub>3. Each light chain comprises a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as LCVR or V<sub>L</sub>) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region comprises one domain (C<sub>L</sub>1). The V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. In different embodiments of the invention, the FRs of the anti-MUC16 antibody or anti-CD3 antibody (or antigen-binding portion thereof) may be identical to the human germline sequences, or may be naturally or artificially modified. An amino acid consensus sequence may be defined based on a side-by-side analysis of two or more CDRs.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0130">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, also includes antigen-binding fragments of full antibody molecules. The terms &#x201c;antigen-binding portion&#x201d; of an antibody, &#x201c;antigen-binding fragment&#x201d; of an antibody, and the like, as used herein, include any naturally occurring, enzymatically obtainable, synthetic, or genetically engineered polypeptide or glycoprotein that specifically binds an antigen to form a complex. Antigen-binding fragments of an antibody may be derived, e.g., from full antibody molecules using any suitable standard techniques such as proteolytic digestion or recombinant genetic engineering techniques involving the manipulation and expression of DNA encoding antibody variable and optionally constant domains. Such DNA is known and/or is readily available from, e.g., commercial sources, DNA libraries (including, e.g., phage-antibody libraries), or can be synthesized. The DNA may be sequenced and manipulated chemically or by using molecular biology techniques, for example, to arrange one or more variable and/or constant domains into a suitable configuration, or to introduce codons, create cysteine residues, modify, add or delete amino acids, etc.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0131">Non-limiting examples of antigen-binding fragments include: (i) Fab fragments; (ii) F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragments; (iii) Fd fragments; (iv) Fv fragments; (v) single-chain Fv (scFv) molecules; (vi) dAb fragments; and (vii) minimal recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues that mimic the hypervariable region of an antibody (e.g., an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR) such as a CDR3 peptide), or a constrained FR3-CDR3-FR4 peptide. Other engineered molecules, such as domain-specific antibodies, single domain antibodies, domain-deleted antibodies, chimeric antibodies, CDR-grafted antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, minibodies, nanobodies (e.g. monovalent nanobodies, bivalent nanobodies, etc.), small modular immunopharmaceuticals (SMIPs), and shark variable IgNAR domains, are also encompassed within the expression &#x201c;antigen-binding fragment,&#x201d; as used herein.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0132">An antigen-binding fragment of an antibody will typically comprise at least one variable domain. The variable domain may be of any size or amino acid composition and will generally comprise at least one CDR which is adjacent to or in frame with one or more framework sequences. In antigen-binding fragments having a V<sub>H </sub>domain associated with a V<sub>L </sub>domain, the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains may be situated relative to one another in any suitable arrangement. For example, the variable region may be dimeric and contain V<sub>H</sub>-V<sub>H</sub>, V<sub>H</sub>-V<sub>L </sub>or V<sub>L</sub>-V<sub>L </sub>dimers. Alternatively, the antigen-binding fragment of an antibody may contain a monomeric V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L </sub>domain.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0133">In certain embodiments, an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody may contain at least one variable domain covalently linked to at least one constant domain. Non-limiting, exemplary configurations of variable and constant domains that may be found within an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention include: (i) V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1; (ii) V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>2; (iii) V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>3; (iv) V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1-C<sub>H</sub>2; (v) V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1-C<sub>H</sub>2-C<sub>H</sub>3; (vi) V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>2-C<sub>H</sub>3; (vii) V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>L</sub>; (viii) V<sub>L</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1; (ix) V<sub>L</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>2; (x) V<sub>L</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>3; (xi) V<sub>L</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1-C<sub>H</sub>2; (xii) V<sub>L</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1-C<sub>H</sub>2-C<sub>H</sub>3; (xiii) V<sub>L</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>2-C<sub>H</sub>3; and (xiv) V<sub>L</sub>-C<sub>L</sub>. In any configuration of variable and constant domains, including any of the exemplary configurations listed above, the variable and constant domains may be either directly linked to one another or may be linked by a full or partial hinge or linker region. A hinge region may consist of at least 2 (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60 or more) amino acids which result in a flexible or semi-flexible linkage between adjacent variable and/or constant domains in a single polypeptide molecule. Moreover, an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention may comprise a homo-dimer or hetero-dimer (or other multimer) of any of the variable and constant domain configurations listed above in non-covalent association with one another and/or with one or more monomeric V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L </sub>domain (e.g., by disulfide bond(s)).</p><p id="p-0150" num="0134">As with full antibody molecules, antigen-binding fragments may be monospecific or multispecific (e.g., bispecific). A multispecific antigen-binding fragment of an antibody will typically comprise at least two different variable domains, wherein each variable domain is capable of specifically binding to a separate antigen or to a different epitope on the same antigen. Any multispecific antibody format, including the exemplary bispecific antibody formats disclosed herein, may be adapted for use in the context of an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention using routine techniques available in the art.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0135">The antibodies of the present invention may function through complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). &#x201c;Complement-dependent cytotoxicity&#x201d; (CDC) refers to lysis of antigen-expressing cells by an antibody of the invention in the presence of complement. &#x201c;Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity&#x201d; (ADCC) refers to a cell-mediated reaction in which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc receptors (FcRs) (e.g., Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a target cell and thereby lead to lysis of the target cell. CDC and ADCC can be measured using assays that are well known and available in the art. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,500,362 and 5,821,337, and Clynes et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 95:652-656). The constant region of an antibody is important in the ability of an antibody to fix complement and mediate cell-dependent cytotoxicity. Thus, the isotype of an antibody may be selected on the basis of whether it is desirable for the antibody to mediate cytotoxicity.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0136">In certain embodiments of the invention, the anti-MUC16 monospecific antibodies or anti-MUC16/anti-CD3 bispecific antibodies of the invention are human antibodies. The term &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3. However, the term &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0137">The antibodies of the invention may, in some embodiments, be recombinant human antibodies. The term &#x201c;recombinant human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is intended to include all human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector transfected into a host cell (described further below), antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library (described further below), antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes (see e.g., Taylor et al. (1992) Nucl. Acids Res. 20:6287-6295) or antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involves splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies are subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0138">Human antibodies can exist in two forms that are associated with hinge heterogeneity. In one form, an immunoglobulin molecule comprises a stable four chain construct of approximately 150-160 kDa in which the dimers are held together by an interchain heavy chain disulfide bond. In a second form, the dimers are not linked via inter-chain disulfide bonds and a molecule of about 75-80 kDa is formed composed of a covalently coupled light and heavy chain (half-antibody). These forms have been extremely difficult to separate, even after affinity purification.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0139">The frequency of appearance of the second form in various intact IgG isotypes is due to, but not limited to, structural differences associated with the hinge region isotype of the antibody. A single amino acid substitution in the hinge region of the human IgG4 hinge can significantly reduce the appearance of the second form (Angal et al. (1993) Molecular Immunology 30:105) to levels typically observed using a human IgG1 hinge. The instant invention encompasses antibodies having one or more mutations in the hinge, C<sub>H</sub>2 or C<sub>H</sub>3 region which may be desirable, for example, in production, to improve the yield of the desired antibody form.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0140">The antibodies of the invention may be isolated antibodies. An &#x201c;isolated antibody,&#x201d; as used herein, means an antibody that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from at least one component of its natural environment. For example, an antibody that has been separated or removed from at least one component of an organism, or from a tissue or cell in which the antibody naturally exists or is naturally produced, is an &#x201c;isolated antibody&#x201d; for purposes of the present invention. An isolated antibody also includes an antibody in situ within a recombinant cell. Isolated antibodies are antibodies that have been subjected to at least one purification or isolation step. According to certain embodiments, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0141">The present invention also includes one-arm antibodies that bind MUC16. As used herein, a &#x201c;one-arm antibody&#x201d; means an antigen-binding molecule comprising a single antibody heavy chain and a single antibody light chain. The one-arm antibodies of the present invention may comprise any of the HCVR/LCVR or CDR amino acid sequences as set forth in Table 1.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0142">The anti-MUC16 or anti-MUC16/anti-CD3 antibodies disclosed herein may comprise one or more amino acid substitutions, insertions and/or deletions in the framework and/or CDR regions of the heavy and light chain variable domains as compared to the corresponding germline sequences from which the antibodies were derived. Such mutations can be readily ascertained by comparing the amino acid sequences disclosed herein to germline sequences available from, for example, public antibody sequence databases. The present invention includes antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments thereof, which are derived from any of the amino acid sequences disclosed herein, wherein one or more amino acids within one or more framework and/or CDR regions are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of the germline sequence from which the antibody was derived, or to the corresponding residue(s) of another human germline sequence, or to a conservative amino acid substitution of the corresponding germline residue(s) (such sequence changes are referred to herein collectively as &#x201c;germline mutations&#x201d;). A person of ordinary skill in the art, starting with the heavy and light chain variable region sequences disclosed herein, can easily produce numerous antibodies and antigen-binding fragments which comprise one or more individual germline mutations or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, all of the framework and/or CDR residues within the V<sub>H </sub>and/or V<sub>L </sub>domains are mutated back to the residues found in the original germline sequence from which the antibody was derived. In other embodiments, only certain residues are mutated back to the original germline sequence, e.g., only the mutated residues found within the first 8 amino acids of FR1 or within the last 8 amino acids of FR4, or only the mutated residues found within CDR1, CDR2 or CDR3. In other embodiments, one or more of the framework and/or CDR residue(s) are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of a different germline sequence (i.e., a germline sequence that is different from the germline sequence from which the antibody was originally derived). Furthermore, the antibodies of the present invention may contain any combination of two or more germline mutations within the framework and/or CDR regions, e.g., wherein certain individual residues are mutated to the corresponding residue of a particular germline sequence while certain other residues that differ from the original germline sequence are maintained or are mutated to the corresponding residue of a different germline sequence. Once obtained, antibodies and antigen-binding fragments that contain one or more germline mutations can be easily tested for one or more desired property such as, improved binding specificity, increased binding (e.g., as measured by cell binding titration or FACS binding) or binding affinity (e.g., K<sub>D</sub>), improved or enhanced antagonistic or agonistic biological properties (as the case may be), reduced immunogenicity, etc. Antibodies and antigen-binding fragments obtained in this general manner are encompassed within the present invention.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0143">The present invention also includes anti-MUC16 or anti-MUC16/anti-CD3 antibodies comprising variants of any of the HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences disclosed herein having one or more conservative substitutions. For example, the present invention includes anti-MUC16 or anti-MUC16/anti-CD3 antibodies having HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences with, e.g., 10 or fewer, 8 or fewer, 6 or fewer, 4 or fewer, etc. conservative amino acid substitutions relative to any of the HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences set forth in Table 1 herein or as described in Tables 16, 18, 19, 22, and 23 herein.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0144">The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; refers to an antigenic determinant that interacts with a specific antigen binding site in the variable region of an antibody molecule known as a paratope. A single antigen may have more than one epitope. Thus, different antibodies may bind to different areas on an antigen and may have different biological effects. Epitopes may be either conformational or linear. A conformational epitope is produced by spatially juxtaposed amino acids from different segments of the linear polypeptide chain. A linear epitope is one produced by adjacent amino acid residues in a polypeptide chain. In certain circumstance, an epitope may include moieties of saccharides, phosphoryl groups, or sulfonyl groups on the antigen.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0145">The term &#x201c;substantial identity&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially identical,&#x201d; when referring to a nucleic acid or fragment thereof, indicates that, when optimally aligned with appropriate nucleotide insertions or deletions with another nucleic acid (or its complementary strand), there is nucleotide sequence identity in at least about 95%, and more preferably at least about 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the nucleotide bases, as measured by any well-known algorithm of sequence identity, such as FASTA, BLAST or Gap, as discussed below. A nucleic acid molecule having substantial identity to a reference nucleic acid molecule may, in certain instances, encode a polypeptide having the same or substantially similar amino acid sequence as the polypeptide encoded by the reference nucleic acid molecule.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0146">As applied to polypeptides, the term &#x201c;substantial similarity&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially similar&#x201d; means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 95% sequence identity, even more preferably at least 98% or 99% sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. A &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; is one in which an amino acid residue is substituted by another amino acid residue having a side chain (R group) with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity). In general, a conservative amino acid substitution will not substantially change the functional properties of a protein. In cases where two or more amino acid sequences differ from each other by conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity or degree of similarity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Means for making this adjustment are well-known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Pearson (1994) Methods Mol. Biol. 24: 307-331, herein incorporated by reference. Examples of groups of amino acids that have side chains with similar chemical properties include (1) aliphatic side chains: glycine, alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine; (2) aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains: serine and threonine; (3) amide-containing side chains: asparagine and glutamine; (4) aromatic side chains: phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; (5) basic side chains: lysine, arginine, and histidine; (6) acidic side chains: aspartate and glutamate, and (7) sulfur-containing side chains are cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamate-aspartate, and asparagine-glutamine. Alternatively, a conservative replacement is any change having a positive value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix disclosed in Gonnet et al. (1992) Science 256: 1443-1445, herein incorporated by reference. A &#x201c;moderately conservative&#x201d; replacement is any change having a nonnegative value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0147">Sequence similarity for polypeptides, which is also referred to as sequence identity, is typically measured using sequence analysis software. Protein analysis software matches similar sequences using measures of similarity assigned to various substitutions, deletions and other modifications, including conservative amino acid substitutions. For instance, GCG software contains programs such as Gap and Bestfit which can be used with default parameters to determine sequence homology or sequence identity between closely related polypeptides, such as homologous polypeptides from different species of organisms or between a wild type protein and a mutein thereof. See, e.g., GCG Version 6.1. Polypeptide sequences also can be compared using FASTA using default or recommended parameters, a program in GCG Version 6.1. FASTA (e.g., FASTA2 and FASTA3) provides alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences (Pearson (2000) supra). Another preferred algorithm when comparing a sequence of the invention to a database containing a large number of sequences from different organisms is the computer program BLAST, especially BLASTP or TBLASTN, using default parameters.

Once obtained, antibodies and antigen-binding fragments that contain one or more germline mutations can be tested for one or more desired properties such as, improved binding specificity, weak or reduced binding or binding affinity, improved or enhanced pharmacokinetic properties, reduced immunogenicity, etc. Antibodies and antigen-binding fragments obtained in this general manner given the guidance of the present disclosure are encompassed within the present invention.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0151">The present invention also includes anti-CD3 antibodies comprising variants of any of the HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences disclosed herein having one or more conservative substitutions. For example, the present invention includes anti-CD3 antibodies having HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences with, e.g., 10 or fewer, 8 or fewer, 6 or fewer, 4 or fewer, etc. conservative amino acid substitutions relative to any of the HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences set forth in Tables 16, 18, 19, 22, and 23 herein. The antibodies and bispecific antigen-binding molecules of the present invention comprise one or more amino acid substitutions, insertions and/or deletions in the framework and/or CDR regions of the heavy and light chain variable domains as compared to the corresponding germline sequences from which the individual antigen-binding domains were derived, while maintaining or improving the desired weak-to-no detectable binding to CD3 antigen. A &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; is one in which an amino acid residue is substituted by another amino acid residue having a side chain (R group) with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity). In general, a conservative amino acid substitution will not substantially change the functional properties of a protein, i.e. the amino acid substitution maintains or improves the desired weak to no detectable binding or binding affinity in the case of anti-CD3 binding molecules. Examples of groups of amino acids that have side chains with similar chemical properties include (1) aliphatic side chains: glycine, alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine; (2) aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains: serine and threonine; (3) amide-containing side chains: asparagine and glutamine; (4) aromatic side chains: phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; (5) basic side chains: lysine, arginine, and histidine; (6) acidic side chains: aspartate and glutamate, and (7) sulfur-containing side chains are cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamate-aspartate, and asparagine-glutamine. Alternatively, a conservative replacement is any change having a positive value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix disclosed in Gonnet et al. (1992) Science 256: 1443-1445. A &#x201c;moderately conservative&#x201d; replacement is any change having a nonnegative value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0152">The present invention also includes antigen-binding molecules comprising an antigen-binding domain with an HCVR and/or CDR amino acid sequence that is substantially identical to any of the HCVR and/or CDR amino acid sequences disclosed herein, while maintaining or improving the desired weak affinity to CD3 antigen. The term &#x201c;substantial identity&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially identical,&#x201d; when referring to an amino acid sequence means that two amino acid sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 95% sequence identity, even more preferably at least 98% or 99% sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. In cases where two or more amino acid sequences differ from each other by conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity or degree of similarity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Means for making this adjustment are well-known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Pearson (1994) Methods Mol. Biol. 24: 307-331.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0153">Sequence similarity for polypeptides, which is also referred to as sequence identity, is typically measured using sequence analysis software. Protein analysis software matches similar sequences using measures of similarity assigned to various substitutions, deletions and other modifications, including conservative amino acid substitutions. For instance, GCG software contains programs such as Gap and Bestfit which can be used with default parameters to determine sequence homology or sequence identity between closely related polypeptides, such as homologous polypeptides from different species of organisms or between a wild type protein and a mutein thereof. See, e.g., GCG Version 6.1. Polypeptide sequences also can be compared using FASTA using default or recommended parameters, a program in GCG Version 6.1. FASTA (e.g., FASTA2 and FASTA3) provides alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences (Pearson (2000) supra). Another preferred algorithm when comparing a sequence of the invention to a database containing a large number of sequences from different organisms is the computer program BLAST, especially BLASTP or TBLASTN, using default parameters.

Such mutations can be readily ascertained by comparing the amino acid sequences disclosed herein to germline sequences available from, for example, public antibody sequence databases. The antigen-binding molecules of the present invention may comprise antigen-binding domains which are derived from any of the exemplary amino acid sequences disclosed herein, wherein one or more amino acids within one or more framework and/or CDR regions are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of the germline sequence from which the antibody was derived, or to the corresponding residue(s) of another human germline sequence, or to a conservative amino acid substitution of the corresponding germline residue(s) (such sequence changes are referred to herein collectively as &#x201c;germline mutations&#x201d;). A person of ordinary skill in the art, starting with the heavy and light chain variable region sequences disclosed herein, can easily produce numerous antibodies and antigen-binding fragments which comprise one or more individual germline mutations or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, all of the framework and/or CDR residues within the V<sub>H </sub>and/or V<sub>L </sub>domains are mutated back to the residues found in the original germline sequence from which the antigen-binding domain was originally derived. In other embodiments, only certain residues are mutated back to the original germline sequence, e.g., only the mutated residues found within the first 8 amino acids of FR1 or within the last 8 amino acids of FR4, or only the mutated residues found within CDR1, CDR2 or CDR3. In other embodiments, one or more of the framework and/or CDR residue(s) are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of a different germline sequence (i.e., a germline sequence that is different from the germline sequence from which the antigen-binding domain was originally derived). Furthermore, the antigen-binding domains may contain any combination of two or more germline mutations within the framework and/or CDR regions, e.g., wherein certain individual residues are mutated to the corresponding residue of a particular germline sequence while certain other residues that differ from the original germline sequence are maintained or are mutated to the corresponding residue of a different germline sequence. Once obtained, antigen-binding domains that contain one or more germline mutations can be easily tested for one or more desired property such as, improved binding specificity, increased binding or binding affinity, improved or enhanced antagonistic or agonistic biological properties (as the case may be), reduced immunogenicity, etc. Bispecific antigen-binding molecules comprising one or more antigen-binding domains obtained in this general manner are encompassed within the present invention.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0185">The present invention also includes antigen-binding molecules wherein one or both antigen-binding domains comprise variants of any of the HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences disclosed herein having one or more conservative substitutions. For example, the present invention includes antigen-binding molecules comprising an antigen-binding domain having HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences with, e.g., 10 or fewer, 8 or fewer, 6 or fewer, 4 or fewer, etc. conservative amino acid substitutions relative to any of the HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences disclosed herein. A &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; is one in which an amino acid residue is substituted by another amino acid residue having a side chain (R group) with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity). In general, a conservative amino acid substitution will not substantially change the functional properties of a protein. Examples of groups of amino acids that have side chains with similar chemical properties include (1) aliphatic side chains: glycine, alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine; (2) aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains: serine and threonine; (3) amide-containing side chains: asparagine and glutamine; (4) aromatic side chains: phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; (5) basic side chains: lysine, arginine, and histidine; (6) acidic side chains: aspartate and glutamate, and (7) sulfur-containing side chains are cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamate-aspartate, and asparagine-glutamine. Alternatively, a conservative replacement is any change having a positive value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix disclosed in Gonnet et al. (1992) Science 256: 1443-1445, herein incorporated by reference. A &#x201c;moderately conservative&#x201d; replacement is any change having a nonnegative value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0186">The present invention also includes antigen-binding molecules comprising an antigen-binding domain with an HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequence that is substantially identical to any of the HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences disclosed herein. The term &#x201c;substantial identity&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially identical,&#x201d; when referring to an amino acid sequence means that two amino acid sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 95% sequence identity, even more preferably at least 98% or 99% sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. In cases where two or more amino acid sequences differ from each other by conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity or degree of similarity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Means for making this adjustment are well-known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Pearson (1994) Methods Mol. Biol. 24: 307-331, herein incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0187">Sequence similarity for polypeptides, which is also referred to as sequence identity, is typically measured using sequence analysis software. Protein analysis software matches similar sequences using measures of similarity assigned to various substitutions, deletions and other modifications, including conservative amino acid substitutions. For instance, GCG software contains programs such as Gap and Bestfit which can be used with default parameters to determine sequence homology or sequence identity between closely related polypeptides, such as homologous polypeptides from different species of organisms or between a wild type protein and a mutein thereof. See, e.g., GCG Version 6.1. Polypeptide sequences also can be compared using FASTA using default or recommended parameters, a program in GCG Version 6.1. FASTA (e.g., FASTA2 and FASTA3) provides alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences (Pearson (2000) supra). Another preferred algorithm when comparing a sequence of the invention to a database containing a large number of sequences from different organisms is the computer program BLAST, especially BLASTP or TBLASTN, using default parameters.

Alternatively, anti-MUC16 antibodies of the invention may exhibit enhanced binding to MUC16 at acidic pH as compared to neutral pH.

For example, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may be regarded as exhibiting &#x201c;reduced binding to MUC16 at acidic pH as compared to neutral pH&#x201d; for purposes of the present invention if the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof exhibits an acidic/neutral K<sub>D </sub>ratio of about 3.0 or greater.

For example, by substituting one or more amino acids of an antigen-binding domain (e.g., within a CDR) with a histidine residue, an antibody with reduced antigen-binding at acidic pH relative to neutral pH may be obtained.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Antibodies Comprising Fc Variants</heading><p id="p-0208" num="0191">According to certain embodiments of the present invention, anti-MUC16 antibodies, and anti-CD3/anti-MUC16 bispecific antigen-binding molecules, are provided comprising an Fc domain comprising one or more mutations which enhance or diminish antibody binding to the FcRn receptor, e.g., at acidic pH as compared to neutral pH. For example, the present invention includes antibodies comprising a mutation in the C<sub>H</sub>2 or a C<sub>H</sub>3 region of the Fc domain, wherein the mutation(s) increases the affinity of the Fc domain to FcRn in an acidic environment (e.g., in an endosome where pH ranges from about 5.5 to about 6.0).

In addition, methods such as epitope excision, epitope extraction and chemical modification of antigens can be employed (Tomer, 2000, Protein Science 9:487-496). Another method that can be used to identify the amino acids within a polypeptide with which an antigen-binding domain of an antibody interacts is hydrogen/deuterium exchange detected by mass spectrometry. In general terms, the hydrogen/deuterium exchange method involves deuterium-labeling the protein of interest, followed by binding the antibody to the deuterium-labeled protein. Next, the protein/antibody complex is transferred to water to allow hydrogen-deuterium exchange to occur at all residues except for the residues protected by the antibody (which remain deuterium-labeled). After dissociation of the antibody, the target protein is subjected to protease cleavage and mass spectrometry analysis, thereby revealing the deuterium-labeled residues which correspond to the specific amino acids with which the antibody interacts.

If the test antibody is able to bind to MUC16 (or CD3) following saturation binding with the reference bispecific antigen-binding molecule, it can be concluded that the test antibody binds to a different epitope of MUC16 (or CD3) than the reference bispecific antigen-binding molecule. On the other hand, if the test antibody is not able to bind to the MUC16 (or CD3) molecule following saturation binding with the reference bispecific antigen-binding molecule, then the test antibody may bind to the same epitope of MUC16 (or CD3) as the epitope bound by the reference bispecific antigen-binding molecule of the invention. Additional routine experimentation (e.g., peptide mutation and binding analyses) can then be carried out to confirm whether the observed lack of binding of the test antibody is in fact due to binding to the same epitope as the reference bispecific antigen-binding molecule or if steric blocking (or another phenomenon) is responsible for the lack of observed binding. Experiments of this sort can be performed using ELISA, RIA, Biacore, flow cytometry or any other quantitative or qualitative antibody-binding assay available in the art. In accordance with certain embodiments of the present invention, two antigen-binding proteins bind to the same (or overlapping) epitope if, e.g., a 1-, 5-, 10-, 20- or 100-fold excess of one antigen-binding protein inhibits binding of the other by at least 50% but preferably 75%, 90% or even 99% as measured in a competitive binding assay (see, e.g., Junghans et al., Cancer Res. 1990:50:1495-1502). Alternatively, two antigen-binding proteins are deemed to bind to the same epitope if essentially all amino acid mutations in the antigen that reduce or eliminate binding of one antigen-binding protein reduce or eliminate binding of the other. Two antigen-binding proteins are deemed to have &#x201c;overlapping epitopes&#x201d; if only a subset of the amino acid mutations that reduce or eliminate binding of one antigen-binding protein reduce or eliminate binding of the other.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0213">To determine if an antibody or antigen-binding domain thereof competes for binding with a reference antigen-binding molecule, the above-described binding methodology is performed in two orientations: In a first orientation, the reference antigen-binding molecule is allowed to bind to a MUC16 protein (or CD3 protein) under saturating conditions followed by assessment of binding of the test antibody to the MUC16 (or CD3) molecule. In a second orientation, the test antibody is allowed to bind to a MUC16 (or CD3) molecule under saturating conditions followed by assessment of binding of the reference antigen-binding molecule to the MUC16 (or CD3) molecule. If, in both orientations, only the first (saturating) antigen-binding molecule is capable of binding to the MUC16 (or CD3) molecule, then it is concluded that the test antibody and the reference antigen-binding molecule compete for binding to MUC16 (or CD3). As will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, an antibody that competes for binding with a reference antigen-binding molecule may not necessarily bind to the same epitope as the reference antibody, but may sterically block binding of the reference antibody by binding an overlapping or adjacent epitope.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Preparation of Antigen-Binding Domains and Construction of Bispecific Molecules</heading><p id="p-0231" num="0214">Antigen-binding domains specific for particular antigens can be prepared by any antibody generating technology known in the art. Once obtained, two different antigen-binding domains, specific for two different antigens (e.g., CD3 and MUC16), can be appropriately arranged relative to one another to produce a bispecific antigen-binding molecule of the present invention using routine methods. (A discussion of exemplary bispecific antibody formats that can be used to construct the bispecific antigen-binding molecules of the present invention is provided elsewhere herein). In certain embodiments, one or more of the individual components (e.g., heavy and light chains) of the multispecific antigen-binding molecules of the invention are derived from chimeric, humanized or fully human antibodies. Methods for making such antibodies are well known in the art. For example, one or more of the heavy and/or light chains of the bispecific antigen-binding molecules of the present invention can be prepared using VELOCIMMUNE&#x2122; technology. Using VELOCIMMUNE&#x2122; technology (or any other human antibody generating technology), high affinity chimeric antibodies to a particular antigen (e.g., CD3 or MUC16) are initially isolated having a human variable region and a mouse constant region. The antibodies are characterized and selected for desirable characteristics, including affinity, selectivity, epitope, etc. The mouse constant regions are replaced with a desired human constant region to generate fully human heavy and/or light chains that can be incorporated into the bispecific antigen-binding molecules of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0215">Genetically engineered animals may be used to make human bispecific antigen-binding molecules. For example, a genetically modified mouse can be used which is incapable of rearranging and expressing an endogenous mouse immunoglobulin light chain variable sequence, wherein the mouse expresses only one or two human light chain variable domains encoded by human immunoglobulin sequences operably linked to the mouse kappa constant gene at the endogenous mouse kappa locus. Such genetically modified mice can be used to produce fully human bispecific antigen-binding molecules comprising two different heavy chains that associate with an identical light chain that comprises a variable domain derived from one of two different human light chain variable region gene segments. (See, e.g., US 2011/0195454). Fully human refers to an antibody, or antigen-binding fragment or immunoglobulin domain thereof, comprising an amino acid sequence encoded by a DNA derived from a human sequence over the entire length of each polypeptide of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment or immunoglobulin domain thereof. In some instances, the fully human sequence is derived from a protein endogenous to a human. In other instances, the fully human protein or protein sequence comprises a chimeric sequence wherein each component sequence is derived from human sequence. While not being bound by any one theory, chimeric proteins or chimeric sequences are generally designed to minimize the creation of immunogenic epitopes in the junctions of component sequences, e.g. compared to any wild-type human immunoglobulin regions or domains.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Bioequivalents</heading><p id="p-0233" num="0216">The present invention encompasses antigen-binding molecules having amino acid sequences that vary from those of the exemplary molecules disclosed herein but that retain the ability to bind CD3 and/or MUC16.

Two antigen-binding proteins, or antibodies, are considered bioequivalent if, for example, they are pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives whose rate and extent of absorption do not show a significant difference when administered at the same molar dose under similar experimental conditions, either single does or multiple dose. Some antigen-binding proteins will be considered equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives if they are equivalent in the extent of their absorption but not in their rate of absorption and yet may be considered bioequivalent because such differences in the rate of absorption are intentional and are reflected in the labeling, are not essential to the attainment of effective body drug concentrations on, e.g., chronic use, and are considered medically insignificant for the particular drug product studied.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0218">In one embodiment, two antigen-binding proteins are bioequivalent if there are no clinically meaningful differences in their safety, purity, and potency.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0219">In one embodiment, two antigen-binding proteins are bioequivalent if a patient can be switched one or more times between the reference product and the biological product without an expected increase in the risk of adverse effects, including a clinically significant change in immunogenicity, or diminished effectiveness, as compared to continued therapy without such switching.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0220">In one embodiment, two antigen-binding proteins are bioequivalent if they both act by a common mechanism or mechanisms of action for the condition or conditions of use, to the extent that such mechanisms are known.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0221">Bioequivalence may be demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro methods. Bioequivalence measures include, e.g., (a) an in vivo test in humans or other mammals, in which the concentration of the antibody or its metabolites is measured in blood, plasma, serum, or other biological fluid as a function of time; (b) an in vitro test that has been correlated with and is reasonably predictive of human in vivo bioavailability data; (c) an in vivo test in humans or other mammals in which the appropriate acute pharmacological effect of the antibody (or its target) is measured as a function of time; and (d) in a well-controlled clinical trial that establishes safety, efficacy, or bioavailability or bioequivalence of an antigen-binding protein.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0222">Bioequivalent variants of the exemplary bispecific antigen-binding molecules set forth herein may be constructed by, for example, making various substitutions of residues or sequences or deleting terminal or internal residues or sequences not needed for biological activity. For example, cysteine residues not essential for biological activity can be deleted or replaced with other amino acids to prevent formation of unnecessary or incorrect intramolecular disulfide bridges upon renaturation. In other contexts, bioequivalent antigen-binding proteins may include variants of the exemplary bispecific antigen-binding molecules set forth herein comprising amino acid changes which modify the glycosylation characteristics of the molecules, e.g., mutations which eliminate or remove glycosylation.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Species Selectivity and Species Cross-Reactivity</heading><p id="p-0240" num="0223">According to certain embodiments of the invention, antigen-binding molecules are provided which bind to human CD3 but not to CD3 from other species.

Exemplary embodiments of specific linkers are discussed above. More generally, and as used herein, the term &#x201c;linker&#x201d; refers to any divalent group or moiety that links, connects, or bonds a binding agent (e.g., an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof) with a payload compound set forth herein. Generally, suitable binding agent linkers for the antibody conjugates described herein are those that are sufficiently stable to exploit the circulating half-life of the antibody and, at the same time, capable of releasing its payload after antigen-mediated internalization of the conjugate. Linkers can be cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers are linkers that are cleaved by intracellular metabolism following internalization, e.g., cleavage via hydrolysis, reduction, or enzymatic reaction. Non-cleavable linkers are linkers that release an attached payload via lysosomal degradation of the antibody following internalization. Suitable linkers include, but are not limited to, acid-labile linkers, hydrolysis-labile linkers, enzymatically cleavable linkers, reduction labile linkers, self-immolative linkers, and non-cleavable linkers. Suitable linkers also include, but are not limited to, those that are or comprise peptides, glucuronides, succinimide-thioethers, polyethylene glycol (PEG) units, hydrazones, mal-caproyl units, dipeptide units, valine-citrulline units, and para-aminobenzyl (PAB) units. In some cases, the linker is capable of bonding to the antibody or antigen-binding fragment through a lysine residue or a cysteine residue (e.g., via cleavage of a disulfide group of the antibody or fragment, or via a cysteine residue engineered into the antibody or fragment). In some cases, the linker is capable of bonding to the antibody or fragment through a glutamine residue, including those derived via transglutaminase-mediated conjugation.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0293">Exemplary linkers that can be used in the context of the present invention include linkers that comprise or consist of e.g., MC (6-maleimidocaproyl), MCC (maleimidomethyl cyclohexane-1-carboxylate), MP (maleimidopropanoyl), val-cit (valine-citrulline), val-ala (valine-alanine), ala-phe (alanine-phenylalanine), phe-lys (phenylalanine-lysine), dipeptide site in protease-cleavable linker, PAB (p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl), SPP (N-Succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate), SMCC (N-Succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 carboxylate), SIAB (N-Succinimidyl (4-iodo-acetyl)aminobenzoate), and variants and combinations thereof.

The preferred dose is typically calculated according to body weight or body surface area. When a bispecific antigen-binding molecule of the present invention is used for therapeutic purposes in an adult patient, it may be advantageous to intravenously administer the bispecific antigen-binding molecule of the present invention normally at a single dose of about 0.01 to about 20 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.02 to about 7, about 0.03 to about 5, or about 0.05 to about 3 mg/kg body weight. Depending on the severity of the condition, the frequency and the duration of the treatment can be adjusted. Effective dosages and schedules for administering a bispecific antigen-binding molecule may be determined empirically; for example, patient progress can be monitored by periodic assessment, and the dose adjusted accordingly. Moreover, interspecies scaling of dosages can be performed using well-known methods in the art (e.g., Mordenti et al., 1991<i>, Pharmaceut. Res. </i>8:1351).</p><p id="p-0323" num="0298">Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the mutant viruses, receptor mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu et al., 1987, J.

Administration can be systemic or local.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0299">A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be delivered subcutaneously or intravenously with a standard needle and syringe. In addition, with respect to subcutaneous delivery, a pen delivery device readily has applications in delivering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Such a pen delivery device can be reusable or disposable. A reusable pen delivery device generally utilizes a replaceable cartridge that contains a pharmaceutical composition. Once all of the pharmaceutical composition within the cartridge has been administered and the cartridge is empty, the empty cartridge can readily be discarded and replaced with a new cartridge that contains the pharmaceutical composition. The pen delivery device can then be reused. In a disposable pen delivery device, there is no replaceable cartridge. Rather, the disposable pen delivery device comes prefilled with the pharmaceutical composition held in a reservoir within the device. Once the reservoir is emptied of the pharmaceutical composition, the entire device is discarded.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0300">Numerous reusable pen and autoinjector delivery devices have applications in the subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.

In certain embodiments, however, the amount of an antigen-binding molecule contained in the initial, secondary and/or tertiary doses varies from one another (e.g., adjusted up or down as appropriate) during the course of treatment. In certain embodiments, two or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5) doses are administered at the beginning of the treatment regimen as &#x201c;loading doses&#x201d; followed by subsequent doses that are administered on a less frequent basis (e.g., &#x201c;maintenance doses&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0340" num="0315">In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, each secondary and/or tertiary dose is administered 1 to 26 (e.g., 1, 1&#xbd;, 2, 2&#xbd;, 3, 3&#xbd;, 4, 4&#xbd;, 5, 5&#xbd;, 6, 6&#xbd;, 7, 7&#xbd;, 8, 8&#xbd;, 9, 9&#xbd;, 10, 10&#xbd;, 11, 11&#xbd;, 12, 12&#xbd;, 13, 13&#xbd;, 14, 14&#xbd;, 15, 15&#xbd;, 16, 16&#xbd;, 17, 17&#xbd;, 18, 18&#xbd;, 19, 19&#xbd;, 20, 20&#xbd;, 21, 21&#xbd;, 22, 22&#xbd;, 23, 23&#xbd;, 24, 24&#xbd;, 25, 25&#xbd;, 26, 26&#xbd;, or more) weeks after the immediately preceding dose. The phrase &#x201c;the immediately preceding dose,&#x201d; as used herein, means, in a sequence of multiple administrations, the dose of antigen-binding molecule which is administered to a patient prior to the administration of the very next dose in the sequence with no intervening doses.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0316">The methods according to this aspect of the invention may comprise administering to a patient any number of secondary and/or tertiary doses of an antigen-binding molecule (e.g., an anti-MUC16 antibody or a bispecific antigen-binding molecule that specifically binds MUC16 and CD3). For example, in certain embodiments, only a single secondary dose is administered to the patient. In other embodiments, two or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more) secondary doses are administered to the patient. Likewise, in certain embodiments, only a single tertiary dose is administered to the patient. In other embodiments, two or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more) tertiary doses are administered to the patient.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0317">In embodiments involving multiple secondary doses, each secondary dose may be administered at the same frequency as the other secondary doses. For example, each secondary dose may be administered to the patient 1 to 2 weeks after the immediately preceding dose. Similarly, in embodiments involving multiple tertiary doses, each tertiary dose may be administered at the same frequency as the other tertiary doses. For example, each tertiary dose may be administered to the patient 2 to 4 weeks after the immediately preceding dose. Alternatively, the frequency at which the secondary and/or tertiary doses are administered to a patient can vary over the course of the treatment regimen. The frequency of administration may also be adjusted during the course of treatment by a physician depending on the needs of the individual patient following clinical examination.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">Diagnostic Uses of the Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0343" num="0318">The anti-MUC16 antibodies of the present invention may also be used to detect and/or measure MUC16, or MUC16-expressing cells in a sample, e.g., a biological sample for diagnostic purposes. For example, an anti-MUC16 antibody, or fragment thereof, may be used to diagnose a condition or disease characterized by aberrant expression (e.g., over-expression, under-expression, lack of expression, etc.) of MUC16. Exemplary diagnostic assays for MUC16 may comprise, e.g., contacting a sample, obtained from a patient, with an anti-MUC16 antibody of the invention, wherein the anti-MUC16 antibody is labeled with a detectable label or reporter molecule. Alternatively, an unlabeled anti-MUC16 antibody can be used in diagnostic applications in combination with a secondary antibody which is itself detectably labeled. The detectable label or reporter molecule can be a radioisotope, such as <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>14</sup>C <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, or <sup>125</sup>I; a fluorescent or chemiluminescent moiety such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, or rhodamine; or an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, horseradish peroxidase, or luciferase. Another exemplary diagnostic use of the anti-MUC16 antibodies of the invention includes <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled, such as <sup>89</sup>Zr-desferrioxamine-labeled, antibody for the purpose of noninvasive identification and tracking of tumor cells in a subject (e.g. positron emission tomography (PET) imaging). (See, e.g., Tavare, R. et al. Cancer Res. 2016 Jan. 1; 76(1):73-82; and Azad, B B. et al. Oncotarget. 2016 Mar. 15; 7(11):12344-58.) Specific exemplary assays that can be used to detect or measure MUC16 in a sample include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).</p><p id="p-0344" num="0319">Samples that can be used in MUC16 diagnostic assays according to the present invention include any tissue or fluid sample obtainable from a patient which contains detectable quantities of MUC16 protein, or fragments thereof, under normal or pathological conditions. Generally, levels of MUC16 in a particular sample obtained from a healthy patient (e.g., a patient not afflicted with a disease or condition associated with abnormal MUC16 levels or activity) will be measured to initially establish a baseline, or standard, level of MUC16. This baseline level of MUC16 can then be compared against the levels of MUC16 measured in samples obtained from individuals suspected of having a MUC16 related disease (e.g., a tumor containing MUC16-expressing cells) or condition. Examples of tissue or fluid samples include, but are not limited to plasma, serum, ascites, ovary, uterus, cervix, liver, bladder, pancreas, stomach, small or large intestine, gall bladder, breast, lung, kidney, salivary, and lacrimal glands, or any epithelioid malignancy thereof. Additional examples of tissue or fluid samples include, but are not limited to papillary serous carcinoma of the cervix, adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, clear cell adenocarcinoma of the bladder, seminal vesicle carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma and epithelioid mesothelioma. It is envisioned that any fluid or tissue sample which contains detectable quantities of MUC16 protein, or fragments thereof, may be subjected to the detection methods described herein. The described methods may be used to monitor the development and progression of malignant diseases, or to distinguish between normal and disease conditions. As such, the described methods may be used to detect or monitor cancers, such as ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma-mass forming type, adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix, and adenocarcinoma of the gastric tract.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0345" num="0320">The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the methods and compositions of the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers used (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.) but some experimental errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, molecular weight is average molecular weight, temperature is in degrees Centigrade, and pressure is at or near atmospheric.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">Example 1: Generation of Anti-MUC16 Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0346" num="0321">Anti-MUC16 antibodies were obtained by immunizing a genetically modified mouse with a human MUC16 antigen or by immunizing an engineered mouse comprising DNA encoding human immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain variable regions with a human MUC16 antigen.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0322">Genetically modified mice were immunized with hMUC16.nub (a truncated format encompassing the last five SEA domains of Mucin-16 (SEQ ID: 1902)), or immunized with an hMUC16-expressing cell line, such as OVCAR-3 cells. SEQ ID NO: 1902 contains residues 13810-14451 of SEQ ID NO: 1899, as well as C-terminal tags. Following immunization, splenocytes were harvested from each mouse and either (1) fused with mouse myeloma cells to preserve their viability and form hybridoma cells and screened for MUC16 specificity, or (2) B-cell sorted (as described in US 2007/0280945A1) using a human MUC16 fragment as the sorting reagent that binds and identifies reactive antibodies (antigen-positive B cells).</p><p id="p-0348" num="0323">Chimeric antibodies to MUC16 were initially isolated having a human variable region and a mouse constant region. The antibodies were characterized and selected for desirable characteristics, including affinity, selectivity, etc. If necessary, mouse constant regions were replaced with a desired human constant region, for example wild-type or modified IgG1 or IgG4 constant region, to generate a fully human anti-MUC16 antibody. While the constant region selected may vary according to specific use, high affinity antigen-binding and target specificity characteristics reside in the variable region. The antibody name designations such as H1H8755P and H1M7129N denote fully human antibodies &#x201c;H1H&#x201d; or chimeric human variable/mouse constant region antibodies &#x201c;H1M&#x201d;. Antibodies identified by the hybridoma method are indicated with antibody ID numbers ending with &#x201c;N&#x201d; or &#x201c;N2.&#x201d; Antibodies identified by the B-cell sorting method are indicated with antibody ID numbers ending with &#x201c;P&#x201d; or &#x201c;P2&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0324">Certain biological properties of the exemplary anti-MUC16 antibodies generated in accordance with the methods of this Example are described in detail in the Examples set forth below.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="2">Heavy and Light Chain Variable Region Amino Acid and Nucleic Acid Sequences of Anti-MUC16 Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0350" num="0325">Table 1 sets forth the amino acid sequence identifiers of the heavy and light chain variable regions and CDRs of selected anti-MUC16 antibodies of the invention.

Expressed hMUC16 on OVCAR-3 Cell Line</heading><p id="p-0353" num="0326">The ability of anti-MUC16 antibodies to bind specifically to endogenously expressing MUC16 on the human ovarian carcinoma cell line (OVCAR-3) was evaluated via an electrochemiluminescence based detection assay (Meso Scale Discovery (MSD), Rockville, Md.). Briefly, OVCAR-3 and a control ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line, SK-OV-3, which has no detectable hMUC16 expression, were rinsed in 1&#xd7;PBS supplemented with Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, Calif.) followed by incubation in Enzyme Free Cell Dissociation buffer (Millipore, Billerica, Mass.) for 10 min at 37&#xb0; C. Detached cells were then washed once in IxPBS supplemented with Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> and counted (Cellometer Auto T4 cell counter, Nexcelom Bioscience, Lawrence, Mass.). Approximately 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>cells were plated in MULTI-ARRAY 96-well carbon electrode plates (MSD) and incubated for 1 h at 37&#xb0; C. Nonspecific binding sites were then blocked by 2% BSA (w/v) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Next, serial dilutions of anti-MUC16 or control antibodies (0.85 &#x3bc;M-50 nM) and no-antibody buffer controls were added to the plate-bound cells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Plates were then washed to remove the unbound antibodies using an AquaMax2000 plate washer (MDS Analytical Technologies, Sunnyvale, Calif.). Plate-bound antibodies were detected with a SULFO-TAG&#x2122;-conjugated anti-human kappa light chain antibody (Regeneron) or a SULFO-TAG&#x2122;-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, Pa.) for 1h at RT. Post-wash, plates were developed with Read Buffer (MSD) according to manufacturer's protocol and luminescent signals were recorded with a SECTOR Imager 6000 (MSD) instrument.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0327">Luminescence intensity, measured in relative light units (RLU), for the two cell lines was recorded to indicate the binding intensity of each antibody. The ratio of signal detected with 1.9 nM or 16.7 nM anti-MUC16 antibody binding to OVCAR-3 vs. SK-OV-3 was reported as an indication of specificity and potency of binding (Table 3).</p><p id="p-0355"

specifically to OVCAR-3 at both high (16.7 nM) and low (1.9 nM) antibody concentrations. mlgG1, mlgG2a and hlgG1 Isotype Control antibodies showed no specific binding to either OVCAR-3 or the SK-OV-3 cell line. Additionally, evidence exists that the method is sensitive since several antibodies that did not exhibit binding to soluble monomeric human MUC16 protein in a surface plasmon resonance binding assay (see Example 4 hereinbelow) displayed specific binding to endogenous human MUC16 expressed on OVCAR-3 cells in this cell-based binding assay.</p><heading id="h-0028" level="1">Example 3: Generation of Bispecific Antibodies that Bind Ovarian Cell-Specific (MUC16) and CD3</heading><p id="p-0357" num="0329">The present invention provides bispecific antigen-binding molecules that bind CD3 and MUC16; such bispecific antigen-binding molecules are also referred to herein as &#x201c;anti-MUC16/anti-CD3 or anti-MUC16&#xd7;CD3 bispecific molecules.&#x201d; The anti-MUC16 portion of the anti-MUC16/anti-CD3 bispecific molecule is useful for targeting tumor cells that express MUC16 (also known as CA-125), and the anti-CD3 portion of the bispecific molecule is useful for activating T-cells.

The anti-MUC16 antibodies tested in this example were bivalent monospecific binders to MUC16 (expressed with a hlgG1 (H1H), mlgG1 (H1M), mlgG2 (H2M) or mlgG3 (H3M) constant region) or bispecific antibodies comprised of an anti-MUC16 binding domain and an anti-CD3 binding domain. Antibodies were captured onto a CM4 or CM5 Biacore sensor surface (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) derivatized via amine coupling with a monoclonal anti-human Fc antibody (GE, # BR-1008-39) or a monoclonal goat anti-mouse Fc antibody (GE, # BR-1008-38). Various concentrations of soluble monomeric human MUC16, in a truncated format encompassing the last five SEA domains of Mucin-16 (hMUC16.mmh, or MUC16 &#x201c;nub&#x201d;, SEQ ID: 1902) were injected over the anti-MUC16-antibody captured surface at a flow rate of 50 uL/minute (Biacore T-200) or 30 uL/minute (Biacore 4000). Antibody-reagent association was monitored for 4 min and the dissociation was monitored for 6-10 min.

Cohorts contained 4-5 mice per tested antibody and per mouse strain. All mice received a single intra-peritoneal (i.p.) 0.4 mg/kg dose. Blood samples were collected at 3 and 6 hours, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days post dosing. Blood was processed into serum and frozen at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. until analyzed.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0359">Circulating antibody concentrations were determined by total human IgG antibody analysis using the GyroLab xPlore&#x2122; (Gyros, Uppsala, Sweden). Briefly, a biotinylated goat anti-human IgG polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.) was captured onto streptavidin coated beads on a Gyrolab Bioaffy 200 CD (Gyros) in order to capture the human IgG present in the sera. After affinity column capture, bound human IgG antibody in samples was detected with Alexa-647 labeled goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Fluorescent signal on the column allowed for the detection of bound IgG and response units (RU) were read by the instrument. Sample concentrations were determined by interpolation from a standard curve that was fit using a 5-parameter logistic curve fit using the Gyrolab Evaluator Software. PK parameters were determined by non-compartmental analysis (NCA) using Phoenix&#xae;WinNonlin&#xae; software Version 6.3 (Certara, L. P., Princeton, N.J.) and an extravascular dosing model. Using the respective mean concentration values for each antibody, all PK parameters including observed maximum concentration in serum (C<sub>max</sub>), estimated half-life observed (t&#xbd;), and area under the concentration curve versus time up to the last measureable concentration (AUC<sub>last</sub>) were determined using a linear trapezoidal rule with linear interpolation and uniform weighting</p><p id="p-0401" num="0360">Following i.p. administration of antibodies in WT mice, the total IgG concentration-time profiles of BSMUC16/CD3-001, BSMUC16/CD3-005 and the isotype control were all similar, characterized first by a brief drug distribution followed by a single drug elimination phase throughout the remainder of the study. Maximum serum concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) and calculated drug exposure (AUC<sub>last</sub>) of the three antibodies were comparable (within 1.3-fold of each other).</p><p id="p-0402" num="0361">Following i.p. administration of antibodies in CD3<sup>hu/hu </sup>mice, BSMUC16/CD3-001, BSMUC16/CD3-005 and isotype control had comparable C<sub>max </sub>concentrations (4.6, 3.6 and 4.1 &#x3bc;g/mL, respectively). BSMUC16/CD3-005 and the isotype control exhibited similar drug elimination curves, while BSMUC16/CD3-001 exhibited steeper drug elimination than both, suggesting that human CD3 target binding drives clearance. Terminal antibody concentration for BSMUC16/CD3-001 was 0.03 &#x3bc;g/mL, which is about 28-fold less than terminal antibody concentrations determined for the isotype control (0.85 &#x3bc;g/mL) and 22-fold less than BSMUC16/CD3-005 (0.66 &#x3bc;g/mL) serum concentrations.</p><p id="p-0403" num="0362">In MUC16<sup>hu/hu</sup>&#xd7;CD3<sup>hu/hu </sup>double-humanized mice, the Muc16&#xd7;CD3 bispecific and isotype control antibodies had comparable C<sub>max </sub>concentrations (C<sub>max </sub>range: 4.5-6.9 &#x3bc;g/mL). Both bispecific antibodies exhibited steeper drug elimination than the isotype control suggesting a target-mediated effect. Terminal antibody concentrations for BSMUC16/CD3-001 and BSMUC16/CD3-005 were about 29-fold and 2.9-fold less, respectively, than terminal antibody concentrations determined for the isotype control (0.86 &#x3bc;g/mL).</p><p id="p-0404" num="0363">A summary of the data for total anti-MUC16&#xd7;CD3 bispecific antibodies and isotype control antibody concentrations are summarized in Table 10. Mean PK parameters are described in Tables 11A and 11B. Mean total antibody concentrations versus time are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</figref>, and <b>3</b>. In conclusion, MUC16&#xd7;CD3 bispecific antibodies exhibited similar C<sub>max </sub>and drug elimination curves in WT mice, but BSMUC16/CD3-001 displayed steeper elimination rates than BSMUC16/CD3-005 and the isotype control in CD3 single-humanized mice and MUC16/CD3 double humanized mice. Since the bispecific antibodies administered in this PK study are comprised of the same anti-MUC16 binding arm, the results suggest that the strength of binding of the CD3 targeting arm may play a role in drug exposure levels (AUC<sub>last</sub>) and drug elimination rates. Neither BSMUC16/CD3-001 or BSMUC16/CD3-005 bind mouse MUC16 or mouse CD3.</p><p id="p-0405" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00016" num="00016"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"

OVCAR-3 cells endogenously express MUC-16.</p><p id="p-0410" num="0366">Briefly, NSG mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 5.0&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>human PBMCs. 8d later, 1.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>ascites cells from the OVCAR-3/Luc cell line, previously passaged in vivo, were administered i.p. to the NSG mice engrafted with PBMCs. In the immediate treatment group, mice were treated i.p. on the day of OVCAR-3/Luc cell implantation with MUC16/CD3 Bispecific antibodies BSMUC16/CD3-001 or BSMUC16/CD3-005, or an isotype control, at a dose of 10 &#x3bc;g/mouse (N=5 mice/treatment group). In the therapeutic dose model, mice were treated i.p. 7d post tumor implantation with the MUC16/CD3 Bispecific or control antibodies described above, at a dose of 10 &#x3bc;g/mouse (N=5/treatment group).</p><p id="p-0411" num="0367">In all studies, tumor growth was monitored via bioluminescent imaging (BLI). Mice were injected i.p. with the luciferase substrate D-luciferin suspended in PBS (150 mg/kg) and imaged under isoflurane anesthesia after 10 min. BLI was performed using the Xenogen IVIS system (Perkin Elmer, Hopkinton, Mass.) and BLI signals were extracted using Living Image software (Xenogen/Perkin Elmer). Regions of interest were drawn around each cell mass and photon intensities were recorded as photons(p)/sec(s)/cm<sup>2</sup>/steradian(sr). For the immediate-treatment group, data is shown as BLI levels 26d post tumor implantation (Table 12A). For the therapeutic-treatment group, data is shown as fold-change in BLI between day 6 (1 d before treatment) and at study endpoint (26d post tumor implantation; Table 12B).</p><p id="p-0412" num="0368">As the results show, both BSMUC16/CD3-001 and BSMUC16/CD3-005 showed similar efficacy in suppressing tumor growth compared to the isotype control when BLI was measured at Day 26 in the immediate dosing model. Both anti-MUC16/anti-CD3 bispecific antibodies also suppressed the growth of established tumors when administered 7d post tumor implantation, compared to the control. In summary, the bispecific anti-MUC16/anti-CD3 antibodies of this invention display potent anti-tumor efficacy in several models.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00019" num="00019"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 12A</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Efficacy of anti-MUC16/anti-CD3 Bispecific Antibodies</entry></row><row><entry>in Immune-Compromised Xenograft Model: Immediate Dosing</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Avg Bioluminescent</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Radiance</entry></row><row><entry>Tumor Model/</entry><entry>Bispecific</entry><entry/><entry>(photons/sec/</entry></row><row><entry>Mouse Strain/</entry><entry>Antibody</entry><entry/><entry>cm<sup>2</sup>/steradian)</entry></row><row><entry>Dose</entry><entry>Identifier</entry><entry>N</entry><entry>Day 26 (mean &#xb1; SD)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>OVCAR-3/Luc/</entry><entry>BSMUC16/CD3-001</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>1.4 &#xd7; 10<sup>3 </sup>&#xb1; 3.5 &#xd7; 10<sup>2</sup></entry></row><row><entry>NSG/</entry><entry>BSMUC16/CD3-005</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>1.5 &#xd7; 10<sup>3 </sup>&#xb1; 9.7 &#xd7; 10<sup>2</sup></entry></row><row><entry>10 &#x3bc;g/mouse</entry><entry>Isotype Control</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>2.0 &#xd7; 10<sup>7 </sup>&#xb1; 1.0 &#xd7; 10<sup>6</sup></entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0414" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00020" num="00020"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 12B</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Efficacy of anti-Muc16/anti-CD3 Bispecific Antibodies in</entry></row><row><entry>Immune-Compromised Xenograft Model: Therapeutic Treatment</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Fold change in Avg</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Bioluminescent Radiance</entry></row><row><entry>Tumor Model/</entry><entry>Bispecific</entry><entry/><entry>[p/s/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr]</entry></row><row><entry>Mouse Strain/</entry><entry>Antibody</entry><entry/><entry>at Day 26 relative to</entry></row><row><entry>Dose</entry><entry>Identifier</entry><entry>N</entry><entry>Day 6 (mean &#xb1; SD)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>OVCAR-3/Luc/</entry><entry>BSMUC16/CD3-001</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>2.0 &#xb1; 5.0</entry></row><row><entry>NSG/</entry><entry>BSMUC16/CD3-005</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>0.01 &#xb1; 0.02</entry></row><row><entry>10 &#x3bc;g/mouse</entry><entry>Isotype Control</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>21.0 &#xb1; 8.0&#x2002;</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0415" num="0369">In further experiments, the in vivo efficacy of an anti-MUC16/anti-CD3 bispecific antibody was evaluated in xenogenic and syngeneic tumor models. For the first xenogenic model, NSG mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with OVCAR-3/Luc cells previously passaged in vivo (Day 0) eleven days after engraftment with human PBMCs. Mice were treated IP with 0.01, 0.1, or 0.5 mg/kg BSMUC16/CD3-001, or administered 0.5 mg/kg non-binding control or CD3-binding control on Days 6, 10, 13, 16, and 21. Tumor burden was assessed by BLI on Days 6, 14, and 20 post tumor implantation. Treatment with 0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg of BSMUC16/CD3-001 resulted in significant anti-tumor efficacy as determined by BLI measurements on Day 20, as shown in Tables 13A-C and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>. For the second xenogenic model, NSG mice were injected with OVCAR-3/Luc cells previously passaged in vivo (Day 0) thirteen days after engraftment with human PBMCs and a second batch of PBMCs were transferred on Day 4. Mice were treated intravenously (IV) with 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 5 mg/kg BSMUC16/CD3-005 or administered 5 mg/kg non-binding control or CD3-binding control on Days 5, 8, 12, 15, 19 and 22. Tumor burden was assessed by BLI on Days 4, 11, 18 and 25. Treatment with 0.5, 1, or 5 mg/kg BSMUC16/CD3-005 resulted in significant anti-tumor efficacy as shown by BLI measurements and fold changes (Tables 13D-F and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>). To examine efficacy in an immune-competent model, the murine CD3 gene was replaced with human CD3 and a portion of the mouse MUC16 gene was replaced with the human sequence. The replacements resulted in a mouse whose T cells express human CD3 and that expresses a chimeric MUC16 molecule containing a portion of human MUC16 where the BSMUC16/CD3-001 bispecific antibody binds. For the syngeneic tumor model, ID8-VEGF cell lines engineered to express the portion of human MUC16 were used. Mice were implanted with the ID8-VEGF/huMUC16 cells subcutaneously and treated with 100 &#x3bc;g of BSMUC16/CD3-001 either on day of implantation or ten days after implantation when tumors were established. Treatment with 100 &#x3bc;g BSMUC16/CD3-001 resulted in significant anti-tumor efficacy, as shown in Table 13G and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0370">Implantation and Measurement of Xenograft Tumors:</p><p id="p-0417" num="0371">Ascites cells from the OVCAR-3/Luc cell line, previously passaged in vivo, were administered IP into the NSG mice previously engrafted with human PBMCs.

Statistical significance for the BLI results was determined using an unpaired nonparametric Mann-Whitney t-test. Fold changes were calculated by the formula: (Day20-Day6)/Day6 for study 1 and (Day25-Day4)/Day4 for study 2.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0374">Implantation and Measurement of Syngeneic Tumors:</p><p id="p-0421" num="0375">Mice expressing human CD3 and a human-murine chimera of MUC16 in the corresponding mouse loci were implanted with 10e6 ID8-VEGF/huMUC16 cells subcutaneously (SC).

For intraperitoneal (IP) tumors, mice were randomized into treatment groups, and dosed with either anti-MUC16 drug conjugated antibodies (see Example 9), a non-binding conjugated antibody, or vehicle following detection of tumor luminescent signal. For subcutaneous (SC) xenografts, once tumors had reached an average volume of 200 mm<sup>3 </sup>(&#x2dc;Day 16), mice were randomized into treatment groups, and dosed with either anti-MUC16 drug conjugated antibodies, a non-binding conjugated antibody, or vehicle. In these in vivo studies, antibodies were dosed and tumors were then monitored until ascites developed or an average tumor size of approximately 1200 mm<sup>3 </sup>was attained in the cohort dosed with vehicle alone. At this point the Tumor Growth Inhibition was calculated.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0384">In an initial intraperitoneal (IP) study, exemplary anti-MUC16 antibodies conjugated to Compound 7 were examined for efficacy in reducing OVCAR3/luc luminescent signal. Mice received four once weekly doses of anti-MUC16 and control ADCs at 85 &#x3bc;g/kg of drug equivalent based on ADC drug:antibody ratios. As summarized in Table 15A, H1H9519N-Compound 7 and H1H9521N-Compound 7 potently inhibited ascites tumor growth. These anti-MUC16 ADCs efficiently reduced tumor size, with a 100 percent reduction in tumor luminescence relative to vehicle control. The Control ADC did not mediate any inhibition of OVCAR/luc ascites tumor cell growth.</p><p id="p-0439" num="0385">A further study assessing the efficacy of anti-MUC16 ADCs against subcutaneous (SC) OVCAR3/luc tumor is summarized in Table 15B. Mice received four once weekly doses of anti-MUC16 and control ADCs at 85 &#x3bc;g/kg of drug equivalent based on ADC drug:antibody ratios. When conjugated to Compound 7, MUC16 ADCs H1H9519N-Compound 7 and H1H9521N-Compound 7 again produced significant anti-tumor effect; this time against the subcutaneous OVCAR3/luc tumors. Accordingly, these ADCs mediated a 100% and 109% inhibition of tumor growth respectively. Control ADC did not mediate any inhibition of OVCAR/luc subcutaneous tumor growth.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0386">In a third study, the efficacy of the anti-MUC16 antibody H1H9521N conjugated to the linker drug Compound 10 was assessed in the IP OVCAR3/luc tumor model. Mice received single doses of anti-MUC16 and control ADCs at 85 &#x3bc;g/kg, 170 &#x3bc;g/kg and 340 &#x3bc;g/kg of drug equivalent based on ADC drug:antibody ratios. As summarized in Table 15C, H1H9519N-10 potently inhibited ascites tumor growth. The doses of H1H9519N-Compound 10 resulted in a 99-100% inhibition of tumor luminescence relative to vehicle control. Some inhibition was observed with Control ADC using Compound 10 although this was more moderate than that observed following anti-MUC16 H1H9519N-Compound 10.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00029" num="00029"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 15A</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Inhibition of OVCAR3/luc IP Tumor Growth at Day 49 in SCID mice</entry></row><row><entry>treated with anti-MUC16 antibodies conjugated to Compound 7</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Final Tumor</entry><entry>Average Tumor</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Average Radiance</entry><entry>Growth Inhibition</entry></row><row><entry>Treatment Group</entry><entry>(mean &#xb1;

The antibody immune response was monitored by a CD3-specific immunoassay. When a desired immune response was achieved, splenocytes were harvested and fused with mouse myeloma cells to preserve their viability and form hybridoma cell lines. The hybridoma cell lines were screened and selected to identify cell lines that produce CD3-specific antibodies. Using this technique several anti-CD3 chimeric antibodies (i.e., antibodies possessing human variable domains and mouse constant domains) were obtained. In addition, several fully human anti-CD3 antibodies were isolated directly from antigen-positive B cells without fusion to myeloma cells, as described in US 2007/0280945A1.</p><p id="p-0445" num="0388">Certain biological properties of the exemplary anti-CD3 antibodies generated in accordance with the methods of this Example are described in detail in the Examples herein.</p><heading id="h-0040" level="1">Example 12: Heavy and Light Chain Variable Region Amino Acid and Nucleic Acid Sequences</heading><p id="p-0446" num="0389">Table 16 sets forth the amino acid sequence identifiers of the heavy and light chain variable regions and CDRs of selected anti-CD3 antibodies of the invention.

nomenclature: Fc prefix (e.g. &#x201c;H1H,&#x201d; &#x201c;H1M,&#x201d; &#x201c;H2M,&#x201d; etc.), followed by a numerical identifier (e.g. &#x201c;2712,&#x201d; &#x201c;2692,&#x201d; etc., as shown in Table 1), followed by a &#x201c;P,&#x201d; &#x201c;N,&#x201d; or &#x201c;B&#x201d; suffix. Thus, according to this nomenclature, an antibody may be referred to herein as, e.g., &#x201c;H1H2712N,&#x201d; &#x201c;H1M2692N,&#x201d; &#x201c;H2M2689N,&#x201d; etc. The H1H, H1M and H2M prefixes on the antibody designations used herein indicate the particular Fc region isotype of the antibody. For example, an &#x201c;H1H&#x201d; antibody has a human IgG1 Fc, an &#x201c;H1M&#x201d; antibody has a mouse IgG1 Fc, and an &#x201c;H2M&#x201d; antibody has a mouse IgG2 Fc, (all variable regions are fully human as denoted by the first &#x2018;H&#x2019; in the antibody designation). As will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, an antibody having a particular Fc isotype can be converted to an antibody with a different Fc isotype (e.g., an antibody with a mouse IgG1 Fc can be converted to an antibody with a human IgG4, etc.), but in any event, the variable domains (including the CDRs)&#x2014;which are indicated by the numerical identifiers shown in Table 1&#x2014;will remain the same, and the binding properties are expected to be identical or substantially similar regardless of the nature of the Fc domain.</p><p id="p-0450" num="0391">Tables 18 and 19

Monoclonal Anti-CD3 Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0471" num="0404">In vivo and in vitro studies on human monoclonal anti-CD3 antibodies were done as described in US publication 2014/0088295 published Mar. 27, 2014, and PCT/US2016/044732 filed Jul. 29, 2016, which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0472" num="0405">Some human monoclonal anti-CD3 antibodies of the present invention bind soluble heterodimeric CD3 protein, in either antibody-capture or antigen-capture formats, with high affinity. Soluble heterodimeric CD3 protein (hCD3-epsilon/hCD3-delta; SEQ ID NOs: 1900/1901) was prepared with either a human Fc tag (hFc&#x394;Adp/hFc; SEQ ID NOs: 1931/1932) or a mouse Fc tag (mFc&#x394;Adp/mFc; SEQ ID NOs: 1933/1934). Heterodimeric CD3 protein was purified using the method described in Davis et al. (US2010/0331527).</p><p id="p-0473" num="0406">Some human monoclonal anti-CD3 antibodies of the invention bound human T-cells and induced T-cell proliferation. Some human monoclonal anti-CD3 antibodies of the invention bound CD2+CD4+ monkey T-cells and induced their proliferation. Some human monoclonal anti-CD3 antibodies supported redirected T-cell mediated killing via Fc/FcR interaction in a calcein based U937 killing assay. The observed killing, believed to be dependent on the antibody's Fc engagement with the Fc Receptor on U937 cells leading to clustering of CD3 on adjacent T-cells, was squelched by addition of non-specific human IgG (data not shown). A wide range of bispecific antibodies constructed with anti-CD3 arm variants described herein (particularly anti-CD3 arms based on the CD3-VH-P heavy chain derived from IGHV3-9*01, IGHJ6*02, IGHD5-12*01) activate human PBMC cells, and monkey PBMCs, and display cytotoxic activity on tumor antigen-expressing cell lines.</p><heading id="h-0045" level="1">Example 16: Screening and Identification of Anti-MUC16 Monoclonal Antibodies Suitable for Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) Samples</heading><p id="p-0474" num="0407">Human tumor cell lines with known levels of expression of MUC16 were identified, fixed in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin and embedded in paraffin. These lines were used to screen various anti-MUC16 antibodies to identify candidates for IHC studies.</p><p id="p-0475" num="0408">Cell lines included the following MUC16 Negative cell lines: HT29 (Colon), and PC3/ATCC parental (Prostate); Pancreatic cell lines with low to no levels of MUC16: Capan1 (Pancreatic adenocarcinoma), HPAC (Pancreatic adenocarcinoma). Endogenously MUC16-expressing cell lines include: OVCAR3 (Ovarian) and PEO-1 (Serous ovarian carcinoma).</p><p id="p-0476" num="0409">Transfected cell lines were engineered as follows: PC3/ATCC (parental Prostate cancer line) cells were transfected to generate PC3/MUC16 &#x201c;short&#x201d; and PC3/MUC16 &#x201c;high&#x201d; cell lines. Both constructs include the C-terminal domain of MUC16 from amino acids 13,810-14,507 (of SEQ ID NO: 1899), and this includes part of the SEA12 domain, SEA13, SEA14, SEA15, SEA16, the C-terminal non-SEA region, the transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic domain. In addition, the PC3/MUC high cells have additional N-terminal amino acids 12783-13467 (of SEQ ID NO: 1899) which include SEA5 (partial) through SEA9 and a short linker between the SEA9 domain and the start of the MUC16 short construct. This allows for differentiation between anti-MUC16 antibodies that bind in the repeat region and those that bind to the &#x201c;nub&#x201d; portion of MUC16 adjacent to the membrane following enzymatic cleavage and release of the repeat regions (analogous to the CA125 portion of MUC16).</p><p id="p-0477" num="0410">All staining was performed on the Ventana Discovery XT autostainer using standard protocols. Cell pellets were deparaffinized, Heat Induced Epitope Retrieval was optimized, endogenous Biotin was blocked and Protein blocking was performed. The antibodies were applied manually at an initial concentration of 10 &#x3bc;g/ml and were also titrated down to ensure the specificity of the signal. Comparison was made against a commercially available anti-MUC16 antibody (OC-125), which is specific for the repeat regions of CA-125 (Roche, Ventana Catalog#760-2610), and a negative control (absence of primary antibody). Detection was with Donkey anti-mouse-Biotin followed by Streptavidin-Horseradish peroxidase. The conversion of the substrate, Di-amino Benzidine (DAB) was observed as brown staining. Samples were counterstained with hematoxylin to visualize the nuclei. The results of the staining experiments are presented in Table 26, below.</p><p id="p-0478" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00042" num="00042"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="308pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 26</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Binding of anti-MUC16 Antibodies to MUC16-negative Cells, and</entry></row><row><entry>Cells Expressing MUC16 or Membrane-Proximal Portions of MUC16</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>PC3/ATCC</entry><entry>PC3/MUC16</entry><entry>PC3/MUC16</entry></row><row><entry>Cell line:</entry><entry>HT29</entry><entry>Capan1</entry><entry>HPAC</entry><entry>OVCAR3</entry><entry>PEO-1</entry><entry>parental</entry><entry>Short</entry><entry>High</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>H1M7130N</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+++</entry><entry>++</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+++</entry><entry>+++</entry></row><row><entry>H2aM7128N</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+</entry><entry>+++</entry><entry>++</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+++</entry><entry>+++</entry></row><row><entry>H2aM7131N</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+++</entry><entry>++</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+++</entry><entry>+++</entry></row><row><entry>H2aM7133N</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+++</entry><entry>++</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry></row><row><entry>H2aM7138N</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+</entry><entry>+++</entry><entry>++</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+++</entry><entry>+++</entry></row><row><entry>H1M9519N</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>NT</entry><entry>NT</entry><entry>+++</entry><entry>+++</entry><entry>NT</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+++</entry></row><row><entry>H3M9525N</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>NT</entry><entry>NT</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>NT</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry></row><row><entry>OC-125</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+</entry><entry>+++</entry><entry>++</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+++</entry></row><row><entry>Neg.
