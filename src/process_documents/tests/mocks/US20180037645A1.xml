Rev. Biochem. </i>59:783 (1990); Mosmann, <i>Curr. Opin. Immunol. </i>3:311 (1991); Paul et al., <i>Cell, </i>76:241 (1994)). Cytokine-induced immune functions can also include an inflammatory response, characterized by a systemic or local accumulation of immune cells. Although they do have host-protective effects, these immune responses can produce pathological consequences when the response involves excessive and/or chronic inflammation, as in autoimmune disorders (such as multiple sclerosis) and cancer/neoplastic diseases (Oppenheim et al., eds., <i>Cytokine Reference</i>, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (2001); von Andrian et al., <i>New Engl. J. Med., </i>343:1020 (2000); Davidson et al., <i>New Engl. J. Med., </i>345:340 (2001); Lu et al., <i>Mol. Cancer Res., </i>4:221 (2006); Dalgleish et al., <i>Cancer Treat Res., </i>130:1 (2006)).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-23 are cytokines involved in inflammation. IL-17A induces the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x3b2;, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-6, and IL-23 by synovial fibroblasts, monocytes, and macrophages, all of which promote inflammation and Th17 development. IL-17A also induces an array of chemokines, including CXCL-1, CXCL-2, CXCL-5, CXCL-8, CCL-2, and CCL-20, leading to recruitment of T cells, B cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. Lundy, S. K., <i>Arthritis Res. Ther., </i>9:202 (2007). IL-17F shares the greatest homology (55%) with IL-17A and is also a proinflammatory cytokine. Both IL-17A and IL-17F are produced by Th17 cells, whereas the other IL-17 family members, IL-17B, IL-17C, and IL-17D, are produced by non-T cell sources. IL-17A and IL-17F can exist as IL-17A homodimers and IL-17F homodimers or as IL-17A/F heterodimers. Liang, S. C. et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>179:7791-7799 (2007). IL-17A is increased in rheumatoid arthritis sera and synovial fluid, and is present in the T-cell rich areas of the synovium. Shahrara, S., <i>Arthritis Res. Ther., </i>10:R93 (2005). IL-17A can also orchestrate bone and cartilage damage. An effective blockade of IL-17 will need to neutralize IL-17A homodimers, IL-17F homodimers and IL-17A/F heterodimers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">IL-23 is a type-1 heterodimer, comprising a 19 kilodalton (kD) fourfold helical core a subunit (IL-23p19), disulfide linked to an additional 40 kD distinct 13 subunit (IL-12p40). IL-23 is a key cytokine in bridging the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response; it is produced early in response to an antigen challenge, and is essential for driving early local immune responses. Furthermore, IL-23 plays a central role in the activation of NK cells, the enhancement of T cell proliferation and the regulation of antibody production. IL-23 also regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-&#x3b3;), which are important in cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens. Recent reports have indicated that in humans increased amounts of IL-23 have been associated with several autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Lyme arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD), psoriasis and multiple sclerosis (MS). IL-23p19 knock-out mice were resistant to autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and central nervous system autoimmune induction. IL-23 is not essential for the development of human Th17 cells, but appears to be required for their survival and/or expansion. Paradowska-Gorycka, A., <i>Scandinavian Journal of Immunology, </i>71:134-145 (2010). Genetic studies revealed an association between IL-23 receptor genes and susceptibility to several autoimmune diseases including CD, RA and Graves' ophthalmopathy. The IL-23-Th17 axis is crucial to autoimmune disease development. Leng et al., <i>Archives of Medical Research, </i>41:221-225 (2010).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The demonstrated activities of IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-23p19 in mediating and promoting several autoimmune diseases illustrate the clinical potential of, and need for, molecules which can antagonize these targets. The present invention, as set forth herein, meets these and other needs.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic illustration of a whole antibody and its modular components.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a model of a bispecific antibody designated biAbFabL which contains a whole antibody with a C-terminal Fab unit of the second arm of the bispecific antibody attached via a linker, and which utilizes a common light chain.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a model of a bispecific antibody designated taFab which contains a whole antibody with an N-terminal Fab unit of the second arm of the bispecific antibody attached via a linker.

The invention also includes isolated nucleic acids encoding the heavy chains and light chains of the bispecific antibodies of the invention, as well as vectors comprising the nucleic acids, host cells comprising the vectors, and methods of making and using the bispecific antibodies.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other embodiments, the present invention provides compositions comprising the bispecific antibodies and kits comprising the bispecific antibodies, as well as articles of manufacture comprising the bispecific antibodies.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The bispecific antibodies of the present invention are useful for the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-23p19. The antibodies can be used to reduce, limit, neutralize, or block the proinflammatory effects of the IL-17A homodimer, the IL-17F homodimer, or the IL-17A/F heterodimer. Likewise, the antibodies can be used to reduce, limit, neutralize, or block the pro-cancerous effects of the IL-17A homodimer, the IL-17F homodimer, or the IL-17A/F heterodimer. In such cases, the anti-IL-23p19 portion of the antibody is used to reduce, limit, neutralize, or block production of new T cells that would produce IL-17A and/or IL-17F, including homodimers and heterodimers. The bispecific antibodies described herein can be used to treat inflammatory disorders and autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) and giant cell arteritis. The bispecific antibodies described herein can also be used to treat cancer, including angiogenesis. For instance, the bispecific antibodies as described herein can be used to treat multiple-myeloma-induced lytic bone disease (Sotomayor, E. M., <i>Blood, </i>116(18):3380-3382 (2010)).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the description that follows, a number of terms are used extensively. The following definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the invention.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Unless otherwise specified, &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, &#x201c;the&#x201d;, and &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; are used interchangeably and mean one or more than one.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">&#x201c;Antibodies&#x201d; (Abs) and &#x201c;immunoglobulins&#x201d; (Igs) are glycoproteins having the same structural characteristics. While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen, immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other antibody-like molecules that lack antigen specificity. Polypeptides of the latter kind are, for example, produced at low levels by the lymph system and at increased levels by myelomas. Thus, as used herein, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; or &#x201c;antibody peptide(s)&#x201d; refers to an intact antibody, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that competes with the intact antibody for specific binding and includes chimeric, humanized, fully human, and bispecific antibodies. In certain embodiments, antigen-binding fragments are produced, for example, by recombinant DNA techniques. In additional embodiments, antigen-binding fragments are produced by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Antigen-binding fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab)<sup>2</sup>, F(ab&#x2032;)<sup>2</sup>, Fv, and single-chain antibodies.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term &#x201c;isolated antibody&#x201d; as used herein refers to an antibody that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term &#x201c;agonist&#x201d; refers to any compound including a protein, polypeptide, peptide, antibody, antibody fragment, large molecule, or small molecule (less than 10 kD), that increases the activity, activation or function of another molecule.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The term &#x201c;antagonist&#x201d; refers to any compound including a protein, polypeptide, peptide, antibody, antibody fragment, large molecule, or small molecule (less than 10 kD), that decreases the activity, activation or function of another molecule.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The term &#x201c;bind(ing) of a polypeptide&#x201d; includes, but is not limited to, the binding of a ligand polypeptide of the present invention to a receptor; the binding of a receptor polypeptide of the present invention to a ligand; the binding of an antibody of the present invention to an antigen or epitope; the binding of an antigen or epitope of the present invention to an antibody; the binding of an antibody of the present invention to an anti-idiotypic antibody; the binding of an anti-idiotypic antibody of the present invention to a ligand; the binding of an anti-idiotypic antibody of the present invention to a receptor; the binding of an anti-anti-idiotypic antibody of the present invention to a ligand, receptor or antibody, etc.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A &#x201c;bispecific&#x201d; or &#x201c;bifunctional&#x201d; antibody is a hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies may be produced by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab&#x2032; fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai et al., <i>Clin. Exp. Immunol., </i>79:315-321 (1990); Kostelny et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>148:1547-1553 (1992).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein, the term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; refers to the portion of an antigen to which an antibody specifically binds. Thus, the term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. More specifically, the term &#x201c;IL-17 epitope&#x201d;, &#x201c;IL-23 epitope&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;IL-23/p19 epitope&#x201d; as used herein refers to a portion of the corresponding polypeptide having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an animal, preferably in a mammal, and most preferably in a mouse or a human. An epitope having immunogenic activity is a portion of, for example, an IL-17A or IL-17F or IL-23/p19 polypeptide that elicits an antibody response in an animal. An epitope having antigenic activity is a portion of, for example, an IL-17A or IL-17F or IL-23/p19 polypeptide to which an antibody immunospecifically binds as determined by any method well known in the art, for example, by immunoassays, protease digest, crystallography or H/D-Exchange. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic. Such epitopes can be linear in nature or can be a discontinuous epitope. Thus, as used herein, the term &#x201c;conformational epitope&#x201d; refers to a discontinuous epitope formed by a spatial relationship between amino acids of an antigen other than an unbroken series of amino acids.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As used herein, the term &#x201c;immunoglobulin&#x201d; refers to a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes. One form of immunoglobulin constitutes the basic structural unit of an antibody. This form is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of immunoglobulin chains, each pair having one light and one heavy chain. In each pair, the light and heavy chain variable regions are together responsible for binding to an antigen, and the constant regions are responsible for the antibody effector functions.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Full-length immunoglobulin &#x201c;light chains&#x201d; (about 25 Kd or about 214 amino acids) are encoded by a variable region gene at the NH2-terminus (about 110 amino acids) and a kappa or lambda constant region gene at the COOH-terminus. Full-length immunoglobulin &#x201c;heavy chains&#x201d; (about 50 Kd or about 446 amino acids), are similarly encoded by a variable region gene (about 116 amino acids) and one of the other aforementioned constant region genes (about 330 amino acids). Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgG (such as IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4), IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a &#x201c;J&#x201d; region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a &#x201c;D&#x201d; region of about 10 more amino acids. (See generally, <i>Fundamental Immunology </i>(Paul, W., ed., 2nd Edition, Raven Press, NY (1989)), Chapter 7 (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An immunoglobulin light or heavy chain variable region consists of a &#x201c;framework&#x201d; region interrupted by three hypervariable regions. Thus, the term &#x201c;hypervariable region&#x201d; refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a &#x201c;Complementarity Determining Region&#x201d; or &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; (Kabat et al., <i>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, </i>5th Edition, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)) and/or those residues from a &#x201c;hypervariable loop&#x201d; (Chothia et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>196: 901-917 (1987)) (both of which are incorporated herein by reference). &#x201c;Framework Region&#x201d; or &#x201c;FR&#x201d; residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. The sequences of the framework regions of different light or heavy chains are relatively conserved within a species. Thus, a &#x201c;human framework region&#x201d; is a framework region that is substantially identical (about 85% or more, usually 90-95% or more) to the framework region of a naturally occurring human immunoglobulin. The framework region of an antibody, that is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains, serves to position and align the CDR's. The CDR's are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of an antigen. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; immunoglobulin refers to an immunoglobulin comprising a human framework region and one or more CDR's from a non-human (usually a mouse or rat) immunoglobulin. The non-human immunoglobulin providing the CDR's is called the &#x201c;donor&#x201d; and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is called the &#x201c;acceptor&#x201d;. Constant regions need not be present, but if they are, they must be substantially identical to human immunoglobulin constant regions, i.e., at least about 85-90%, preferably about 95% or more identical. Hence, all parts of a humanized immunoglobulin, except possibly the CDR's, are substantially identical to corresponding parts of natural human immunoglobulin sequences. Further, one or more residues in the human framework region may be back mutated to the parental sequence to retain optimal antigen-binding affinity and specificity. In this way, certain framework residues from the non-human parent antibody are retained in the humanized antibody in order to retain the binding properties of the parent antibody while minimizing its immunogenicity. The term &#x201c;human framework region&#x201d; as used herein includes regions with such back mutations. A &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d; is an antibody comprising a humanized light chain and a humanized heavy chain immunoglobulin. For example, a humanized antibody would not encompass a typical chimeric antibody as defined above, e.g., because the entire variable region of a chimeric antibody is non-human.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The term &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; immunoglobulin refers to an immunoglobulin comprising a human framework region and one or more CDR's from a non-human, e.g., mouse, rat or rabbit, immunoglobulin. The non-human immunoglobulin providing the CDR's is called the &#x201c;donor&#x201d; and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is called the &#x201c;acceptor&#x201d;. Constant regions need not be present, but if they are, they must be substantially identical to human immunoglobulin constant regions, i.e., at least about 85-90%, preferably about 95% or more identical. Hence, all parts of a humanized immunoglobulin, except possibly the CDR's and possibly a few back-mutated amino acid residues in the framework region (e.g., 1-15 residues), are substantially identical to corresponding parts of natural human immunoglobulin sequences. A &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d; is an antibody comprising a humanized light chain and a humanized heavy chain immunoglobulin. For example, a humanized antibody would not encompass a typical chimeric antibody as defined above, e.g., because the entire variable region of a chimeric antibody is non-human.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, the term &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d; includes an antibody that has an amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and includes antibodies isolated from human immunoglobulin libraries or from animals transgenic for one or more human immunoglobulin and that do not express endogenous immunoglobulins, as described, for example, by Kucherlapati et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,598.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The term &#x201c;genetically altered antibodies&#x201d; means antibodies wherein the amino acid sequence has been varied from that of a native antibody. Because of the relevance of recombinant DNA techniques in the generation of antibodies, one need not be confined to the sequences of amino acids found in natural antibodies; antibodies can be redesigned to obtain desired characteristics. The possible variations are many and range from the changing of just one or a few amino acids to the complete redesign of, for example, the variable and/or constant region. Changes in the constant region will, in general, be made in order to improve or alter characteristics, such as complement fixation, interaction with membranes and other effector functions. Changes in the variable region will be made in order to improve the antigen binding characteristics.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A &#x201c;Fab fragment&#x201d; is comprised of one light chain and the C<sub>H1 </sub>and variable regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of a Fab molecule cannot form a disulfide bond with another heavy chain molecule.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A &#x201c;Fab&#x2032; fragment&#x201d; contains one light chain and one heavy chain that contains more of the constant region, between the C<sub>H1 </sub>and C<sub>H2 </sub>domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between two heavy chains to form a F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>molecule.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A &#x201c;F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment&#x201d; contains two light chains and two heavy chains containing a portion of the constant region between the C<sub>H1 </sub>and C<sub>H2 </sub>domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond is formed between two heavy chains.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A &#x201c;Fv fragment&#x201d; contains the variable regions from both heavy and light chains but lacks the constant regions.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A &#x201c;single domain antibody&#x201d; is an antibody fragment consisting of a single domain Fv unit, e.g., V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L</sub>. Like a whole antibody, it is able to bind selectively to a specific antigen. With a molecular weight of only 12-15 kDa, single-domain antibodies are much smaller than common antibodies (150-160 kDa) which are composed of two heavy protein chains and two light chains, and even smaller than Fab fragments (&#x2dc;50 kDa, one light chain and half a heavy chain) and single-chain variable fragments (&#x2dc;25 kDa, two variable domains, one from a light and one from a heavy chain). The first single-domain antibodies were engineered from heavy-chain antibodies found in camelids. Although most research into single-domain antibodies is currently based on heavy chain variable domains, light chain variable domains and nanobodies derived from light chains have also been shown to bind specifically to target epitopes.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; or &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; refers to polynucleotides, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA), oligonucleotides, fragments generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fragments generated by any of ligation, scission, endonuclease action, and exonuclease action. Nucleic acid molecules can be composed of monomers that are naturally-occurring nucleotides (such as DNA and RNA), or analogs of naturally-occurring nucleotides (e.g., &#x3b1;-enantiomeric forms of naturally-occurring nucleotides), or a combination of both. Modified nucleotides can have alterations in sugar moieties and/or in pyrimidine or purine base moieties. Sugar modifications include, for example, replacement of one or more hydroxyl groups with halogens, alkyl groups, amines, and azido groups, or sugars can be functionalized as ethers or esters. Moreover, the entire sugar moiety can be replaced with sterically and electronically similar structures, such as aza-sugars and carbocyclic sugar analogs. Examples of modifications in a base moiety include alkylated purines and pyrimidines, acylated purines or pyrimidines, or other well-known heterocyclic substitutes. Nucleic acid monomers can be linked by phosphodiester bonds or analogs of such linkages. Analogs of phosphodiester linkages include phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phosphoranilidate, phosphoramidate, and the like. The term &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; also includes so-called &#x201c;peptide nucleic acids&#x201d;, which comprise naturally-occurring or modified nucleic acid bases attached to a polyamide backbone. Nucleic acids can be either single stranded or double stranded.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The term &#x201c;complement of a nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid molecule having a complementary nucleotide sequence and reverse orientation as compared to a reference nucleotide sequence.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The term &#x201c;degenerate nucleotide sequence&#x201d; denotes a sequence of nucleotides that includes one or more degenerate codons as compared to a reference nucleic acid molecule that encodes a polypeptide. Degenerate codons contain different triplets of nucleotides, but encode the same amino acid residue (i.e., GAU and GAC triplets each encode Asp).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">An &#x201c;isolated nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; is a nucleic acid molecule that is not integrated in the genomic DNA of an organism. For example, a DNA molecule that encodes a growth factor that has been separated from the genomic DNA of a cell is an isolated DNA molecule. Another example of an isolated nucleic acid molecule is a chemically-synthesized nucleic acid molecule that is not integrated in the genome of an organism. A nucleic acid molecule that has been isolated from a particular species is smaller than the complete DNA molecule of a chromosome from that species.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule construct&#x201d; is a nucleic acid molecule, either single- or double-stranded, that has been modified through human intervention to contain segments of nucleic acid combined and juxtaposed in an arrangement not existing in nature.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">&#x201c;Complementary DNA (cDNA)&#x201d; is a single-stranded DNA molecule that is formed from an mRNA template by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Typically, a primer complementary to portions of mRNA is employed for the initiation of reverse transcription. Those skilled in the art also use the term &#x201c;cDNA&#x201d; to refer to a double-stranded DNA molecule consisting of such a single-stranded DNA molecule and its complementary DNA strand. The term &#x201c;cDNA&#x201d; also refers to a clone of a cDNA molecule synthesized from an RNA template.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A &#x201c;promoter&#x201d; is a nucleotide sequence that directs the transcription of a structural gene. Typically, a promoter is located in the 5&#x2032; non-coding region of a gene, proximal to the transcriptional start site of a structural gene. Sequence elements within promoters that function in the initiation of transcription are often characterized by consensus nucleotide sequences. These promoter elements include RNA polymerase binding sites, TATA sequences, CAAT sequences, differentiation-specific elements (DSEs; McGehee et al., <i>Mol. Endocrinol., </i>7:551 (1993)), cyclic AMP response elements (CREs), serum response elements (SREs; Treisman, <i>Seminars in Cancer Biol., </i>1:47 (1990)), glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), and binding sites for other transcription factors, such as CRE/ATF (O'Reilly et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>267:19938 (1992)), AP2 (Ye et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>269:25728 (1994)), SP1, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB; Loeken, <i>Gene Expr., </i>3:253 (1993)) and octamer factors (see, in general, Watson et al., eds., <i>Molecular Biology of the Gene, </i>4th Edition, The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc. (1987), and Lemaigre et al., <i>Biochem. J., </i>303:1 (1994)). If a promoter is an inducible promoter, then the rate of transcription increases in response to an inducing agent. In contrast, the rate of transcription is not regulated by an inducing agent if the promoter is a constitutive promoter. Repressible promoters are also known.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A &#x201c;regulatory element&#x201d; is a nucleotide sequence that modulates the activity of a core promoter. For example, a regulatory element may contain a nucleotide sequence that binds with cellular factors enabling transcription exclusively or preferentially in particular cells, tissues, or organelles. These types of regulatory elements are normally associated with genes that are expressed in a &#x201c;cell-specific&#x201d;, &#x201c;tissue-specific&#x201d;, or &#x201c;organelle-specific&#x201d; manner.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">An &#x201c;enhancer&#x201d; is a type of regulatory element that can increase the efficiency of transcription, regardless of the distance or orientation of the enhancer relative to the start site of transcription.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">&#x201c;Heterologous DNA&#x201d; refers to a DNA molecule, or a population of DNA molecules, that does not exist naturally within a given host cell. DNA molecules heterologous to a particular host cell may contain DNA derived from the host cell species (i.e., endogenous DNA) so long as that host DNA is combined with non-host DNA (i.e., exogenous DNA). For example, a DNA molecule containing a non-host DNA segment encoding a polypeptide operably linked to a host DNA segment comprising a transcription promoter is considered to be a heterologous DNA molecule. Conversely, a heterologous DNA molecule can comprise an endogenous gene operably linked with an exogenous promoter. As another illustration, a DNA molecule comprising a gene derived from a wild-type cell is considered to be heterologous DNA if that DNA molecule is introduced into a mutant cell that lacks the wild-type gene.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">An &#x201c;expression vector&#x201d; is a nucleic acid molecule encoding a gene that is expressed in a host cell. Typically, an expression vector comprises a transcription promoter, a gene, and a transcription terminator. Gene expression is usually placed under the control of a promoter, and such a gene is said to be &#x201c;operably linked to&#x201d; the promoter. Similarly, a regulatory element and a core promoter are operably linked if the regulatory element modulates the activity of the core promoter.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A &#x201c;recombinant host&#x201d; is a cell that contains a heterologous nucleic acid molecule, such as a cloning vector or expression vector. In the present context, an example of a recombinant host is a cell that produces an antagonist of the present invention from an expression vector. In contrast, such an antagonist can be produced by a cell that is a &#x201c;natural source&#x201d; of said antagonist, and that lacks an expression vector.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The terms &#x201c;amino-terminal&#x201d; and &#x201c;carboxyl-terminal&#x201d; are used herein to denote positions within polypeptides. Where the context allows, these terms are used with reference to a particular sequence or portion of a polypeptide to denote proximity or relative position. For example, a certain sequence positioned carboxyl-terminal to a reference sequence within a polypeptide is located proximal to the carboxyl terminus of the reference sequence, but is not necessarily at the carboxyl terminus of the complete polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A &#x201c;fusion protein&#x201d; is a hybrid protein expressed by a nucleic acid molecule comprising nucleotide sequences of at least two genes.

Such a fusion protein provides a means to isolate large quantities of IL-17A using affinity chromatography.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The term &#x201c;receptor&#x201d; denotes a cell-associated protein that binds to a bioactive molecule termed a &#x201c;ligand.&#x201d; This interaction mediates the effect of the ligand on the cell. Receptors can be membrane bound, cytosolic or nuclear; monomeric (e.g., thyroid stimulating hormone receptor, beta-adrenergic receptor) or multimeric (e.g., PDGF receptor, growth hormone receptor, IL-3 receptor, GM-CSF receptor, G-CSF receptor, erythropoietin receptor and IL-6 receptor). Membrane-bound receptors are characterized by a multi-domain structure comprising an extracellular ligand-binding domain and an intracellular effector domain that is typically involved in signal transduction. In certain membrane-bound receptors, the extracellular ligand-binding domain and the intracellular effector domain are located in separate polypeptides that comprise the complete functional receptor.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In general, the binding of ligand to receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor that causes an interaction between the effector domain and other molecule(s) in the cell, which in turn leads to an alteration in the metabolism of the cell. Metabolic events that are often linked to receptor-ligand interactions include gene transcription, phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, increases in cyclic AMP production, mobilization of cellular calcium, mobilization of membrane lipids, cell adhesion, hydrolysis of inositol lipids and hydrolysis of phospholipids.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The term &#x201c;expression&#x201d; refers to the biosynthesis of a gene product. For example, in the case of a structural gene, expression involves transcription of the structural gene into mRNA and the translation of mRNA into one or more polypeptides.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The term &#x201c;complement/anti-complement pair&#x201d; denotes non-identical moieties that form a non-covalently associated, stable pair under appropriate conditions. For instance, biotin and avidin (or streptavidin) are prototypical members of a complement/anti-complement pair. Other exemplary complement/anti-complement pairs include receptor/ligand pairs, antibody/antigen (or hapten or epitope) pairs, sense/antisense polynucleotide pairs, and the like. Where subsequent dissociation of the complement/anti-complement pair is desirable, the complement/anti-complement pair preferably has a binding affinity of less than 10<sup>9 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As used herein, a &#x201c;therapeutic agent&#x201d; is a molecule or atom which is conjugated to an antibody moiety to produce a conjugate which is useful for therapy.

The bispecific antibody, antibody or antigen-binding fragment made be administered with another pharmaceutical agent, for example an anti-inflammatory agent, either in the same formulation or separately.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In another embodiment, the present invention provides a composition comprising an antibody, e.g., a bispecific antibody, as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody, e.g., a bispecific antibody, of the invention can be formulated according to known methods to prepare pharmaceutically useful compositions, whereby the therapeutic proteins are combined in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A composition is said to be a &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; if its administration can be tolerated by a recipient patient. Sterile phosphate-buffered saline is one example of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Other suitable carriers are well-known to those in the art. See, for example, Gennaro, ed., <i>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, </i>19th Edition, Mack Publishing Company (1995).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">For pharmaceutical use, an antibody, e.g., a bispecific antibody, of the present invention are formulated for parenteral, particularly intravenous or subcutaneous, delivery according to conventional methods. Intravenous administration may be by bolus injection, controlled release, e.g., using mini-pumps or other appropriate technology, or by infusion over a typical period of one to several hours. In general, pharmaceutical formulations will include an antibody, e.g., a bispecific antibody, of the invention in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as saline, buffered saline, 5% dextrose in water or the like. Formulations may further include one or more excipients, preservatives, solubilizers, buffering agents, albumin to prevent protein loss on vial surfaces, etc. When utilizing such a combination therapy, the antibodies, which include bispecific antibodies, may be combined in a single formulation or may be administered in separate formulations. Methods of formulation are well known in the art and are disclosed, for example, in Gennaro, ed., <i>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences</i>, Mack Publishing Co., Easton Pa. (1990), which is incorporated herein by reference. Therapeutic doses will generally be in the range of 0.1 to 100 mg/kg of patient weight per day, preferably 0.5-20 mg/kg per day, with the exact dose determined by the clinician according to accepted standards, taking into account the nature and severity of the condition to be treated, patient traits, etc. Determination of dose is within the level of ordinary skill in the art. More commonly, the antibodies will be administered over one week or less, often over a period of one to three days. Generally, the dosage of administered antibodies will vary depending upon such factors as the patient's age, weight, height, sex, general medical condition and previous medical history. Typically, it is desirable to provide the recipient with a dosage of antibodies which is in the range of from about 1 pg/kg to 10 mg/kg (amount of agent/body weight of patient), although a lower or higher dosage also may be administered as circumstances dictate.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Administration of an antibody, e.g., bispecific antibody, of the invention to a subject can be intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intrapleural, intrathecal, by perfusion through a regional catheter, or by direct intralesional injection. When administering therapeutic antibodies by injection, the administration may be by continuous infusion or by single or multiple boluses.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Additional routes of administration include oral, mucosal-membrane, pulmonary, and transcutaneous. Oral delivery is suitable for polyester microspheres, zein microspheres, proteinoid microspheres, polycyanoacrylate microspheres, and lipid-based systems (see, for example, DiBase et al., &#x201c;Oral Delivery of Microencapsulated Proteins&#x201d;, in Sanders et al., eds., <i>Protein Delivery: Physical Systems</i>, pp. 255-288, Plenum Press (1997)). The feasibility of an intranasal delivery is exemplified by such a mode of insulin administration (see, for example, Hinchcliffe et al., <i>Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev., </i>35:199 (1999)). Dry or liquid particles comprising antibodies of the invention can be prepared and inhaled with the aid of dry-powder dispersers, liquid aerosol generators, or nebulizers (e.g., Pettit et al., <i>TIBTECH, </i>16:343 (1998); Patton et al., <i>Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev., </i>35:235 (1999)). This approach is illustrated by the AERX&#xae; diabetes management system, which is a hand-held electronic inhaler that delivers aerosolized insulin into the lungs. Studies have shown that proteins as large as 48,000 kDa have been delivered across skin at therapeutic concentrations with the aid of low-frequency ultrasound, which illustrates the feasibility of trascutaneous administration (Mitragotri et al., <i>Science, </i>269:850 (1995)). Transdermal delivery using electroporation provides another means to administer a molecule having IL-17 and IL-23/p19 binding activity (Potts et al., <i>Pharm. Biotechnol., </i>10:213 (1997)).</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">For purposes of therapy, compositions comprising an antibody, e.g., a bispecific antibody, of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are administered to a patient in a therapeutically effective amount. A combination of an antibody, e.g., a bispecific antibody, of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is said to be administered in a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; if the amount administered is physiologically significant. An agent is physiologically significant if its presence results in a detectable change in the physiology of a recipient patient. For example, an agent used to treat inflammation is physiologically significant if its presence alleviates the inflammatory response. Effective treatment may be assessed in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, effective treatment is determined by reduced inflammation. In other embodiments, effective treatment is marked by inhibition of inflammation. In still other embodiments, effective therapy is measured by increased well-being of the patient including such signs as weight gain, regained strength, decreased pain, thriving, and subjective indications from the patient of better health.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">A pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody, e.g., a bispecific antibody, of the invention can be furnished in liquid form, in an aerosol, or in solid form. Liquid forms, are illustrated by injectable solutions and oral suspensions. Exemplary solid forms include capsules, tablets, and controlled-release forms. The latter form is illustrated by miniosmotic pumps and implants (Bremer et al., <i>Pharm. Biotechnol., </i>10:239 (1997); Ranade, &#x201c;Implants in Drug Delivery&#x201d;, in Ranade et al., eds., <i>Drug Delivery Systems</i>, pp. 95-123, CRC Press (1995); Bremer et al., &#x201c;Protein Delivery with Infusion Pumps&#x201d;, in Sanders et al., eds., <i>Protein Delivery: Physical Systems</i>, pp. 239-254, Plenum Press (1997); Yewey et al., &#x201c;Delivery of Proteins from a Controlled Release Injectable Implant&#x201d;, in Sanders et al., eds., <i>Protein Delivery: Physical Systems</i>, pp. 93-117, Plenum Press (1997).</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Liposomes provide one means to deliver therapeutic polypeptides to a subject intravenously, intraperitoneally, intrathecally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or via oral administration, inhalation, or intranasal administration. Liposomes are microscopic vesicles that consist of one or more lipid bilayers surrounding aqueous compartments (see, generally, Bakker-Woudenberg et al., <i>Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis., </i>12(Suppl. 1):561 (1993), Kim, <i>Drugs, </i>46:618 (1993), and Ranade, &#x201c;Site-Specific Drug Delivery Using Liposomes as Carriers&#x201d;, in Ranade et al., eds., <i>Drug Delivery Systems</i>, pp. 3-24, CRC Press (1995)). Liposomes are similar in composition to cellular membranes and as a result, liposomes can be administered safely and are biodegradable. Depending on the method of preparation, liposomes may be unilamellar or multilamellar, and liposomes can vary in size with diameters ranging from 0.02 &#x3bc;m to greater than 10 &#x3bc;m. A variety of agents can be encapsulated in liposomes: hydrophobic agents partition in the bilayers and hydrophilic agents partition within the inner aqueous space(s) (see, for example, Machy et al., <i>Liposomes in Cell Biology and Pharmacology</i>, John Libbey (1987), and Ostro et al., <i>American J. Hosp. Pharm., </i>46:1576 (1989)). Moreover, it is possible to control the therapeutic availability of the encapsulated agent by varying liposome size, the number of bilayers, lipid composition, as well as the charge and surface characteristics of the liposomes.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Liposomes can absorb to virtually any type of cell and then slowly release the encapsulated agent. Alternatively, an absorbed liposome may be endocytosed by cells that are phagocytic. Endocytosis is followed by intralysosomal degradation of liposomal lipids and release of the encapsulated agents (Scherphof et al., <i>Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., </i>446:368 (1985)). After intravenous administration, small liposomes (0.1 to 1.0 &#x3bc;m) are typically taken up by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, located principally in the liver and spleen, whereas liposomes larger than 3.0 &#x3bc;m are deposited in the lung. This preferential uptake of smaller liposomes by the cells of the reticuloendothelial system has been used to deliver chemotherapeutic agents to macrophages and to tumors of the liver.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The reticuloendothelial system can be circumvented by several methods including saturation with large doses of liposome particles, or selective macrophage inactivation by pharmacological means (Claassen et al., <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta, </i>802:428 (1984)). In addition, incorporation of glycolipid- or polyethelene glycol-derivatized phospholipids into liposome membranes has been shown to result in a significantly reduced uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (Allen et al., <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta, </i>1068:133 (1991); Allen et al., <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta, </i>1150:9 (1993)).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Liposomes can also be prepared to target particular cells or organs by varying phospholipid composition or by inserting receptors or ligands into the liposomes. For example, liposomes, prepared with a high content of a nonionic surfactant, have been used to target the liver (Hayakawa et al., Japanese Patent No. 04-244,018; Kato et al., <i>Biol. Pharm. Bull., </i>16:960 (1993)). These formulations were prepared by mixing soybean phospatidylcholine, &#x3b1;-tocopherol, and ethoxylated hydrogenated castor oil (HCO-60) in methanol, concentrating the mixture under vacuum, and then reconstituting the mixture with water. A liposomal formulation of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) with a soybean-derived sterylglucoside mixture (SG) and cholesterol (Ch) has also been shown to target the liver (Shimizu et al., <i>Biol. Pharm. Bull., </i>20:881 (1997)).</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Alternatively, various targeting ligands can be bound to the surface of the liposome, such as antibodies, antibody fragments, carbohydrates, vitamins, and transport proteins. For example, liposomes can be modified with branched type galactosyllipid derivatives to target asialoglycoprotein (galactose) receptors, which are exclusively expressed on the surface of liver cells (Kato et al., <i>Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst., </i>14:287 (1997); Murahashi et al., <i>Biol. Pharm. Bull., </i>20:259 (1997)). Similarly, Wu et al., <i>Hepatology, </i>27:772 (1998), have shown that labeling liposomes with asialofetuin led to a shortened liposome plasma half-life and greatly enhanced uptake of asialofetuin-labeled liposome by hepatocytes. On the other hand, hepatic accumulation of liposomes comprising branched type galactosyllipid derivatives can be inhibited by preinjection of asialofetuin (Murahashi et al., <i>Biol. Pharm. Bull., </i>20:259 (1997)). Polyaconitylated human serum albumin liposomes provide another approach for targeting liposomes to liver cells (Kamps et al., <i>Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA, </i>94:11681 (1997)). Moreover, Geho et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,603,044, describe a hepatocyte-directed liposome vesicle delivery system, which has specificity for hepatobiliary receptors associated with the specialized metabolic cells of the liver.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In a more general approach to tissue targeting, target cells are prelabeled with biotinylated antibodies specific for a ligand expressed by the target cell (Harasym et al., <i>Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev., </i>32:99 (1998)). After plasma elimination of free antibody, streptavidin-conjugated liposomes are administered. In another approach, targeting antibodies are directly attached to liposomes (Harasym et al., <i>Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev., </i>32:99 (1998)).</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Antibodies can be encapsulated within liposomes using standard techniques of protein microencapsulation (see, for example, Anderson et al., <i>Infect. Immun., </i>31:1099 (1981), Anderson et al., <i>Cancer Res., </i>50:1853 (1990), and Cohen et al., <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta, </i>1063:95 (1991), Alving et al. &#x201c;Preparation and Use of Liposomes in Immunological Studies&#x201d;, in Gregoriadis, ed., <i>Liposome Technology, </i>2nd Edition, Vol. III, p. 317, CRC Press (1993), Wassef et al., <i>Meth. Enzymol., </i>149:124 (1987)). As noted above, therapeutically useful liposomes may contain a variety of components. For example, liposomes may comprise lipid derivatives of poly(ethylene glycol) (Allen et al., <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta, </i>1150:9 (1993)).</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Degradable polymer microspheres have been designed to maintain high systemic levels of therapeutic proteins. Microspheres are prepared from degradable polymers such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG), polyanhydrides, poly (ortho esters), nonbiodegradable ethylvinyl acetate polymers, in which proteins are entrapped in the polymer (Gombotz et al., <i>Bioconjugate Chem., </i>6:332 (1995); Ranade, &#x201c;Role of Polymers in Drug Delivery&#x201d;, in Ranade et al., eds., <i>Drug Delivery Systems</i>, pp. 51-93, CRC Press (1995); Roskos et al., &#x201c;Degradable Controlled Release Systems Useful for Protein Delivery&#x201d;, in Sanders et al., eds., <i>Protein Delivery: Physical Systems</i>, pp. 45-92, Plenum Press (1997); Bartus et al., <i>Science, </i>281:1161 (1998); Putney et al., <i>Nature Biotechnology, </i>16:153 (1998); Putney, <i>Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., </i>2:548 (1998)). Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated nanospheres can also provide carriers for intravenous administration of therapeutic proteins (see, for example, Gref et al., <i>Pharm. Biotechnol., </i>10:167 (1996).</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The formulation can also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Alternatively, or in addition, the composition can comprise an agent that enhances its function, such as, for example, a cytotoxic agent, cytokine, chemotherapeutic agent, or growth-inhibitory agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In one embodiment, an antibody, e.g., a bispecific antibody, of the invention is administered in combination therapy, i.e., combined with other agents, e.g., therapeutic agents, that are useful for treating pathological conditions or disorders, such as autoimmune disorders and inflammatory diseases. The term &#x201c;in combination&#x201d; in this context means that the agents are given substantially contemporaneously, either simultaneously or sequentially. If given sequentially, at the onset of administration of the second compound, the first of the two compounds is preferably still detectable at effective concentrations at the site of treatment.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">For example, the combination therapy can include one or more an antibodies, e.g., bispecific antibodies, of the invention coformulated with, and/or coadministered with, one or more additional therapeutic agents, e.g., one or more cytokine and growth factor inhibitors, immunosuppressants, anti-inflammatory agents, metabolic inhibitors, enzyme inhibitors, and/or cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, as described in more detail below. Furthermore, one or more antibodies, e.g., bispecific antibodies, described herein may be used in combination with two or more of the therapeutic agents described herein. Such combination therapies may advantageously utilize lower dosages of the administered therapeutic agents, thus avoiding possible toxicities or complications associated with the various monotherapies.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Preferred therapeutic agents used in combination with an antibody, e.g., bispecific antibody, of the invention are those agents that interfere at different stages in an inflammatory response.

antibodies were evaluated for their binding affinity to human IL-17A, human IL-17A/F, and human IL-17F using surface plasmon resonance.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0171">Kinetic rate constants and equilibrium dissociation constants were measured for the interaction of the humanized anti-human IL-17A/F antibodies with human IL-17A, IL-17A/F, and IL-17F via surface plasmon resonance. The association rate constant (k<sub>a </sub>(M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>)) is a value that reflects the rate of the antigen-antibody complex formation. The dissociation rate constant (k<sub>d </sub>(s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>)) is a value that reflects the stability of this complex. By dividing the dissociation rate constant by the association rate constant (k<sub>d</sub>/k<sub>a</sub>) the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D </sub>(M)) is obtained. This value describes the binding affinity of the interaction. Antibodies with similar K<sub>D </sub>can have widely variable association and dissociation rate constants. Consequently, measuring both the k<sub>a </sub>and k<sub>d </sub>of antibodies helps to more uniquely describe the affinity of the antibody-antigen interaction.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0172">Binding kinetics and affinity studies were performed on a BIACORE&#xae; T100 system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods for the BIACORE&#xae; T100 were programmed using BIACORE&#xae; T100 Control Software, v 2.0. For these experiments, the humanized anti-human IL-17A/F antibodies were captured onto a CM4 sensor chip via either goat anti-human IgG Fc-gamma antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.) or goat anti-mouse IgG Fc-gamma antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Binding experiments with the IL-17 molecules were performed at 25&#xb0; C. in a buffer of 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% Surfactant P20 (GE Healthcare), 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0173">The capture antibody, goat anti-human IgG Fc-gamma, was diluted to concentration of 20 &#x3bc;g/mL in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, and then covalently immobilized to all four flow cells of a CM4 sensor chip using amine coupling chemistry (EDC:NHS). After immobilization of the antibody, the remaining active sites on the flow cell were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine. A capture antibody density of approximately 5000 RU was obtained. The humanized anti-human IL-17A/F antibodies were captured onto flow cell 2, 3, or 4 of the CM4 chip at a density ranging from 60-150 RU. Capture of the test antibodies to the immobilized surface was performed at a flow rate of 10 &#x3bc;L/min. The BIACORE&#xae; instrument measures the mass of protein bound to the sensor chip surface, and thus, capture of the test antibody was verified for each cycle. Serial dilutions of human IL-17A, IL-17A/F, or IL-17F (ZymoGenetics, A Bristol-Myers, Squibb Company, Seattle, Wash., USA) were prepared from 100 nM-0.032 nM (1:5 serial dilutions). The serial dilutions were injected over the surface and allowed to specifically bind to the test antibody captured on the sensor chip. Duplicate injections of each antigen concentration were performed with an association time of 7 minutes and dissociation time of 15 minutes. Kinetic binding studies were performed with a flow rate of 50 &#x3bc;L/min. In between cycles, the flow cell was washed with 20 mM hydrochloric acid to regenerate the surface. This wash step removed both the captured test antibody and any bound antigen from the immobilized antibody surface. The test antibody was subsequently captured again in the next cycle.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0174">Data was compiled using the BIACORE&#xae; T100 Evaluation software (version 2.0). Data was processed by subtracting reference flow cell and blank injections. Baseline stability was assessed to ensure that the regeneration step provided a consistent binding surface throughout the sequence of injections. Duplicate injection curves were checked for reproducibility. Based on the binding of the bivalent IL-17 molecules to a bivalent antibody, the bivalent analyte binding interaction model was determined to be appropriate for interactions with the IL-17 molecules. The bivalent analyte model is previously described in West, A. P. et al., <i>Biochemistry, </i>39:9698-9708 (2000); and West, A. P. et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>313:385-397 (2001). An affinity constant (K<sub>D1</sub>) under the bivalent analyte model may be calculated from the ratio of rate constants (k<sub>d1</sub>/k<sub>a1</sub>) as determined by surface plasmon resonance. The reference subtracted binding curves were globally fit to the appropriate binding model with a multiple Rmax and with the RI set to zero. The data fit well to the binding models with good agreement between the experimental and theoretical binding curves. The chit and standard errors associated the fits were low. There was no trending in the residuals.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Anti-Human IL-17A/F Humanization Panel Biacore Activity</heading><p id="p-0178" num="0175">The results of the binding

The coating density varied between 500 to 8000 Resonance Units (RUs). Antibodies that were to be binned were titrated serially (1:2 or 1:3) to 8 concentrations, from starting concentrations that ranged from 10 to 100 &#x3bc;g/mL in a 96-well ELISA plate. To each of the well, 10 nM of IL-23 antigen was added. The antibodies on plate were allowed to form a complex with antigen and reach equilibrium overnight at 4&#xb0; C. The complexes were injected over the CM5 chip at a flow rate of 20 &#x3bc;L/min for two minutes. The signal, as binding resonance units (RUs) at end of two minutes was noted. The antibody-antigen complex was able complete or not compete with the material that was coated on the chip. If the antibody in complex with antigen was able to compete with the material on chip, with increasing concentration of the antibody, the binding RU decreased and if it did not compete, the binding RU increased. Based on this observation, all anti-IL23 antibodies were binned according to their binding selectivities and competing abilities.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0000">Transgenic HCo12 J/K HUMAB&#xae; Mice from the Medarex Colonies in Milpitas, Calif.

The biAbFabL is a bispecific antibody which contains a whole antibody with a C-terminal Fab unit of the second arm of the bispecific attached via a linker (e.g., 10 mer G<sub>4</sub>S) and utilizes a common light chain (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The taFab is a bispecific antibody which contains a whole antibody with an N-terminal Fab unit of the second arm of the bispecific attached via a linker, such as (Gly<sub>4</sub>Ser<sub>1</sub>)<sub>x</sub>, wherein x is 1, 2 or 3, and the linker of SEQ ID NO:12. As with the heavy chain portion, there are two light chains for each arm of the bispecific attached via a linker, such as (Gly<sub>4</sub>Ser<sub>1</sub>)<sub>x</sub>, wherein x is 1, 2 or 3, and the linker of SEQ ID NO:12 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The Heterodimeric Fc is a bispecific antibody that resembles a traditional antibody, however, contains two different heavy chains which associate through an electrostatic complementarity association in the CH3 region. The Heterodimeric Fc utilizes a common light chain (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).

The association rate constant (k<sub>a </sub>(M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>)) is a value that reflects the rate of the antigen-antibody complex formation. The dissociation rate constant (k<sub>d </sub>(s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>)) is a value that reflects the stability of this complex. By dividing the dissociation rate constant by the association rate constant (k<sub>d</sub>/k<sub>a</sub>) the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D </sub>(M)) is obtained. This value describes the binding affinity of the interaction. Antibodies with similar K<sub>D </sub>can have widely variable association and dissociation rate constants. Consequently, measuring both the k<sub>a </sub>and k<sub>d </sub>of antibodies helps to more uniquely describe the affinity of the antibody-antigen interaction.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0216">Binding kinetics and affinity studies were performed on a BIACORE&#xae; T100 system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods for the BIACORE&#xae; T100 were programmed using BIACORE&#xae; T100 Control Software, v 2.0. For these experiments, the monoclonal and bispecific antibodies were captured onto a CM4 sensor chip via goat anti-human IgG Fc-gamma antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.). Binding experiments with the human IL-17 molecules were performed at 25&#xb0; C. in a buffer of 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% Surfactant P20 (GE Healthcare), 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Binding experiments with the IL-23/IL-12B heterodimer were performed at 25&#xb0; C. in a buffer of 10 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% Surfactant P20 (Biacore), 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0217">The capture antibody, goat anti-human IgG Fc-gamma, was diluted to concentration of 20 &#x3bc;g/mL in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, and then covalently immobilized to all four flow cells of a CM4 sensor chip using amine coupling chemistry (EDC:NHS). After immobilization of the antibody, the remaining active sites on the flow cell were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine. A capture antibody density of approximately 5000 RU was obtained. The anti-human IL-23/IL-17A/F antibodies were captured onto flow cell 2, 3, or 4 of the CM4 chip at a density ranging from 60-150 RU. Capture of the test antibodies to the immobilized surface was performed at a flow rate of 10 &#x3bc;L/min. The BIACORE&#xae; instrument measures the mass of protein bound to the sensor chip surface, and thus, capture of the test antibody was verified for each cycle. Serial dilutions of human recombinant IL-17A, IL-17A/F, or IL-17F (ZymoGenetics, A Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Seattle, Wash., USA) were prepared from 100 nM-0.032 nM (1:5 serial dilutions), while serial dilutions of human recombinant IL-23 (ZymoGenetics, A Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Seattle, Wash., USA) were prepared from 200 nM-0.064 nM (1:5 serial dilutions). The serial dilutions were injected over the surface and allowed to specifically bind to the test antibody captured on the sensor chip. Duplicate injections of each antigen concentration were performed with an association time of 7 minutes and dissociation time of 15 minutes. Kinetic binding studies were performed with a flow rate of 50 &#x3bc;L/min. In between cycles, the flow cell was washed with 20 mM hydrochloric acid to regenerate the surface. This wash step removed both the captured test antibody and any bound antigen from the immobilized antibody surface. The test antibody was subsequently captured again in the next cycle.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0218">Data was compiled using the BIACORE&#xae; T100 Evaluation software (version 2.0). Data was processed by subtracting reference flow cell and blank injections. Baseline stability was assessed to ensure that the regeneration step provided a consistent binding surface throughout the sequence of injections. Duplicate injection curves were checked for reproducibility. Based on the binding of the bivalent IL-17 molecules to a bivalent antibody, the bivalent analyte binding interaction model was determined to be appropriate for interactions with the IL-17 molecules. Based on the binding of the IL-23/IL-12B heterodimer to a bivalent antibody, the 1:1 binding interaction model was determined to be appropriate for interactions with the IL-23 molecule. The reference subtracted binding curves were globally fit to the appropriate binding model with a multiple Rmax and with the RI set to zero. The data fit well to the binding models with good agreement between the experimental and theoretical binding curves. The chit and standard errors associated the fits were low. There was no trending in the residuals.</p><heading id="h-0035" level="2">Anti Human IL-23/IL-17A/F Bispecific Antibodies Biacore Activity</heading><p id="p-0230" num="0219">The results of the binding experiments with human IL-17A, IL-17A/F, and IL-17F are shown in Tables 10, 11, and 12, respectively.

One of these downstream mediators is CXCL1 (also known as GRO-&#x3b1; in human, or KC in mice), a chemokine that has important neutrophil chemoattractant activity and plays a role in inflammation. The ability of anti-human IL23/17A/F bispecific antibodies (bAbs) to reduce IL-17A, F and AF-mediated increases in GRO-&#x3b1; in mice was evaluated in order to show that the bAbs would be efficacious against IL-17-induced activities in an in vivo setting and thus that the bAbs would be useful in treating human diseases in which IL-17A, F or AF play a role. However, because these bAbs do not cross react with mouse IL-17A, F or AF, it was necessary to deliver human (h) IL-17A, F or AF to mice to induce the production of GRO-&#x3b1; (or in the case of mice, induce the production of KC, which is the murine analogue of GRO-&#x3b1;) which could then be neutralized in the presence of the anti-human IL23/17A/F bAbs.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0230">For these experiments, female BALB/c mice (age 7-9 wk) were used. At time 18 hours, the mice received an intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of either the vehicle (PBS) or a dose of one of the anti-human IL-23/17A/F bAbs as shown in Table 14 and 15, in the left-hand column. At time 0, they received a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of one of the following recombinant human proteins: 0.175 mg/kg hIL-17A, 0.9 mg/kg hIL-17F or 0.5 mg/kg hIL-17AF. Control mice received a s.c. injection of the vehicle (PBS) instead of one of the hIL-17 proteins. Two hours later, the mice were bled via the retro-orbital sinus under isoflurane gas anesthesia, serum was collected following centrifugation of the blood, and the serum was then stored at 80&#xb0; C. until analyzed for serum KC concentrations using a commercial ELISA as per the manufacturer's instructions (Quantikine Mouse CXCL1/KC Immunoassay, R&#x26;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.).</p><p id="p-0246" num="0231">As shown in Table 14 and 15, mice treated with the bAbs showed a dose-dependent increase in the inhibition of hIL-17A, F or AF-induced serum KC (CXCL1) concentrations indicating that the bAbs were efficacious in reducing the activities mediated by these IL-17 ligands. CXCL1 is just one example of a biological readout in response to IL-17A, F or AF; there are numerous other important downstream readouts that also play a role in diseases in which IL-17A, F or AF play a role that could be used as endpoint measurement.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00014" num="00014"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0"

(Parker et al., &#x201c;MALDI/MS-based epitope mapping of antigens bound to immobilized antibodies&#x201d;, <i>Mol. Biotechnol., </i>20(1):49-62 (January 2002)). In both cases the IL-23p19 antibody was directly immobilized via primary amines of the antibody on surface-activated beads at an average density of 2 mg mAb per 1 ml bed volume. Peptides from IL-23 his-tag antigen were generated with or without reduction and alkylation. Reduction of the antigen IL-23 was performed by incubating with 50 mM dithiothreitol in PBS and 4M guanidine HCl for 1 hour at 37&#xb0; C. This was followed by alkylation with 100 mM iodoacetamide for 30 minutes at room temperature. Reduced and alkylated IL-23 was dialyzed against PBS overnight prior to fragmentation. For epitope extraction, antigen peptides were generated by proteolytic digestion with the endoproteinases trypsin, chymotrypsin, lys-C, arg-C, asp-N and or glu-C with an enzyme to antigen ratio of up to 2% (w/w). Incubations were performed at 37&#xb0; C. with incubation times ranging from 2 hours to overnight. The resulting peptides were mixed with antibody resin at room temperature for 30 minutes. This resin was then washed three times to remove any non-specifically bound peptides. All digestion, incubation, and wash steps were performed in PBS pH 7. The same protocol was followed for epitope excision except that the intact antigen was incubated with the antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to enzymatic digestion. In both methods antibody bound peptides were eluted and analyzed on ESI-MS.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0252">These data indicate that IL-23p19 antibody has a discontinuous epitope comprised of three peptide regions in IL-23p19.

The level of HDX depends on the solvent accessibility of backbone amide hydrogen atoms and the conformation of the protein. The mass increase of the protein upon HDX can be precisely measured by MS. When this technique is paired with enzymatic digestion, structural features at the peptide level can be resolved, enabling differentiation of surface exposed peptides from those folded inside. Typically, the deuterium labeling and subsequent quenching experiments are performed, followed by online pepsin digestion, peptide separation, and MS analysis. Prior to epitope mapping of BMS-986113 in IL-23 by HDX-MS, non-deuteriated experiments were performed to generate a list of common peptic peptides for IL-23 (4.4 mg/mL) and IL-23/BMS-986113 (1:1 molar ratio, 4.4 mg/mL &#x26; 3.36 mg/mL), achieving a sequence coverage of 97% for IL-23. In this experiment, 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was used during the labeling step, followed by adding quenching buffer (200 mM phosphate buffer with 1.5M GdnCl and 0.5M TCEP, pH 2.5, 1:1, v/v). For epitope mapping experiments, 5 &#x3bc;L of each sample (IL-23 or IL-23/BMS-986113 (1:1 molar ratio)) was mixed with 65 &#x3bc;L HDX labeling buffer (10 mM phosphate buffer in D<sub>2</sub>O, pD 7.0) to start the labeling reactions at room temperature (&#x2dc;25&#xb0; C.). The reactions were carried out for different periods of time: 20 sec, 1 min, 10 min, 60 min and 240 min. By the end of each labeling reaction period, the reaction was quenched by adding quenching buffer (1:1, v/v) and the quenched sample was injected into Waters HDX-MS system for analysis. The observed common peptic peptides were monitored for their deuterium uptake levels in the absence/presence of BMS-986113. The same protocol was followed for epitope mapping of anti-IL-23 7B7 Fab (4.91 mg/mL) in IL-23 by HDX-MS.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0254">Epitope mapping of anti-IL-23 7B7 Fab in complex with IL-23 and biAb3 with IL-23 indicate that biAb3 has a discontinuous epitope comprised of five peptide regions in IL-23p19.

A., &#x201c;Systemic mutational analyses of protein-protein interfaces&#x201d;, <i>Enzym., </i>202:390-411 (1991)). Multiple sources of information on the involvement of residues in a potential epitope with the 7B7 Fab and biAb3 were combined to produce a targeted list of regional alanine shave mutants. The residues contained in the overlapping regions between both the HDX (see above in this Example 7) and the proteolytic digest peptide mapping (see above in this Example 7) were mapped onto the sequence of the IL-23p19 domain and three linear regions of common residues were identified as Regions A, B and C. Region A corresponds to amino acid residues 33-59 of SEQ ID NO:6. Region B corresponds to amino acid residues 89-125 of SEQ ID NO:6. Region C corresponds to amino acid residues 144-173 of SEQ ID NO:6. In order to calculate the residues whose side chains are exposed (solvent accessible surface area, SASA) and would therefore be located on the protein surface of the p19 domain of IL-23, an in-house structure of the IL-23 heterodimer was used. For each residue in the p19 domain of IL-23 the ratio of accessible surface to the standard exposed surface for the amino acid type was calculated and residues were grouped into bins. Residues were placed in accessibility bins as follows: &#x3c;30%, 30-40%, 40-50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%, &#x3e;90% exposed. The standard residue accessibilities for each amino acid type were calculated in the extended tripeptide Gly-X-Gly. The second calculation performed was ODA (Optimal Docking Area) which is useful for predicting likely protein-protein interaction surfaces. The method identifies optimal surface patches with the lowest docking desolvation energy. The ODA was calculated for the p19 domain of IL-23 and these results used to prioritize residues for mutagenesis.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0256">Residues in these three regions (A, B, C) were prioritized based upon a high score in both the ODA and SASA calculations and also weighted based on the extent of hydrogen-deuterium exchange relative to the uncomplexed IL-23 (peptide #1&#x3e;#2&#x3e;#3&#x3e;#4&#x3e;#5). Regions with non-identity to mouse were cloned as mouse swap mutants, instead of alanine shave mutants, which did not show an impact on binding in small scale testing. With the exception of M7 which contains a linear sequence of residues in an extended loop, residues were then combined into non-linear epitopes based on mapping them to the X-ray crystallographic structure of IL-23 (M5, M6, M8). Additional backup mutants were generated with the sub-epitopes of predominantly linear residues (M9, M10, M11). The alanine shave mutants designed by this method are shown below in Table 27.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00029" num="00029"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 27</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Alanine Shave Mutants of IL-23p19</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="140pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>IL-23p19</entry></row><row><entry>Name</entry><entry>Region Mutated</entry><entry>(SEQ ID NO: 6) Residues Mutated to Alanine</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>M5</entry><entry>A and B</entry><entry>H53A, M54A, E112A, L116A and D118A</entry></row><row><entry>M6</entry><entry>A and C</entry><entry>T42A, W45A, H48A, F163A and Q170A</entry></row><row><entry>M7</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>W142A, E143A, T144A, Q145A and Q146A</entry></row><row><entry>M8</entry><entry>A, B and C</entry><entry>H53A, E112A, Q154A and W156A</entry></row><row><entry>M9</entry><entry>B</entry><entry>L116A, D118A and Q123A</entry></row><row><entry>M10</entry><entry>A</entry><entry>H53A, M54A, D55A and F163A</entry></row><row><entry>M11</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>W142A, T144A and Q146A</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0064" level="2">Cloning, Expression and Purification of IL-23 Epitope Mapping Alanine Mutants</heading><p id="p-0288" num="0257">Non-tagged wild-type IL-23 p40 subunit entry vector construct was generated by PCR and the fidelity of the PCR fragment was confirmed by sequencing.

IL-23 induction of phosphorylation of STAT3 was monitored by ELISA for IL-23 Alanine shave mutants. BaF3/huIL-23R&#x3b1;/huIL-12R&#x3b2;1 (clone 6) cells were washed three times with assay media before being plated at 50,000 cells per well in 96-well round-bottom tissue culture plates. BaF3/huIL-23R&#x3b1;/huIL-12R&#x3b2;1 cells respond to IL-23 in a dose dependant manner by phosphorylation of STAT3. To assess antibody inhibition of IL-23 signaling, an EC<sub>50 </sub>concentration of 20 pM IL-23 was premixed with three-fold serial dilutions of each antibody from 33 nM to 0.56 pM and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 15 minutes in assay media prior to addition to the cells. Following pre-incubation, treatments were added in duplicate to plates containing cells and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 15 minutes to stimulate phosphorylation of STAT3. Stimulation was stopped with the addition of ice-cold wash buffer and cells lysed according to manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad Laboratories Cell Lysis kit, Cat #171-304012).

A Wyatt Technology MINIDAWN&#x2122; TREOS&#xae; laser light scattering instrument was plumbed downstream from the HPLC, followed by a Wyatt OPTILAB&#xae; T-REX&#x2122; differential refractometer. Sixty (60) &#x3bc;g of each IL-23 sample was injected after filtering at a concentration of 10.3 &#x3bc;M. For complex formation, 60 &#x3bc;g of the 7B7 Fab was premixed with a 6% molar excess and incubated with the IL-23 protein at a concentration of 10.904 at room temperature for at 3-6 hours before chromatographic separation. Particulates were removed from protein samples with a spin filter (NANOSEP&#xae; MF, 0.2 &#x3bc;m, Pall Corporation) prior to injection. Data were analyzed with ASTRA&#xae; 6 (Wyatt) and Chemstation (Agilent). All mutants were mostly monomeric, similar to the wild-type. The M5 mutant did not show significant complex formation after pre-incubation with the Fab and eluted close to where the M5 IL-23 alone elutes demonstrating that little if any complex was formed in the 10 &#x3bc;M concentration range of this experiment. M7 complexed and eluted similar to the wild-type. The M9 and M10 mutants form complex at these concentrations, but the mass was somewhat less than that of the wild-type and the retention time was slightly later than the wild-type and M7, suggesting that their affinity for 7B7 was weaker than the wild-type and M7. SEC-MALS analysis of the 14 single alanine mutants showed that all were mostly monomeric, similar to the wild-type, and only the L116A mutant showed a late-shifted elution time and a slight reduction in the expected mass of the complex suggesting that the affinity of the IL-23 for the 7B7 Fab was reduced. These results are consistent with the Biacore shift in Kd for these L116A. The effect of the reduced affinity of the complex of D54A and M55A with the Fab was not able to be resolved under the conditions of this assay.</p><heading id="h-0068" level="2">Differential Scanning Calorimetry of IL-23 Mutants</heading><p id="p-0301" num="0266">The thermal stability profile for the wild type and mutant IL-23 heterodimers was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a MICROCAL&#xae; VP-capillary DSC instrument. 0.7 mg/ml protein samples in PBS (7 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 3 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 130 mM NaCl, pH 7.1) were scanned from 10-100&#xb0; C. at 90&#xb0;/hr, and the resulting thermograms were subjected to a buffer blank subtraction and fitting procedure.

Overall no significant difference in FT-IR spectrum and calculated secondary structure result was observed in the alanine shave mutants compared to the wild type IL-23.</p><heading id="h-0070" level="2">Circular Dichroism (CD) Analysis of IL-23 Mutants</heading><p id="p-0303" num="0268">Secondary structure comparison of the alanine shave mutants and wild type of IL-23 using CD spectroscopy was performed using a Jasco J-815 Spectrophotometer. The spectra were collected at 0.25 mg/mL IL-23 protein concentration in PBS pH7.1 using a 1 mm path length cells at 25&#xb0; C. from 300-190 nm with a data interval of 0.1 nm, a 50 nm/min scanning speed, a 1 nm bandwidth, and 2 accumulations. Overall no significant difference in secondary structure profile was observed in the alanine shave mutants compared to the wild type IL-23 using circular dichroism.</p><heading id="h-0071" level="2">Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis of IL-23 Mutants</heading><p id="p-0304" num="0269">Proton NMR is a highly sensitive technique that allows one to assess the conformational state at atomic detail. 1D <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra were acquired for each of four mutant (M5, M7, M9, M10) and wild type IL23 proteins. All proteins were dialyzed simultaneously against NMR buffer (PBS in 8% D20/92% H<sub>2</sub>O) to eliminate potential differences resulting from sample preparation. In addition, <sup>1</sup>H signal intensities were corrected for differences in protein concentration by normalizing to the wild type spectrum. All NMR data was collected at 32&#xb0; C. on a Bruker Avance 3 spectrometer operating at 600 MHz. 1D NMR spectra were acquired using the standard bruker pulse sequence (ZG) optimized for solvent and excipient suppression using the Watergate, WET, and Water flipback selective excitation pulse schemes. Two thousand forty-eight (2048) scans were signal averaged for each spectrum. Cosine squared apodization was applied prior to Fourier transformation, and a first order polynomial baseline correction was used to flatten the appearance of the baseline. Examination of each of the spectra for the individual proteins reveals that each mutant protein was properly folded, as evidenced by the well-dispersed resonances in both the high field (&#x3c;0.5 ppm) and low field (&#x3e;6.5 ppM) regions of the spectra. The high field methyl resonances indicated the presence of an intact hydrophobic core; the downfield amide protons reflected the existence of well-formed secondary structure (alpha helices and beta sheets). Comparison of the spectra with that for wild type IL23 indicated a very close match, precluding the existence of large conformational changes in the protein structure induced by the amino acid substitutions. In addition, the NMR results also indicated that extra loss in activity in MS is unlikely due to an extra large disruption in structural integrity at the mutation sites in MS. The fact that MS was considerably closer to the wild-type protein by principle component analysis than M9 suggests, that the following MS-mutations which are missing in M9, i.e., H53A, MS4A and E112A do not cause much of a disruption in the MS-structure. It was also observed that mutants M7 &#x26; M9 which contain the elimination of an aromatic residue appeared most similar to each other in the principle component analysis.</p><heading id="h-0072" level="2">Summary of IL-23 Epitope Analysis</heading><p id="p-0305" num="0270">The methods of Alanine Shave and Single Mutagenesis have been used to map the epitope of hIL-23 for the 7B7 Fab contained in both the 7B7 Fab, 7B7 antibody and biAb3. The targeted mutagenesis strategy was performed using epitope information generated by proteolytic digest LCMS analysis, peptide binding, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, solvent accessible surface area calculations and docking algorithm calculations. Small scale screening by SPR and scale-up of select purified mutants demonstrated a specific epitope for 7B7/biAb3 binding hIL-23. The MS mutant shows dramatic decrease in binding to 7B7/biAb3, while maintaining functional activity, binding to p40 and p19 specific reagents, monomeric oligomeric state, thermal stability, and secondary structural features similar to the wild-type. The MS mutant showed a dramatic loss of binding to 7B7/biAb3 while M9 &#x26; M10, which each contained two of the same mutated residues as MS, each show partial loss of binding to 7B7/biAb3. The affinity of the MS IL-23 mutant was &#x3e;300 nM for 7B7/biAb3 which is approximately 1,500-fold weaker than wild-type IL-23 demonstrating that the residues in the MS mutant define the epitope for 7B7/biAb3 binding to IL-23. Thus, the data suggests that the 7B7/biAb3 antibody binds to a discontinuous epitope on the p19 subunit of IL-23. This discontinuous epitope on IL-23p19 comprises at least two epitope regions (region A (amino acid residues 33-59 of SEQ ID NO:6) and region B (amino acid residues 89-125 of SEQ ID NO:6)). Specifically, with respect to the first epitope or region A of IL-23p19, amino acid residues 54 (Met) and 55 (Asp) of SEQ ID NO:6 contribute a significant amount of binding energy to 7B7/biAb3's ability to bind IL-23p19. With respect to the second epitope or region B of IL-23p19, amino acid residue 116 (Leu) is the primary residue within Region B energetically contributing to 7B7/biAb3's ability to bind IL-23p19.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0271">From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention.
