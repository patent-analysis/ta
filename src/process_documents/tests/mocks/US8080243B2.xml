More specifically, the invention relates to compositions comprising antagonist PCSK9 antibodies, peptides, and/or aptamers and methods of using these antibodies and/or peptides and/or aptamers as a medicament. The antagonist PCSK9 antibodies, peptides, and aptamers can be used therapeutically to lower LDL-cholesterol levels in blood, and can be used in the prevention and/or treatment of cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism disorders, including familial hypercholesterolemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and, more generally, cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Millions of people in the U.S. are at risk for heart disease and resulting cardiac events. CVD and underlying atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death among all demographic groups, despite the availability of therapies directed at its multiple risk factors. Atherosclerosis is a disease of the arteries and is responsible for coronary heart disease associated with many deaths in industrialized countries. Several risk factors for coronary heart disease have now been identified: dyslipidemias, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, poor diet, inactivity and stress. The most clinically relevant and common dyslipidemias are characterized by an increase in beta-lipoproteins (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL) with hypercholesterolemia in the absence or presence of hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson et al., 1967, N Engl J Med. 276:34-42, 94-103, 148-156, 215-225, and 273-281). There is a long-felt significant unmet need with respect to CVD with 60-70% of cardiovascular events, heart attacks and strokes occurring despite the treatment with statins (the current standard of care in atherosclerosis). Moreover, new guidelines suggest that even lower LDL levels should be achieved in order to protect high risk patients from premature CVD [National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), 2004].</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">PCSK9, also known as NARC-1, was identified as a protein with a genetic mutation in some forms of familial hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 is synthesized as a zymogen that undergoes autocatalytic processing at the motif LVFAQ in the endoplasmic reticulum. Population studies have shown that some PCSK9 mutations are &#x201c;gain-of-function&#x201d; and are found in individuals with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia, while other &#x201c;loss-of-function&#x201d; (LOF) mutations are linked with reduced plasma cholesterol. Morbidity and mortality studies in this group clearly demonstrated that reducing PCSK9 function significantly diminished the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Of significant importance to the treatment of CVD, a LOF mutation may sensitize humans to statins, allowing for efficacy at a lower dose (hence, improving risks associated with safety and tolerance) and potentially achieving lower plasma cholesterol levels than with current therapies.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">PCSK9 is secreted into the plasma predominantly by hepatocytes. Genetic modulation of PCSK9 in mice confirmed the ability of PCSK9 to regulate blood lipids, and suggested that it acts to down-regulate hepatic LDLR protein levels.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The mechanism by which, and the site at which, PCSK9 down-regulates LDLR protein has not been clearly established. When over-expressed, PCSK9 may act both within the hepatocyte and as a secreted ligand for LDLR. There is strong evidence that extracellular PCSK9 binds to cell surface LDLR and promotes LDLR degradation at an intracellular site. However, it is also possible that PCSK9 could interact with the LDLR when the two proteins are translated within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traffic through endosomal compartments towards the cell membrane. Maxwell et al., 2005, Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 16:167-172, showed that PCSK9-mediated LDLR endocytosis and degradation was not altered by proteosome inhibitors nor was it modulated by different classes of lysosomal and nonlysosomal proteases. Two naturally occurring familial hypercholesterolemia mutations, S127R and D129G, have been reported to be defective in autoprocessing and secretion as levels of these mutant proteins were greatly reduced or undetectable in the media of transfected cells. Yet these mutants demonstrated an enhanced ability to down-regulate LDLR, consistent with their identification in individuals with high plasma LDL (Homer et al., 2008, Atherosclerosis 196:659-666; Cameron et al., 2006 Human Molecular Genetics 15:1551-1558; Lambert et al., 2006, TRENDS in Endocrinology and Metabolism 17:79-81. Since these mutants apparently do not get secreted extracellularly, and yet do downregulate LDLR, this strongly suggests that an intracellular site of action is physiologically important.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">From the information available in the art, and prior to the present invention, it remained unclear whether the introduction of an antibody-, peptide-, or aptamer-based PCSK9 antagonist into the blood circulation to selectively antagonize extracellular PCSK9 would be effective to reduce hypercholesterolemia and the associated incidence of CVD and, if so, what properties of a PCSK9 antagonist are needed for such in vivo effectiveness.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This invention relates to antagonist antibodies, peptides, and aptamers that selectively interact with and inhibit PCSK9 function.

As used herein, the term encompasses not only intact polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, but also fragments thereof (such as Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, Fv), single chain (ScFv) and domain antibodies), and fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site. An antibody includes an antibody of any class, such as IgG, IgA, or IgM (or sub-class thereof), and the antibody need not be of any particular class. Depending on the antibody amino acid sequence of the constant domain of its heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0060">As used herein, &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally-occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. The modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler and Milstein, 1975, Nature 256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al., 1990, Nature 348:552-554, for example.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0061">As used herein, &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibody refers to forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies that are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains, or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Preferably, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, the humanized antibody may comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences, but are included to further refine and optimize antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region or domain (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Preferred are antibodies having Fc regions modified as described in WO 99/58572. Other forms of humanized antibodies have one or more CDRs (CDR L1, CDR L2, CDR L3, CDR H1, CDR H2, and/or CDR H3) which are altered with respect to the original antibody, which are also termed one or more CDRs &#x201c;derived from&#x201d; one or more CDRs from the original antibody.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0062">As used herein, &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d; means an antibody having an amino acid sequence corresponding to that of an antibody that can be produced by a human and/or which has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies known to those skilled in the art or disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody includes antibodies comprising at least one human heavy chain polypeptide or at least one human light chain polypeptide. One such example is an antibody comprising murine light chain and human heavy chain polypeptides. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, the human antibody is selected from a phage library, where that phage library expresses human antibodies (Vaughan et al., 1996, Nature Biotechnology, 14:309-314; Sheets et al., 1998, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 95:6157-6162; Hoogenboom and Winter, 1991, J. Mol. Biol., 227:381; Marks et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol., 222:581). Human antibodies can also be made by immunization of animals into which human immunoglobulin loci have been transgenically introduced in place of the endogenous loci, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. This approach is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; and 5,661,016. Alternatively, the human antibody may be prepared by immortalizing human B lymphocytes that produce an antibody directed against a target antigen (such B lymphocytes may be recovered from an individual or may have been immunized in vitro). See, e.g., Cole et al. Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77, 1985; Boerner et al., 1991, J. Immunol., 147 (1):86-95; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,373.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0063">A &#x201c;variable region&#x201d; of an antibody refers to the variable region of the antibody light chain or the variable region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination. As known in the art, the variable regions of the heavy and light chain each consist of four framework regions (FR) connected by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) that contain hypervariable regions. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies. There are at least two techniques for determining CDRs: (1) an approach based on cross-species sequence variability (i.e., Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, (5th ed., 1991, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Md.)); and (2) an approach based on crystallographic studies of antigen-antibody complexes (Al-lazikani et al, 1997, J. Molec. Biol. 273:927-948). As used herein, a CDR may refer to CDRs defined by either approach or by a combination of both approaches.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0064">As known in the art a &#x201c;constant region&#x201d; of an antibody refers to the constant region of the antibody light chain or the constant region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0065">As used herein, the term &#x201c;PCSK9&#x201d; refers to any form of PCSK9 and variants thereof that retain at least part of the activity of PCSK9. Unless indicated differently, such as by specific reference to human PCSK9, PCSK9 includes all mammalian species of native sequence PCSK9, e.g., human, canine, feline, equine, and bovine. One exemplary human PCSK9 is found as Uniprot Accession Number Q8NBP7 (SEQ ID NO:16).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0066">As used herein, a &#x201c;PCSK9 antagonist&#x201d; refers to an antibody, peptide, or aptamer that is able to inhibit PCSK9 biological activity and/or downstream pathway(s) mediated by PCSK9 signaling, including PCSK9-mediated down-regulation of the LDLR, and PCSK9-mediated decrease in LDL blood clearance. A PCSK9 antagonist antibody encompasses antibodies that block, antagonize, suppress or reduce (to any degree including significantly) PCSK9 biological activity, including downstream pathways mediated by PCSK9 signaling, such as LDLR interaction and/or elicitation of a cellular response to PCSK9. For purpose of the present invention, it will be explicitly understood that the term &#x201c;PCSK9 antagonist antibody&#x201d; encompasses all the previously identified terms, titles, and functional states and characteristics whereby the PCSK9 itself, a PCSK9 biological activity (including but not limited to its ability to mediate any aspect of interaction with the LDLR, down regulation of LDLR, and decreased blood LDL clearance), or the consequences of the biological activity, are substantially nullified, decreased, or neutralized in any meaningful degree. In some embodiments, a PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds PCSK9 and prevents interaction with the LDLR. Examples of PCSK9 antagonist antibodies are provided herein.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0067">As used herein a &#x201c;full antagonist&#x201d; is an antagonist which, at an effective concentration, essentially completely blocks a measurable effect of PCSK9. By a partial antagonist is meant an antagonist that is capable of partially blocking a measurable effect, but that, even at a highest concentration is not a full antagonist. By essentially completely is meant at least about 80%, preferably, at least about 90%, more preferably, at least about 95%, and most preferably, at least about 98% or 99% of the measurable effect is blocked. The relevant &#x201c;measurable effects&#x201d; are described herein and include down regulation of LDLR by a PCSK9 antagonist as assayed in Huh7 cells in vitro, in vivo decrease in blood (or plasma) levels of total cholesterol, and in vivo decrease in LDL levels in blood (or plasma).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0068">As used herein, the term &#x201c;clinically meaningful&#x201d; means at least a 15% reduction in blood LDL-cholesterol levels in humans or at least a 15% reduction in total blood cholesterol in mice. It is clear that measurements in plasma or serum can serve as surrogates for measurement of levels in blood.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0069">As used herein, the term &#x201c;PCSK9 antagonist peptide&#x201d; or &#x201c;PCSK9 antagonist aptamer&#x201d; includes any conventional peptide or polypeptide or aptamer that blocks, antagonizes, suppresses or reduces (to any degree including significantly) PCSK9 biological activity, including downstream pathways mediated by PCSK9 signaling, such as LDLR interaction and/or elicitation of a cellular response to PCSK9. PCSK9 antagonist peptides or polypeptides include Fc fusions comprising the LDLR and soluble portions of the LDLR, or mutants thereof with higher affinity to PCSK9.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0070">The terms &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d;, &#x201c;oligopeptide&#x201d;, &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein to refer to chains of amino acids of any length, preferably, relatively short (e.g., 10-100 amino acids). The chain may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and/or may be interrupted by non-amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid chain that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling component. Also included within the definition are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino acids, etc.), as well as other modifications known in the art. It is understood that the polypeptides can occur as single chains or associated chains.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0071">As known in the art, &#x201c;polynucleotide,&#x201d; or &#x201c;nucleic acid,&#x201d; as used interchangeably herein, refer to chains of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a chain by DNA or RNA polymerase. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the chain. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after polymerization, such as by conjugation with a labeling component. Other types of modifications include, for example, &#x201c;caps&#x201d;, substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, poly-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid supports. The 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2&#x2032;-O-methyl-, 2&#x2032;-O-allyl, 2&#x2032;-fluoro- or 2&#x2032;-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, alpha- or beta-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and abasic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S(&#x201c;thioate&#x201d;), P(S)S (&#x201c;dithioate&#x201d;), (O)NR<sub>2 </sub>(&#x201c;amidate&#x201d;), P(O)R, P(O)OR&#x2032;, CO or CH<sub>2 </sub>(&#x201c;formacetal&#x201d;), in which each R or R&#x2032; is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (&#x2014;O&#x2014;) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0072">A &#x201c;PCSK9 antagonist aptamer,&#x201d; which comprises a nucleic acid or protein sequence, is, for example, selected from a large pool of random sequences and specifically binds PCSK9. The nucleic acid of the aptamer is double-stranded DNA or single-strand RNA. Nucleic acid aptamers can include modified bases or functional groups, including but not limited to 2&#x2032;-fluorine nucleotides and 2&#x2032;-O-methyl nucleotides. Aptamers can include hydrophilic polymers, for example, polyethylene glycol. Aptamers may be made by methods known in the art and selected for PCSK9 antagonist activity by routine modification of the methods disclosed in the Examples.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0073">As used herein, an antibody, peptide, or aptamer &#x201c;interacts with&#x201d; PCSK9 when the equilibrium dissociation constant is equal to or less than 20 nM, preferably less than about 6 nM, more preferably less than about 1 nM, most preferably less than about 0.2 nM, as measured by the methods disclosed herein in Example 2.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0074">An epitope that &#x201c;preferentially binds&#x201d; or &#x201c;specifically binds&#x201d; (used interchangeably herein) to an antibody or a polypeptide is a term well understood in the art, and methods to determine such specific or preferential binding are also well known in the art. A molecule is said to exhibit &#x201c;specific binding&#x201d; or &#x201c;preferential binding&#x201d; if it reacts or associates more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration and/or with greater affinity with a particular cell or substance than it does with alternative cells or substances. An antibody &#x201c;specifically binds&#x201d; or &#x201c;preferentially binds&#x201d; to a target if it binds with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other substances. For example, an antibody that specifically or preferentially binds to a PCSK9 epitope is an antibody that binds this epitope with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other PCSK9 epitopes or non-PCSK9 epitopes. It is also understood by reading this definition that, for example, an antibody (or moiety or epitope) that specifically or preferentially binds to a first target may or may not specifically or preferentially bind to a second target. As such, &#x201c;specific binding&#x201d; or &#x201c;preferential binding&#x201d; does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding. Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means preferential binding.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0075">As used herein, &#x201c;substantially pure&#x201d; refers to material which is at least 50% pure (i.e., free from contaminants), more preferably, at least 90% pure, more preferably, at least 95% pure, yet more preferably, at least 98% pure, and most preferably, at least 99% pure.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0076">A &#x201c;host cell&#x201d; includes an individual cell or cell culture that can be or has been a recipient for vector(s) for incorporation of polynucleotide inserts. Host cells include progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be completely identical (in morphology or in genomic DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation. A host cell includes cells transfected in vivo with a polynucleotide(s) of this invention.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0077">As known in the art, the term &#x201c;Fc region&#x201d; is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. The &#x201c;Fc region&#x201d; may be a native sequence Fc region or a variant Fc region. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The numbering of the residues in the Fc region is that of the EU index as in Kabat. Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1991. The Fc region of an immunoglobulin generally comprises two constant domains, CH2 and CH3.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0078">As used in the art, &#x201c;Fc receptor&#x201d; and &#x201c;FcR&#x201d; describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the Fc&#x3b3;RI, Fc&#x3b3;RII, and Fc&#x3b3;RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc&#x3b3;RII receptors include Fc&#x3b3;RIIA (an &#x201c;activating receptor&#x201d;) and Fc&#x3b3;RIIB (an &#x201c;inhibiting receptor&#x201d;), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, 1991, Ann. Rev. Immunol., 9:457-92; Capel et al., 1994, Immunomethods, 4:25-34; and de Haas et al., 1995, J. Lab. Clin. Med., 126:330-41. &#x201c;FcR&#x201d; also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., 1976 J. Immunol., 117:587; and Kim et al., 1994, J. Immunol., 24:249).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0079">The term &#x201c;compete&#x201d;, as used herein with regard to an antibody, means that a first antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, binds to an epitope in a manner sufficiently similar to the binding of a second antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, such that the result of binding of the first antibody with its cognate epitope is detectably decreased in the presence of the second antibody compared to the binding of the first antibody in the absence of the second antibody. The alternative, where the binding of the second antibody to its epitope is also detectably decreased in the presence of the first antibody, can, but need not be the case. That is, a first antibody can inhibit the binding of a second antibody to its epitope without that second antibody inhibiting the binding of the first antibody to its respective epitope. However, where each antibody detectably inhibits the binding of the other antibody with its cognate epitope or ligand, whether to the same, greater, or lesser extent, the antibodies are said to &#x201c;cross-compete&#x201d; with each other for binding of their respective epitope(s). Both competing and cross-competing antibodies are encompassed by the present invention. Regardless of the mechanism by which such competition or cross-competition occurs (e.g., steric hindrance, conformational change, or binding to a common epitope, or portion thereof), the skilled artisan would appreciate, based upon the teachings provided herein, that such competing and/or cross-competing antibodies are encompassed and can be useful for the methods disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0080">By an antibody with an epitope that &#x201c;overlaps&#x201d; with another (second) epitope or with a surface on PCSK9 that interacts with the EGF-like domain of the LDLR is meant the sharing of space in terms of the PCSK9 residues that are interacted with. To calculate the percent of overlap, for example, the percent overlap of the claimed antibody's PCSK9 epitope with the surface of PCSK9 which interacts with the EGF-like domain of the LDLR, the surface area of PCSK9 buried when in complex with the LDLR is calculated on a per-residue basis. The buried area is also calculated for these residues in the PCSK9:antibody complex. To prevent more than 100% possible overlap, surface area for residues that have higher buried surface area in the PCSK9:antibody complex than in LDLR:PCSK9 complex is set to values from the LDLR:PCSK9 complex (100%). Percent surface overlap is calculated by summing over all of the LDLR:PCSK9 interacting residues and is weighted by the interaction area.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0081">A &#x201c;functional Fc region&#x201d; possesses at least one effector function of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary &#x201c;effector functions&#x201d; include Clq binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; phagocytosis; down-regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g., B cell receptor), etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain (e.g., an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various assays known in the art for evaluating such antibody effector functions.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0082">A &#x201c;native sequence Fc region&#x201d; comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. A &#x201c;variant Fc region&#x201d; comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification, yet retains at least one effector function of the native sequence Fc region. Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, e.g., from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably, from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80% sequence identity with a native sequence Fc region and/or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide, and most preferably, at least about 90% sequence identity therewith, more preferably, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99% sequence identity therewith.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0083">As used herein, &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired clinical results. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: enhancement of LDL clearance and reducing incidence or amelioration of aberrant cholesterol and/or lipoprotein levels resulting from metabolic and/or eating disorders, or including familial hypercholesterolemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and, more generally, cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0084">&#x201c;Reducing incidence&#x201d; means any of reducing severity (which can include reducing need for and/or amount of (e.g., exposure to) other drugs and/or therapies generally used for this condition. As is understood by those skilled in the art, individuals may vary in terms of their response to treatment, and, as such, for example, a &#x201c;method of reducing incidence&#x201d; reflects administering the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer based on a reasonable expectation that such administration may likely cause such a reduction in incidence in that particular individual.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0085">&#x201c;Ameliorating&#x201d; means a lessening or improvement of one or more symptoms as compared to not administering a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer. &#x201c;Ameliorating&#x201d; also includes shortening or reduction in duration of a symptom.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0086">As used herein, an &#x201c;effective dosage&#x201d; or &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to effect any one or more beneficial or desired results. For prophylactic use, beneficial or desired results include eliminating or reducing the risk, lessening the severity, or delaying the outset of the disease, including biochemical, histological and/or behavioral symptoms of the disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease. For therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results include clinical results such as reducing hypercholesterolemia or one or more symptoms of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, CVD, or coronary heart disease, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease, enhancing the effect of another medication, and/or delaying the progression of the disease of patients. An effective dosage can be administered in one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective dosage of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to accomplish prophylactic or therapeutic treatment either directly or indirectly. As is understood in the clinical context, an effective dosage of a drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or may not be achieved in conjunction with another drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an &#x201c;effective dosage&#x201d; may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable result may be or is achieved.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0087">An &#x201c;individual&#x201d; or a &#x201c;subject&#x201d; is a mammal, more preferably, a human.

In some embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer may be administered neat. In some embodiments, PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient may be in various formulations. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are known in the art, and are relatively inert substances that facilitate administration of a pharmacologically effective substance. For example, an excipient can give form or consistency, or act as a diluent. Suitable excipients include but are not limited to stabilizing agents, wetting and emulsifying agents, salts for varying osmolarity, encapsulating agents, buffers, and skin penetration enhancers. Excipients as well as formulations for parenteral and nonparenteral drug delivery are set forth in Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Ed., Mack Publishing (2000).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0101">These agents can be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles such as saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, and the like. The particular dosage regimen, i.e., dose, timing and repetition, will depend on the particular individual and that individual's medical history.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0102">PCSK9 antibodies can also be administered via inhalation, as described herein. Generally, for administration of PCSK9 antibodies, an initial candidate dosage can be about 2 mg/kg. For the purpose of the present invention, a typical daily dosage might range from about any of about 3 &#x3bc;g/kg to 30 &#x3bc;g/kg to 300 &#x3bc;g/kg to 3 mg/kg, to 30 mg/kg, to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For example, dosage of about 1 mg/kg, about 2.5 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg, about 10 mg/kg, and about 25 mg/kg may be used. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of symptoms occurs or until sufficient therapeutic levels are achieved, for example, to reduce blood LDL levels. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial dose of about 2 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 1 mg/kg of the PCSK9 antibody, or followed by a maintenance dose of about 1 mg/kg every other week. However, other dosage regimens may be useful, depending on the pattern of pharmacokinetic decay that the practitioner wishes to achieve. For example, in some embodiments, dosing from one to four times a week is contemplated. In other embodiments dosing once a month or once every other month or every three months is contemplated. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays. The dosing regimen (including the PCSK9 antagonist(s) used) can vary over time.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0103">For the purpose of the present invention, the appropriate dosage of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer will depend on the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer (or compositions thereof) employed, the type and severity of symptoms to be treated, whether the agent is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the agent, the patient's blood PCSK9 levels, the patient's synthesis and clearance rate for PCSK9, the patient's clearance rate for the administered agent, and the discretion of the attending physician. Typically the clinician will administer a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired result. Dose and/or frequency can vary over course of treatment. Empirical considerations, such as the half-life, generally will contribute to the determination of the dosage. For example, antibodies that are compatible with the human immune system, such as humanized antibodies or fully human antibodies, may be used to prolong half-life of the antibody and to prevent the antibody being attacked by the host's immune system. Frequency of administration may be determined and adjusted over the course of therapy, and is generally, but not necessarily, based on treatment and/or suppression and/or amelioration and/or delay of symptoms, e.g., hypercholesterolemia. Alternatively, sustained continuous release formulations of PCSK9 antagonist antibodies may be appropriate.

Generally, those PCSK9 antagonist antibodies or peptides may have complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. A PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer can also be used in conjunction with other PCSK9 antagonists or PCSK9 receptor antagonists. For example, one or more of the following PCSK9 antagonists may be used: an antisense molecule directed to a PCSK9 (including an anti-sense molecule directed to a nucleic acid encoding PCSK9), a PCSK9 inhibitory compound, and a PCSK9 structural analog. A PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer can also be used in conjunction with other agents that serve to enhance and/or complement the effectiveness of the agents.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0107">Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and may comprise buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; salts such as sodium chloride; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens, such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN&#x2122;, PLURONICS&#x2122; or polyethylene glycol (PEG).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0108">Liposomes containing the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein, et al., 1985, Proc.

To obtain monofunctional Fab fragments, an antibody (for example, IgG) can be cleaved with papain or expressed recombinantly. The affinity of a PCSK9 Fab fragment of an antibody can be determined by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore3000&#x2122; surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system, Biacore, INC, Piscataway N.J.) equipped with pre-immobilized streptavidin sensor chips (SA) using HBS-EP running buffer (0.01M HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20). Biotinylated human PCSK9 (or any other PCSK9) can be diluted into HBS-EP buffer to a concentration of less than 0.5 &#x3bc;g/mL and injected across the individual chip channels using variable contact times, to achieve two ranges of antigen density, either 50-200 response units (RU) for detailed kinetic studies or 800-1,000 RU for screening assays. Regeneration studies have shown that 25 mM NaOH in 25% v/v ethanol effectively removes the bound Fab while keeping the activity of PCSK9 on the chip for over 200 injections. Typically, serial dilutions (spanning concentrations of 0.1-10&#xd7; estimated K<sub>D</sub>) of purified Fab samples are injected for 1 min at 100 &#x3bc;L/minute and dissociation times of up to 2 hours are allowed. The concentrations of the Fab proteins are determined by ELISA and/or SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using a Fab of known concentration (as determined by amino acid analysis) as a standard. Kinetic association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are obtained simultaneously by fitting the data globally to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (Karlsson, R. Roos, H. Fagerstam, L. Petersson, B., 1994. Methods Enzymology 6. 99-110) using the BIAevaluation program. Equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) values are calculated as k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. This protocol is suitable for use in determining binding affinity of an antibody to any PCSK9, including human PCSK9, PCSK9 of another mammalian (such as mouse PCSK9, rat PCSK9, primate PCSK9), as well as different forms of PCSK9 (such as &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; form).

Available myeloma lines, including but not limited to X63-Ag8.653 and those from the Salk Institute, Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif., USA, may be used in the hybridization. Generally, the technique involves fusing myeloma cells and lymphoid cells using a fusogen such as polyethylene glycol, or by electrical means well known to those skilled in the art. After the fusion, the cells are separated from the fusion medium and grown in a selective growth medium, such as hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) medium, to eliminate unhybridized parent cells. Any of the media described herein, supplemented with or without serum, can be used for culturing hybridomas that secrete monoclonal antibodies. As another alternative to the cell fusion technique, EBV immortalized B cells may be used to produce the PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies of the subject invention. The hybridomas are expanded and subcloned, if desired, and supernatants are assayed for anti-immunogen activity by conventional immunoassay procedures (e.g., radioimmunoassay, enzyme immunoassay, or fluorescence immunoassay).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0127">Hybridomas that may be used as a source of antibodies encompass all derivatives, progeny cells of the parent hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies specific for PCSK9, or a portion thereof.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0128">Hybridomas that produce such antibodies may be grown in vitro or in vivo using known procedures.

Undesired activity, if present, can be removed, for example, by running the preparation over adsorbents made of the immunogen attached to a solid phase and eluting or releasing the desired antibodies off the immunogen. Immunization of a host animal with a human PCSK9, or a fragment containing the target amino acid sequence conjugated to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, e.g., keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride, SOCl<sub>2</sub>, or R<sup>1</sup>N&#x2550;C&#x2550;NR, where R and R<sup>1 </sup>are different alkyl groups, can yield a population of antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies).</p><p id="p-0126" num="0129">If desired, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody (monoclonal or polyclonal) of interest may be sequenced and the polynucleotide sequence may then be cloned into a vector for expression or propagation.

Production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies in cell culture can be carried out through cloning of antibody genes from B cells by means known in the art. See, e.g., Tiller et al., 2008, J.

It may be desirable to genetically manipulate the antibody sequence to obtain greater affinity to PCSK9 and greater efficacy in inhibiting PCSK9. It will be apparent to one of skill in the art that one or more polynucleotide changes can be made to the PCSK9 antagonist antibody and still maintain its binding ability to PCSK9.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0131">There are four general steps to humanize a monoclonal antibody. These are: (1) determining the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of the starting antibody light and heavy variable domains; (2) designing the humanized antibody, i.e., deciding which antibody framework region to use during the humanizing process; (3) the actual humanizing methodologies/techniques; and (4) the transfection and expression of the humanized antibody. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,567; 5,807,715; 5,866,692; 6,331,415; 5,530,101; 5,693,761; 5,693,762; 5,585,089; and 6,180,370.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0132">A number of &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibody molecules comprising an antigen-binding site derived from a non-human immunoglobulin have been described, including chimeric antibodies having rodent or modified rodent V regions and their associated CDRs fused to human constant domains. See, for example, Winter et al., 1991, Nature 349:293-299; Lobuglio et al., 1989, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 86:4220-4224; Shaw et al., 1987, J Immunol. 138:4534-4538; and Brown et al., 1987, Cancer Res. 47:3577-3583. Other references describe rodent CDRs grafted into a human supporting framework region (FR) prior to fusion with an appropriate human antibody constant domain. See, for example, Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature 332:323-327; Verhoeyen et al., 1988, Science 239:1534-1536; and Jones et al., 1986, Nature 321:522-525. Another reference describes rodent CDRs supported by recombinantly engineered rodent framework regions. See, for example, European Patent Publ. No. 0519596. These &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; molecules are designed to minimize unwanted immunological response toward rodent anti-human antibody molecules which limits the duration and effectiveness of therapeutic applications of those moieties in human recipients. For example, the antibody constant region can be engineered such that it is immunologically inert (e.g., does not trigger complement lysis). See, e.g., PCT Publ. No. WO99/58572; UK Patent Application No. 9809951.8. Other methods of humanizing antibodies that may also be utilized are disclosed by Daugherty et al., 1991, Nucl. Acids Res. 19:2471-2476 and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,180,377; 6,054,297; 5,997,867; 5,866,692; 6,210,671; and 6,350,861; and in PCT Publ. No. WO 01/27160.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0133">In yet another alternative, fully human antibodies may be obtained by using commercially available mice that have been engineered to express specific human immunoglobulin proteins. Transgenic animals that are designed to produce a more desirable or more robust immune response may also be used for generation of humanized or human antibodies. Examples of such technology are Xenomouse&#x2122; from Abgenix, Inc. (Fremont, Calif.), HuMAb-Mouse&#xae; and TC Mouse&#x2122; from Medarex, Inc. (Princeton, N.J.), and the VelocImmune&#xae; mouse from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Tarrytown, N.Y.).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0134">In an alternative, antibodies may be made recombinantly and expressed using any method known in the art. In another alternative, antibodies may be made recombinantly by phage display technology. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,332; 5,580,717; 5,733,743; and 6,265,150; and Winter et al., 1994, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12:433-455. Alternatively, the phage display technology (McCafferty et al., 1990, Nature 348:552-553) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats; see, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S, and Chiswell, David J., 1993, Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3:564-571. Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al., 1991, Nature 352:624-628 isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Mark et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597, or Griffith et al., 1993, EMBO J. 12:725-734. In a natural immune response, antibody genes accumulate mutations at a high rate (somatic hypermutation). Some of the changes introduced will confer higher affinity, and B cells displaying high-affinity surface immunoglobulin are preferentially replicated and differentiated during subsequent antigen challenge. This natural process can be mimicked by employing the technique known as &#x201c;chain shuffling.&#x201d; (Marks et al., 1992, Bio/Technol. 10:779-783). In this method, the affinity of &#x201c;primary&#x201d; human antibodies obtained by phage display can be improved by sequentially replacing the heavy and light chain V region genes with repertoires of naturally occurring variants (repertoires) of V domain genes obtained from unimmunized donors. This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the pM-nM range. A strategy for making very large phage antibody repertoires (also known as &#x201c;the mother-of-all libraries&#x201d;) has been described by Waterhouse et al., 1993, Nucl. Acids Res. 21:2265-2266. Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from rodent antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting rodent antibody. According to this method, which is also referred to as &#x201c;epitope imprinting&#x201d;, the heavy or light chain V domain gene of rodent antibodies obtained by phage display technique is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating rodent-human chimeras. Selection on antigen results in isolation of human variable regions capable of restoring a functional antigen-binding site, i.e., the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining rodent V domain, a human antibody is obtained (see PCT Publ. No. WO 93/06213). Unlike traditional humanization of rodent antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no framework or CDR residues of rodent origin.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0135">It is apparent that although the above discussion pertains to humanized antibodies, the general principles discussed are applicable to customizing antibodies for use, for example, in dogs, cats, primate, equines and bovines. It is further apparent that one or more aspects of humanizing an antibody described herein may be combined, e.g., CDR grafting, framework mutation and CDR mutation.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0136">Antibodies may be made recombinantly by first isolating the antibodies and antibody producing cells from host animals, obtaining the gene sequence, and using the gene sequence to express the antibody recombinantly in host cells (e.g., CHO cells). Another method which may be employed is to express the antibody sequence in plants (e.g., tobacco) or transgenic milk. Methods for expressing antibodies recombinantly in plants or milk have been disclosed. See, for example, Peeters, 2001, et al. Vaccine 19:2756; Lonberg, N. and D. Huszar, 1995, Int. Rev. Immunol 13:65; and Pollock, et al., 1999, J Immunol Methods 231:147. Methods for making derivatives of antibodies, e.g., humanized, single chain, etc. are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0137">Immunoassays and flow cytometry sorting techniques such as fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) can also be employed to isolate antibodies that are specific for PCSK9.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0138">The antibodies can be bound to many different carriers. Carriers can be active and/or inert. Examples of well-known carriers include polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene, dextran, nylon, amylases, glass, natural and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides, agaroses and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble or insoluble for purposes of the invention. Those skilled in the art will know of other suitable carriers for binding antibodies, or will be able to ascertain such, using routine experimentation. In some embodiments, the carrier comprises a moiety that targets the myocardium.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0139">DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the monoclonal antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors (such as expression vectors disclosed in PCT Publ. No. WO 87/04462), which are then transfected into host cells such as <i>E. coli </i>cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. See, e.g., PCT Publ. No. WO 87/04462. The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences, Morrison et al., 1984, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 81:6851, or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In that manner, &#x201c;chimeric&#x201d; or &#x201c;hybrid&#x201d; antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody herein.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0140">PCSK9 antagonist antibodies and polypeptides derived from antibodies can be identified or characterized using methods known in the art, whereby reduction, amelioration, or neutralization of PCSK9 biological activity is detected and/or measured. In some embodiments, a PCSK9 antagonist antibody or polypeptide is identified by incubating a candidate agent with PCSK9 and monitoring binding and/or attendant reduction or neutralization of a biological activity of PCSK9. The binding assay may be performed with purified PCSK9 polypeptide(s), or with cells naturally expressing, or transfected to express, PCSK9 polypeptide(s). In one embodiment, the binding assay is a competitive binding assay, where the ability of a candidate antibody to compete with a known PCSK9 antagonist for PCSK9 binding is evaluated. The assay may be performed in various formats, including the ELISA format. In other embodiments, a PCSK9 antagonist antibody is identified by incubating a candidate agent with PCSK9 and monitoring binding and attendant inhibition of LDLR expression and/or blood cholesterol clearance.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0141">Following initial identification, the activity of a candidate PCSK9 antagonist antibody can be further confirmed and refined by bioassays that are known to test the targeted biological activities. Alternatively, bioassays can be used to screen candidates directly. Some of the methods for identifying and characterizing PCSK9 antagonist antibodies, peptides, or aptamers are described in detail in the Examples.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0142">PCSK9 antagonist antibodies may be characterized using methods well known in the art. For example, one method is to identify the epitope to which it binds, or &#x201c;epitope mapping.&#x201d; There are many methods known in the art for mapping and characterizing the location of epitopes on proteins, including solving the crystal structure of an antibody-antigen complex, competition assays, gene fragment expression assays, and synthetic peptide-based assays, as described, for example, in Chapter 11 of Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1999). In an additional example, epitope mapping can be used to determine the sequence to which a PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds. Epitope mapping is commercially available from various sources, for example, Pepscan Systems (Edelhertweg 15, 8219 PH Lelystad, The Netherlands). The epitope can be a linear epitope, i.e., contained in a single stretch of amino acids, or a conformational epitope formed by a three-dimensional interaction of amino acids that may not necessarily be contained in a single stretch. Peptides of varying lengths (e.g., at least 4-6 amino acids long) can be isolated or synthesized (e.g., recombinantly) and used for binding assays with a PCSK9 antagonist antibody. In another example, the epitope to which the PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds can be determined in a systematic screening by using overlapping peptides derived from the PCSK9 sequence and determining binding by the PCSK9 antagonist antibody. According to the gene fragment expression assays, the open reading frame encoding PCSK9 is fragmented either randomly or by specific genetic constructions and the reactivity of the expressed fragments of PCSK9 with the antibody to be tested is determined. The gene fragments may, for example, be produced by PCR and then transcribed and translated into protein in vitro, in the presence of radioactive amino acids. The binding of the antibody to the radioactively labeled PCSK9 fragments is then determined by immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. Certain epitopes can also be identified by using large libraries of random peptide sequences displayed on the surface of phage particles (phage libraries). Alternatively, a defined library of overlapping peptide fragments can be tested for binding to the test antibody in simple binding assays. In an additional example, mutagenesis of an antigen binding domain, domain swapping experiments and alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify residues required, sufficient, and/or necessary for epitope binding. For example, domain swapping experiments can be performed using a mutant PCSK9 in which various fragments of the PCSK9 polypeptide have been replaced (swapped) with sequences from PCSK9 from another species, or a closely related, but antigenically distinct protein (such as another member of the proprotein convertase family). By assessing binding of the antibody to the mutant PCSK9, the importance of the particular PCSK9 fragment to antibody binding can be assessed.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0143">Yet another method which can be used to characterize a PCSK9 antagonist antibody is to use competition assays with other antibodies known to bind to the same antigen, i.e., various fragments on PCSK9, to determine if the PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds to the same epitope as other antibodies. Competition assays are well known to those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0144">The crystal structure of the antibody and antibody:antigen complex can also be used to characterize the antibody. The residues are identified by calculating the difference in accessible surface area between the L1L3:PCSK9 crystal structure and PCSK9 structure alone. PCSK9 residues that show buried surface area upon complex formation with L1L3 antibody are included as a part of the epitope. The solvent accessible surface of a protein is defined as the locus of the centre of a probe sphere (representing a solvent molecule of 1.4 &#x212b; radius) as it rolls over the Van der Waals surface of the protein. The solvent accessible surface area is calculated by generating surface points on an extended sphere about each atom (at a distance from the atom centre equal to the sum of the atom and probe radii), and eliminating those that lie within equivalent spheres associated with neighboring atoms as implemented in program AREAIMOL (Briggs, P. J., 2000, CCP4 Newsletter No. 38, CCLRC, Daresbury).</p><p id="p-0142" num="0145">An expression vector can be used to direct expression of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody. One skilled in the art is familiar with administration of expression vectors to obtain expression of an exogenous protein in vivo. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,436,908; 6,413,942; and 6,376,471. Administration of expression vectors includes local or systemic administration, including injection, oral administration, particle gun or catheterized administration, and topical administration. In another embodiment, the expression vector is administered directly to the sympathetic trunk or ganglion, or into a coronary artery, atrium, ventrical, or pericardium.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0146">Targeted delivery of therapeutic compositions containing an expression vector, or subgenomic polynucleotides can also be used. Receptor-mediated DNA delivery techniques are described in, for example, Findeis et al., 1993, Trends Biotechnol. 11:202; Chiou et al., 1994, Gene Therapeutics: Methods And Applications Of Direct Gene Transfer (J. A. Wolff, ed.); Wu et al., 1988, J. Biol. Chem. 263:621; Wu et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269:542; Zenke et al., 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:3655; Wu et al., 1991, J. Biol. Chem. 266:338. Therapeutic compositions containing a polynucleotide are administered in a range of about 100 ng to about 200 mg of DNA for local administration in a gene therapy protocol. Concentration ranges of about 500 ng to about 50 mg, about 1 &#x3bc;g to about 2 mg, about 5 &#x3bc;g to about 500 &#x3bc;g, and about 20 &#x3bc;g to about 100 &#x3bc;g of DNA can also be used during a gene therapy protocol. The therapeutic polynucleotides and polypeptides can be delivered using gene delivery vehicles. The gene delivery vehicle can be of viral or non-viral origin (see generally, Jolly, 1994, Cancer Gene Therapy 1:51; Kimura, 1994, Human Gene Therapy 5:845; Connelly, 1995, Human Gene Therapy 1:185; and Kaplitt, 1994, Nature Genetics 6:148). Expression of such coding sequences can be induced using endogenous mammalian or heterologous promoters. Expression of the coding sequence can be either constitutive or regulated.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0147">Viral-based vectors for delivery of a desired polynucleotide and expression in a desired cell are well known in the art. Exemplary viral-based vehicles include, but are not limited to, recombinant retroviruses (see, e.g., PCT Publ. Nos.

Determination of CDR regions is well within the skill of the art. It is understood that in some embodiments, CDRs can be a combination of the Kabat and Chothia CDR (also termed &#x201c;combined CDRs&#x201d; or &#x201c;extended CDRs&#x201d;). In some embodiments, the CDRs are the Kabat CDRs. In other embodiments, the CDRs are the Chothia CDRs. In other words, in embodiments with more than one CDR, the CDRs may be any of Kabat, Chothia, combination CDRs, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0154">The invention also provides methods of making any of these antibodies or polypeptides. The antibodies of this invention can be made by procedures known in the art. The polypeptides can be produced by proteolytic or other degradation of the antibodies, by recombinant methods (i.e., single or fusion polypeptides) as described above or by chemical synthesis. Polypeptides of the antibodies, especially shorter polypeptides up to about 50 amino acids, are conveniently made by chemical synthesis. Methods of chemical synthesis are known in the art and are commercially available. For example, an antibody could be produced by an automated polypeptide synthesizer employing the solid phase method. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 6,331,415.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0155">In another alternative, the antibodies and peptides can be made recombinantly using procedures that are well known in the art. In one embodiment, a polynucleotide comprises a sequence encoding the heavy chain and/or the light chain variable regions of antibody 4A5, 5A10, 6F6, 7D4 or L1L3. The sequence encoding the antibody of interest may be maintained in a vector in a host cell and the host cell can then be expanded and frozen for future use. Vectors (including expression vectors) and host cells are further described herein.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0156">The invention also encompasses scFv of antibodies of this invention. Single chain variable region fragments are made by linking light and/or heavy chain variable regions by using a short linking peptide. Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-426. An example of a linking peptide is (GGGGS)<sub>3 </sub>(SEQ ID NO:24), which bridges approximately 3.5 nm between the carboxy terminus of one variable region and the amino terminus of the other variable region. Linkers of other sequences have been designed and used. Bird et al., 1988, supra. Linkers should be short, flexible polypeptides and preferably comprised of less than about 20 amino acid residues. Linkers can in turn be modified for additional functions, such as attachment of drugs or attachment to solid supports. The single chain variants can be produced either recombinantly or synthetically. For synthetic production of scFv, an automated synthesizer can be used. For recombinant production of scFv, a suitable plasmid containing polynucleotide that encodes the scFv can be introduced into a suitable host cell, either eukaryotic, such as yeast, plant, insect or mammalian cells, or prokaryotic, such as <i>E. coli</i>. Polynucleotides encoding the scFv of interest can be made by routine manipulations such as ligation of polynucleotides. The resultant scFv can be isolated using standard protein purification techniques known in the art.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0157">Other forms of single chain antibodies, such as diabodies are also encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see e.g., Holliger, P., et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448; Poljak, R. J., et al., 1994, Structure 2:1121-1123).</p><p id="p-0155" num="0158">For example, bispecific antibodies, monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens, can be prepared using the antibodies disclosed herein. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art (see, e.g., Suresh et al., 1986, Methods in Enzymology 121:210). Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies was based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, with the two heavy chains having different specificities (Millstein and Cuello, 1983, Nature 305, 537-539).</p><p id="p-0156" num="0159">According to one approach to making bispecific antibodies, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region (CH1), containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are cotransfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0160">In one approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure, with an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule, facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations. This approach is described in PCT Publ. No. WO 94/04690.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0161">Heteroconjugate antibodies, comprising two covalently joined antibodies, are also within the scope of the invention. Such antibodies have been used to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (PCT Publ. Nos. WO 91/00360 and WO 92/200373; EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents and techniques are well known in the art, and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0162">Chimeric or hybrid antibodies also may be prepared in vitro using known methods of synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving cross-linking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0163">Humanized antibody comprising one or more CDRs of antibodies 5A10 or 7D4 or one or more CDRs derived from antibodies 5A10 or 7D4 can be made, for example, using any methods know in the art. For example, four general steps may be used to humanize a monoclonal antibody. These are: (1) determining the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of the starting antibody light and heavy variable domains; (2) designing the humanized antibody, i.e., deciding which antibody framework region to use during the humanizing process; (3) using the actual humanizing methodologies/techniques; and (4) transfecting and expressing the humanized antibody. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,567; 5,807,715; 5,866,692; 6,331,415; 5,530,101; 5,693,761; 5,693,762; 5,585,089; and 6,180,370.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0164">In the recombinant humanized antibodies, the Fc portion can be modified to avoid interaction with Fc&#x3b3; receptor and the complement and immune systems. The techniques for preparation of such antibodies are described in WO 99/58572. For example, the constant region may be engineered to more resemble human constant regions to avoid immune response if the antibody is used in clinical trials and treatments in humans. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,997,867 and 5,866,692.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0165">Humanized antibody comprising the light or heavy chain variable regions or one or more CDRs of an antibody or its variants shown in Table 1, or one or more CDRs derived from the antibody or its variants shown in Table 2 can be made using any methods known in the art.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0166">Humanized antibodies may be made by any method known in the art.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0167">The invention encompasses modifications to the antibodies and polypeptides of the invention variants shown in Table 1, including functionally equivalent antibodies which do not significantly affect their properties and variants which have enhanced or decreased activity and/or affinity. For example, the amino acid sequence may be mutated to obtain an antibody with the desired binding affinity to PCSK9. Modification of polypeptides is routine practice in the art and need not be described in detail herein. Modification of polypeptides is exemplified in the Examples. Examples of modified polypeptides include polypeptides with conservative substitutions of amino acid residues, one or more deletions or additions of amino acids which do not significantly deleteriously change the functional activity, or which mature (enhance) the affinity of the polypeptide for its ligand, or use of chemical analogs.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0168">Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody of an enzyme or a polypeptide which increases the half-life of the antibody in the blood circulation.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0169">Substitution variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule removed and a different residue inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 2 under the heading of &#x201c;conservative substitutions.&#x201d; If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated &#x201c;exemplary substitutions&#x201d; in Table 2, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0170"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Amino Acid Substitutions</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Original</entry><entry>Conservative</entry><entry>Exemplary</entry></row><row><entry>Residue</entry><entry>Substitutions</entry><entry>Substitutions</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Ala (A)</entry><entry>Val</entry><entry>Val; Leu; Ile</entry></row><row><entry>Arg (R)</entry><entry>Lys</entry><entry>Lys; Gln; Asn</entry></row><row><entry>Asn (N)</entry><entry>Gln</entry><entry>Gln; His; Asp, Lys; Arg</entry></row><row><entry>Asp (D)</entry><entry>Glu</entry><entry>Glu; Asn</entry></row><row><entry>Cys (C)</entry><entry>Ser</entry><entry>Ser; Ala</entry></row><row><entry>Gln (Q)</entry><entry>Asn</entry><entry>Asn; Glu</entry></row><row><entry>Glu (E)</entry><entry>Asp</entry><entry>Asp; Gln</entry></row><row><entry>Gly (G)</entry><entry>Ala</entry><entry>Ala</entry></row><row><entry>His (H)</entry><entry>Arg</entry><entry>Asn; Gln; Lys; Arg</entry></row><row><entry>Ile (I)</entry><entry>Leu</entry><entry>Leu; Val; Met; Ala; Phe; Norleucine</entry></row><row><entry>Leu (L)</entry><entry>Ile</entry><entry>Norleucine; Ile; Val; Met; Ala; Phe</entry></row><row><entry>Lys (K)</entry><entry>Arg</entry><entry>Arg; Gln; Asn</entry></row><row><entry>Met (M)</entry><entry>Leu</entry><entry>Leu; Phe; Ile</entry></row><row><entry>Phe (F)</entry><entry>Tyr</entry><entry>Leu; Val; Ile; Ala; Tyr</entry></row><row><entry>Pro (P)</entry><entry>Ala</entry><entry>Ala</entry></row><row><entry>Ser (S)</entry><entry>Thr</entry><entry>Thr</entry></row><row><entry>Thr (T)</entry><entry>Ser</entry><entry>Ser</entry></row><row><entry>Trp (W)</entry><entry>Tyr</entry><entry>Tyr; Phe</entry></row><row><entry>Tyr (Y)</entry><entry>Phe</entry><entry>Trp; Phe; Thr; Ser</entry></row><row><entry>Val (V)</entry><entry>Leu</entry><entry>Ile; Leu; Met; Phe; Ala; Norleucine</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0168" num="0171">Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain.

Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability, particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0180">Amino acid modifications can range from changing or modifying one or more amino acids to complete redesign of a region, such as the variable region. Changes in the variable region can alter binding affinity and/or specificity. In some embodiments, no more than one to five conservative amino acid substitutions are made within a CDR domain. In other embodiments, no more than one to three conservative amino acid substitutions are made within a CDR domain. In still other embodiments, the CDR domain is CDR H3 and/or CDR L3.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0181">Modifications also include glycosylated and nonglycosylated polypeptides, as well as polypeptides with other post-translational modifications, such as, for example, glycosylation with different sugars, acetylation, and phosphorylation. Antibodies are glycosylated at conserved positions in their constant regions (Jefferis and Lund, 1997, Chem. Immunol. 65:111-128; Wright and Morrison, 1997, TibTECH 15:26-32). The oligosaccharide side chains of the immunoglobulins affect the protein's function (Boyd et al., 1996, Mol. Immunol. 32:1311-1318; Wittwe and Howard, 1990, Biochem. 29:4175-4180) and the intramolecular interaction between portions of the glycoprotein, which can affect the conformation and presented three-dimensional surface of the glycoprotein (Jefferis and Lund, supra; Wyss and Wagner, 1996, Current Opin. Biotech. 7:409-416). Oligosaccharides may also serve to target a given glycoprotein to certain molecules based upon specific recognition structures. Glycosylation of antibodies has also been reported to affect antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In particular, CHO cells with tetracycline-regulated expression of &#x3b2;(1,4)&#x2014;N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), a glycosyltransferase catalyzing formation of bisecting GlcNAc, was reported to have improved ADCC activity (Umana et al., 1999, Nature Biotech. 17:176-180).</p><p id="p-0173" num="0182">Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine, asparagine-X-threonine, and asparagine-X-cysteine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0183">Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).</p><p id="p-0175" num="0184">The glycosylation pattern of antibodies may also be altered without altering the underlying nucleotide sequence. Glycosylation largely depends on the host cell used to express the antibody. Since the cell type used for expression of recombinant glycoproteins, e.g., antibodies, as potential therapeutics is rarely the native cell, variations in the glycosylation pattern of the antibodies can be expected (see, e.g., Hse et al., 1997, J. Biol. Chem. 272:9062-9070).</p><p id="p-0176" num="0185">In addition to the choice of host cells, factors that affect glycosylation during recombinant production of antibodies include growth mode, media formulation, culture density, oxygenation, pH, purification schemes and the like. Various methods have been proposed to alter the glycosylation pattern achieved in a particular host organism including introducing or overexpressing certain enzymes involved in oligosaccharide production (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,047,335; 5,510,261 and 5,278,299). Glycosylation, or certain types of glycosylation, can be enzymatically removed from the glycoprotein, for example, using endoglycosidase H (Endo H), N-glycosidase F, endoglycosidase F1, endoglycosidase F2, endoglycosidase F3. In addition, the recombinant host cell can be genetically engineered to be defective in processing certain types of polysaccharides. These and similar techniques are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0186">Other methods of modification include using coupling techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, enzymatic means, oxidative substitution and chelation. Modifications can be used, for example, for attachment of labels for immunoassay. Modified polypeptides are made using established procedures in the art and can be screened using standard assays known in the art, some of which are described below and in the Examples.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0187">In some embodiments of the invention, the antibody comprises a modified constant region, such as a constant region that is immunologically inert or partially inert, e.g., does not trigger complement mediated lysis, does not stimulate ADCC, or does not activate microglia; or have reduced activities (compared to the unmodified antibody) in any one or more of the following: triggering complement mediated lysis, stimulating ADCC, or activating microglia. Different modifications of the constant region may be used to achieve optimal level and/or combination of effector functions. See, for example, Morgan et al., 1995, Immunology 86:319-324; Lund et al., 1996, J. Immunology 157:4963-9 157:4963-4969; Idusogie et al., 2000, J. Immunology 164:4178-4184; Tao et al., 1989, J. Immunology 143: 2595-2601; and Jefferis et al., 1998, Immunological Reviews 163:59-76. In some embodiments, the constant region is modified as described in Eur. J. Immunol., 1999, 29:2613-2624; PCT Publ. No. WO99/58572; and/or UK Patent Application No. 9809951.8. In other embodiments, the antibody comprises a human heavy chain IgG2 constant region comprising the following mutations: A330P331 to S330S331 (amino acid numbering with reference to the wild type IgG2 sequence). Eur. J. Immunol., 1999, 29:2613-2624. In still other embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation. In some embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation by mutating the glycosylated amino acid residue or flanking residues that are part of the N-glycosylation recognition sequence in the constant region. For example, N-glycosylation site N297 may be mutated to A, Q, K, or H. See, Tao et al., 1989, J. Immunology 143: 2595-2601; and Jefferis et al., 1998, Immunological Reviews 163:59-76. In some embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation. The constant region may be aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation enzymatically (such as removing carbohydrate by enzyme PNGase), or by expression in a glycosylation deficient host cell.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0188">Other antibody modifications include antibodies that have been modified as described in PCT Publ. No. WO 99/58572. These antibodies comprise, in addition to a binding domain directed at the target molecule, an effector domain having an amino acid sequence substantially homologous to all or part of a constant domain of a human immunoglobulin heavy chain. These antibodies are capable of binding the target molecule without triggering significant complement dependent lysis, or cell-mediated destruction of the target. In some embodiments, the effector domain is capable of specifically binding FcRn and/or Fc&#x3b3;RIIb. These are typically based on chimeric domains derived from two or more human immunoglobulin heavy chain C<sub>H</sub>2 domains. Antibodies modified in this manner are particularly suitable for use in chronic antibody therapy, to avoid inflammatory and other adverse reactions to conventional antibody therapy.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0189">The invention includes affinity matured embodiments. For example, affinity matured antibodies can be produced by procedures known in the art (Marks et al., 1992, Bio/Technology, 10:779-783; Barbas et al., 1994, Proc Nat. Acad. Sci, USA 91:3809-3813; Schier et al., 1995, Gene, 169:147-155; Yelton et al., 1995, J. Immunol., 155:1994-2004; Jackson et al., 1995, J. Immunol., 154(7):3310-9; Hawkins et al., 1992, J. Mol. Biol., 226:889-896; and PCT Publ. No. WO2004/058184).</p><p id="p-0181" num="0190">The following methods may be used for adjusting the affinity of an antibody and for characterizing a CDR. One way of characterizing a CDR of an antibody and/or altering (such as improving) the binding affinity of a polypeptide, such as an antibody, termed &#x201c;library scanning mutagenesis&#x201d;. Generally, library scanning mutagenesis works as follows. One or more amino acid positions in the CDR are replaced with two or more (such as 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20) amino acids using art recognized methods. This generates small libraries of clones (in some embodiments, one for every amino acid position that is analyzed), each with a complexity of two or more members (if two or more amino acids are substituted at every position). Generally, the library also includes a clone comprising the native (unsubstituted) amino acid. A small number of clones, e.g., about 20-80 clones (depending on the complexity of the library), from each library are screened for binding affinity to the target polypeptide (or other binding target), and candidates with increased, the same, decreased, or no binding are identified. Methods for determining binding affinity are well-known in the art. Binding affinity may be determined using Biacore surface plasmon resonance analysis, which detects differences in binding affinity of about 2-fold or greater. Biacore is particularly useful when the starting antibody already binds with a relatively high affinity, for example a K<sub>D </sub>of about 10 nM or lower. Screening using Biacore surface plasmon resonance is described in the Examples, herein.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0191">Binding affinity may be determined using Kinexa Biocensor, scintillation proximity assays, ELISA, ORIGEN immunoassay (IGEN), fluorescence quenching, fluorescence transfer, and/or yeast display. Binding affinity may also be screened using a suitable bioassay.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0192">In some embodiments, every amino acid position in a CDR is replaced (in some embodiments, one at a time) with all 20 natural amino acids using art recognized mutagenesis methods (some of which are described herein). This generates small libraries of clones (in some embodiments, one for every amino acid position that is analyzed), each with a complexity of 20 members (if all 20 amino acids are substituted at every position).</p><p id="p-0184" num="0193">In some embodiments, the library to be screened comprises substitutions in two or more positions, which may be in the same CDR or in two or more CDRs. Thus, the library may comprise substitutions in two or more positions in one CDR. The library may comprise substitution in two or more positions in two or more CDRs. The library may comprise substitution in 3, 4, 5, or more positions, said positions found in two, three, four, five or six CDRs. The substitution may be prepared using low redundancy codons. See, e.g., Table 2 of Balint et al., 1993, Gene 137(1):109-18).</p><p id="p-0185" num="0194">The CDR may be CDRH3 and/or CDRL3. The CDR may be one or more of CDRL1, CDRL2, CDRL3, CDRH1, CDRH2, and/or CDRH3. The CDR may be a Kabat CDR, a Chothia CDR, or an extended CDR.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0195">Candidates with improved binding may be sequenced, thereby identifying a CDR substitution mutant which results in improved affinity (also termed an &#x201c;improved&#x201d; substitution). Candidates that bind may also be sequenced, thereby identifying a CDR substitution which retains binding.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0196">Multiple rounds of screening may be conducted. For example, candidates (each comprising an amino acid substitution at one or more position of one or more CDR) with improved binding are also useful for the design of a second library containing at least the original and substituted amino acid at each improved CDR position (i.e., amino acid position in the CDR at which a substitution mutant showed improved binding). Preparation, screening, and selection of this library is discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0197">Library scanning mutagenesis also provides a means for characterizing a CDR, in so far as the frequency of clones with improved binding, the same binding, decreased binding or no binding also provide information relating to the importance of each amino acid position for the stability of the antibody-antigen complex. For example, if a position of the CDR retains binding when changed to all 20 amino acids, that position is identified as a position that is unlikely to be required for antigen binding. Conversely, if a position of CDR retains binding in only a small percentage of substitutions, that position is identified as a position that is important to CDR function. Thus, the library scanning mutagenesis methods generate information regarding positions in the CDRs that can be changed to many different amino acids (including all 20 amino acids), and positions in the CDRs which cannot be changed or which can only be changed to a few amino acids.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0198">Candidates with improved affinity may be combined in a second library, which includes the improved amino acid, the original amino acid, and may further include additional substitutions at that position, depending on the complexity of the library that is desired, or permitted using the desired screening or selection method. In addition, if desired, and adjacent amino acid position can be randomized to at least two or more amino acids. Randomization of adjacent amino acids may permit additional conformational flexibility in the mutant CDR, which may, in turn, permit or facilitate the introduction of a larger number of improving mutations. The library may also comprise substitution at positions that did not show improved affinity in the first round of screening.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0199">The second library is screened or selected for library members with improved and/or altered binding affinity using any method known in the art, including screening using Biacore surface plasmon resonance analysis, and selection using any method known in the art for selection, including phage display, yeast display, and ribosome display.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0200">The invention also encompasses fusion proteins comprising one or more fragments or regions from the antibodies or polypeptides of this invention. In one embodiment, a fusion polypeptide is provided that comprises at least 10 contiguous amino acids of a variable light chain region shown in SEQ ID NOs: 53, 16, 17, 18, or 19 and/or at least 10 amino acids of a variable heavy chain region shown in SEQ ID NOs: 54, 20, 21, 22, or 23. In other embodiments, a fusion polypeptide is provided that comprises at least about 10, at least about 15, at least about 20, at least about 25, or at least about 30 contiguous amino acids of the variable light chain region and/or at least about 10, at least about 15, at least about 20, at least about 25, or at least about 30 contiguous amino acids of the variable heavy chain region. In another embodiment, the fusion polypeptide comprises a light chain variable region and/or a heavy chain variable region, as shown in any of the sequence pairs selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 53 and 54, 16 and 20, 17 and 21, 18 and 22, and 19 and 23. In another embodiment, the fusion polypeptide comprises one or more CDR(s). In still other embodiments, the fusion polypeptide comprises CDR H3 (VH CDR3) and/or CDR L3 (VL CDR3). For purposes of this invention, a fusion protein contains one or more antibodies and another amino acid sequence to which it is not attached in the native molecule, for example, a heterologous sequence or a homologous sequence from another region. Exemplary heterologous sequences include, but are not limited to a &#x201c;tag&#x201d; such as a FLAG tag or a 6H is tag. Tags are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0201">A fusion polypeptide can be created by methods known in the art, for example, synthetically or recombinantly.

For simplicity, reference will be made generally to antibodies with the understanding that these methods apply to any of the PCSK9 binding and/or antagonist embodiments described herein. Conjugation generally refers to linking these components as described herein. The linking (which is generally fixing these components in proximate association at least for administration) can be achieved in any number of ways. For example, a direct reaction between an agent and an antibody is possible when each possesses a substituent capable of reacting with the other. For example, a nucleophilic group, such as an amino or sulfhydryl group, on one may be capable of reacting with a carbonyl-containing group, such as an anhydride or an acid halide, or with an alkyl group containing a good leaving group (e.g., a halide) on the other.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0203">An antibody or polypeptide of this invention may be linked to a labeling agent such as a fluorescent molecule, a radioactive molecule or any others labels known in the art.

Polynucleotides may be single-stranded (coding or antisense) or double-stranded, and may be DNA (genomic, cDNA or synthetic) or RNA molecules. RNA molecules include HnRNA molecules, which contain introns and correspond to a DNA molecule in a one-to-one manner, and mRNA molecules, which do not contain introns. Additional coding or non-coding sequences may, but need not, be present within a polynucleotide of the present invention, and a polynucleotide may, but need not, be linked to other molecules and/or support materials.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0211">Polynucleotides may comprise a native sequence (i.e., an endogenous sequence that encodes an antibody or a portion thereof) or may comprise a variant of such a sequence. Polynucleotide variants contain one or more substitutions, additions, deletions and/or insertions such that the immunoreactivity of the encoded polypeptide is not diminished, relative to a native immunoreactive molecule. The effect on the immunoreactivity of the encoded polypeptide may generally be assessed as described herein. Variants preferably exhibit at least about 70% identity, more preferably, at least about 80% identity, yet more preferably, at least about 90% identity, and most preferably, at least about 95% identity to a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a native antibody or a portion thereof.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0212">Two polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences are said to be &#x201c;identical&#x201d; if the sequence of nucleotides or amino acids in the two sequences is the same when aligned for maximum correspondence as described below. Comparisons between two sequences are typically performed by comparing the sequences over a comparison window to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. A &#x201c;comparison window&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a segment of at least about 20 contiguous positions, usually 30 to about 75, or 40 to about 50, in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0213">Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted using the Megalign program in the Lasergene suite of bioinformatics software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, Wis.), using default parameters.

The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid bases or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the reference sequence (i.e. the window size) and multiplying the results by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0215">Variants may also, or alternatively, be substantially homologous to a native gene, or a portion or complement thereof. Such polynucleotide variants are capable of hybridizing under moderately stringent conditions to a naturally occurring DNA sequence encoding a native antibody (or a complementary sequence).</p><p id="p-0207" num="0216">Suitable &#x201c;moderately stringent conditions&#x201d; include prewashing in a solution of 5&#xd7;SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0); hybridizing at 50&#xb0; C.-65&#xb0; C., 5&#xd7;SSC, overnight; followed by washing twice at 65&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes with each of 2&#xd7;, 0.5&#xd7; and 0.2&#xd7;SSC containing 0.1% SDS.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0217">As used herein, &#x201c;highly stringent conditions&#x201d; or &#x201c;high stringency conditions&#x201d; are those that: (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example 0.015 M sodium chloride/0.0015 M sodium citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50&#xb0; C.; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.1&#xb0; k Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42&#xb0; C.; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5&#xd7;SSC (0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5&#xd7;Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 &#x3bc;g/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42&#xb0; C., with washes at 42&#xb0; C. in 0.2&#xd7;SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate) and 50% formamide at 55&#xb0; C., followed by a high-stringency wash consisting of 0.1&#xd7;SSC containing EDTA at 55&#xb0; C.

Some of these polynucleotides bear minimal homology to the nucleotide sequence of any native gene. Nonetheless, polynucleotides that vary due to differences in codon usage are specifically contemplated by the present invention. Further, alleles of the genes comprising the polynucleotide sequences provided herein are within the scope of the present invention. Alleles are endogenous genes that are altered as a result of one or more mutations, such as deletions, additions and/or substitutions of nucleotides. The resulting mRNA and protein may, but need not, have an altered structure or function. Alleles may be identified using standard techniques (such as hybridization, amplification and/or database sequence comparison).</p><p id="p-0210" num="0219">The polynucleotides of this invention can be obtained using chemical synthesis, recombinant methods, or PCR. Methods of chemical polynucleotide synthesis are well known in the art and need not be described in detail herein. One of skill in the art can use the sequences provided herein and a commercial DNA synthesizer to produce a desired DNA sequence.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0220">For preparing polynucleotides using recombinant methods, a polynucleotide comprising a desired sequence can be inserted into a suitable vector, and the vector in turn can be introduced into a suitable host cell for replication and amplification, as further discussed herein. Polynucleotides may be inserted into host cells by any means known in the art. Cells are transformed by introducing an exogenous polynucleotide by direct uptake, endocytosis, transfection, F-mating or electroporation. Once introduced, the exogenous polynucleotide can be maintained within the cell as a non-integrated vector (such as a plasmid) or integrated into the host cell genome. The polynucleotide so amplified can be isolated from the host cell by methods well known within the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, supra.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0221">Alternatively, PCR allows reproduction of DNA sequences. PCR technology is well known in the art and is described in U.S. Pat.

While the cloning vector selected may vary according to the host cell intended to be used, useful cloning vectors will generally have the ability to self-replicate, may possess a single target for a particular restriction endonuclease, and/or may carry genes for a marker that can be used in selecting clones containing the vector. Suitable examples include plasmids and bacterial viruses, e.g., pUC18, pUC19, Bluescript (e.g., pBS SK+) and its derivatives, mp 18, mp 19, pBR322, pMB9, ColE1, pCR1, RP4, phage DNAs, and shuttle vectors such as pSA3 and pAT28.

It is implied that an expression vector must be replicable in the host cells either as episomes or as an integral part of the chromosomal DNA. Suitable expression vectors include but are not limited to plasmids, viral vectors, including adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, retroviruses, cosmids, and expression vector(s) disclosed in PCT Publ. No. WO 87/04462. Vector components may generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence; an origin of replication; one or more marker genes; suitable transcriptional controlling elements (such as promoters, enhancers and terminator). For expression (i.e., translation), one or more translational controlling elements are also usually required, such as ribosome binding sites, translation initiation sites, and stop codons.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0225">The vectors containing the polynucleotides of interest can be introduced into the host cell by any of a number of appropriate means, including electroporation, transfection employing calcium chloride, rubidium chloride, calcium phosphate, DEAE-dextran, or other substances; microprojectile bombardment; lipofection; and infection (e.g., where the vector is an infectious agent such as vaccinia virus). The choice of introducing vectors or polynucleotides will often depend on features of the host cell.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0226">The invention also provides host cells comprising any of the polynucleotides described herein. Any host cells capable of over-expressing heterologous DNAs can be used for the purpose of isolating the genes encoding the antibody, polypeptide or protein of interest.

In some embodiments, the antibody is human. In other embodiments, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. The instructions relating to the use of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody generally include information as to dosage, dosing schedule, and route of administration for the intended treatment. The containers may be unit doses, bulk packages (e.g., multi-dose packages) or sub-unit doses. Instructions supplied in the kits of the invention are typically written instructions on a label or package insert (e.g., a paper sheet included in the kit), but machine-readable instructions (e.g., instructions carried on a magnetic or optical storage disk) are also acceptable.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0234">The kits of this invention are in suitable packaging.

Various modifications, e.g., mutations, deletions, and/or additions can also be introduced into the DNA sequences using standard methods known to those of skill in the art. For example, mutagenesis can be carried out using standard methods, such as PCR-mediated mutagenesis, in which the mutated nucleotides are incorporated into the PCR primers such that the PCR product contains the desired mutations or site-directed mutagenesis.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0237">One type of substitution, for example, that may be made is to change one or more cysteines in the antibody, which may be chemically reactive, to another residue, such as, without limitation, alanine or serine. For example, there can be a substitution of a non-canonical cysteine. The substitution can be made in a CDR or framework region of a variable domain or in the constant domain of an antibody. In some embodiments, the cysteine is canonical.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0238">The antibodies may also be modified, e.g., in the variable domains of the heavy and/or light chains, e.g., to alter a binding property of the antibody. For example, a mutation may be made in one or more of the CDR regions to increase or decrease the K<sub>D </sub>of the antibody for PCSK9, to increase or decrease k<sub>off</sub>, or to alter the binding specificity of the antibody. Techniques in site-directed mutagenesis are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al., supra.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0239">A modification or mutation may also be made in a framework region or constant domain to increase the half-life of a PCSK9 antibody. See, e.g., PCT Publ. No. WO 00/09560. A mutation in a framework region or constant domain can also be made to alter the immunogenicity of the antibody, to provide a site for covalent or non-covalent binding to another molecule, or to alter such properties as complement fixation, FcR binding and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. According to the invention, a single antibody may have mutations in any one or more of the CDRs or framework regions of the variable domain or in the constant domain.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0240">In a process known as &#x201c;germlining&#x201d;, certain amino acids in the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>sequences can be mutated to match those found naturally in germline V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>sequences. In particular, the amino acid sequences of the framework regions in the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>sequences can be mutated to match the germline sequences to reduce the risk of immunogenicity when the antibody is administered. Germline DNA sequences for human V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>genes are known in the art (see e.g., the &#x201c;Vbase&#x201d; human germline sequence database; see also Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publ. No. 91-3242; Tomlinson et al., 1992, J. Mol. Biol. 227:776-798; and Cox et al., 1994, Eur. J. Immunol. 24:827-836.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0241">Another type of amino acid substitution that may be made is to remove potential proteolytic sites in the antibody. Such sites may occur in a CDR or framework region of a variable domain or in the constant domain of an antibody. Substitution of cysteine residues and removal of proteolytic sites may decrease the risk of heterogeneity in the antibody product and thus increase its homogeneity. Another type of amino acid substitution eliminates asparagine-glycine pairs, which form potential deamidation sites, by altering one or both of the residues.

The sequences corresponding to the loops are shown in Table 5, and in a preferred embodiment, the antagonists of the invention bind to one or more of these sequences in PSCK9.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0269"><tables id="TABLE-US-00005" num="00005"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE&#x2003;5</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>PCSK9&#x2003;Loops</entry><entry>Sequence</entry><entry>SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>186-200</entry><entry>DTSIQSDHREIEGRV</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>236-245</entry><entry>GRDAGVAKGA</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>371-379</entry><entry>ASSDCSTCF</entry><entry>3</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>176-181</entry><entry>GGSLVE</entry><entry>4</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>278-283</entry><entry>QPVGPL</entry><entry>5</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>449-453</entry><entry>HGAGW</entry><entry>6</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>402-406</entry><entry>AEPEL</entry><entry>7</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0261" num="0270">f.

All the results fit nicely to a 1:1 binding kinetics model. As expected, mutation at residues in direct contact with the EGF-A domain (F379A, R194A, 1369A, T377R, D238R) significantly weakens (by 10-100 fold) LDLR binding. Moreover, three mutants not in contact with EGF-A (R199A, R218A, K222A) showed weaker binding (5-15 fold). This new finding suggests that they are involved in binding other domains of LDLR.

Over 500 positive clones were obtained and allowed to grow to confluency in 6 well plates with 10 ml media. Media supernatant were collected and total IgGs in the conditioned media were purified using mAb Select (Pierce). The ability of purified and concentrated mouse IgGs to inhibit mouse and human PCSK9 function was tested in Huh7 cells using the methods described in Example 1. Hybridoma clones expressing IgGs that showed some degrees of blocking were expanded and retested. 60 promising clones were subcloned, expanded, and injected into either Balb/c or nude mice to produce ascites. Antibodies purified from ascites fluid were retested for their ability to inhibit the down regulation of LDLR by human or mouse PCSK9 in Huh7 cells. Four hybridoma clones, 4A5, 5A10, 6F6, and 7D4, were identified as being able to completely inhibit human PCSK9 function, and at least partially inhibit mouse PCSK9 function.
