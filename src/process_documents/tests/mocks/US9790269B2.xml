TTR is also known as CTS, HsT2651, PALB, prealbumin, and TBPA. TTR is synthesized in the liver, choroid plexus and retinal pigment epithelium for secretion into blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the eye, respectively. In the blood, TTR serves as a carrier for the retinol-binding protein-retinol (vitamin A) complex, whereas in CSF and the eye, it carries both thyroxine and holo retinol-binding protein. In its native state, TTR exists as a tetramer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">TTR is an amyloidogenic protein that can form fibrils and other aggregates. Rate-limiting TTR tetramer dissociation can generate dimers which subsequently can dissociate into monomers. These monomers can subsequently adopt misfolded conformations and aggregate into TTR oligomers and amyloid fibrils in a process known as amyloidogenesis. Mounting evidence indicates that the active aggregation of misfolded monomeric TTR or TTR amyloidogenesis is a root cause of TTR amyloid diseases.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The process of TTR amyloid fibril formation or amyloidogenesis is associated with a number of diseases, which present a significant burden on human health. For example, wild-type TTR amyloidogenesis is associated with senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA), a cardiomyopathy affecting up to 25% of the population above the age of 80. Another example of a TTR-related amyloid disease is the autosomal dominantly inherited disorder familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP). FAP is a relentless degenerative disease that strikes between the age 20-60 and causes progressive peripheral nerve degeneration, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and in many individuals cardiomyopathy. Without a liver transplant, FAP is usually fatal within 10-12 years. Familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC), another inherited TTR-aggregation-associated disease, can lead to congestive heart failure and death. There are now more than 100 TTR point mutations associated with the hereditary amyloid diseases. Many of these diseases are often misdiagnosed because their symptoms can be mistaken for other diseases. Misdiagnosis and the general lack of early diagnostic methods for the TTR-related amyloidoses currently present a significant roadblock to effective treatment, as irreversible degeneration has often occurred by the time treatment is initiated.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the invention provides an anti-transthyretin

For example, the term &#x201c;a cell&#x201d; includes a plurality of cells, including mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Definitions</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The terms &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d;, &#x201c;peptide&#x201d;, and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein and refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The polymer may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and it may be interrupted by non-amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified; for example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation, such as conjugation with a labeling component. As used herein the term &#x201c;amino acid&#x201d; refers to either natural and/or unnatural or synthetic amino acids, including glycine and both the D or L optical isomers, and amino acid analogs and peptidomimetics.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The term &#x201c;amino acid&#x201d;, as used herein, encompasses naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g., &#x3b3;-carboxyglutamate, hydroxyproline, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an a carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group. Exemplary amino acid analogs include but are not limited to homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, and methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs can have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, as long as they retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. &#x201c;Amino acid mimetics&#x201d; refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Amino acids may be referred to herein by either the commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; or &#x201c;antibodies&#x201d; or as used herein refers to immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules and antigen-binding portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site which specifically binds to an antigen. Structurally, a simple naturally occurring antibody (e.g., IgG) comprises four polypeptide chains: two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains that are inter-connected by disulfide bonds. The natural immunoglobulins represent a large family of molecules that include several types of molecules, such as IgD, IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">&#x201c;Antibodies&#x201d; can also refer to hybrid or altered antibodies. The antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a naturally-occurring antibody, therefore, the term &#x201c;antibodies&#x201d; also encompasses fragments of antibodies, altered antibodies, or hybrid antibodies, including but not limited to Fab fragment(s), and Fv fragments. These fragments are also known as &#x201c;antigen-binding fragments&#x201d;. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term &#x201c;antigen-binding fragments&#x201d; include but are not limited to (i) Fab fragments consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) Fd fragments consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iii) Fv fragments consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (iv) dAb fragments which consists of a VH domain as described by (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), (v) isolated complementarity determining regions (CDRs); and (vi) F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragments, which are bivalent fragments comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment are generally coded for by separate genes, a synthetic linker can be made that enables them to be made as a single protein chain (known as single chain Fv (scFv); Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) PNAS 85:5879-5883) by recombinant methods. Such single chain antibodies are also encompassed within the term &#x201c;antigen-binding fragments&#x201d;. Preferably, the antibody fragments are those which are capable of crosslinking their target antigen, such as, e.g., bivalent fragments such as F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragments. Alternatively, antibody fragments which do not themselves crosslink their target antigen (e.g., a Fab fragments) can be used in conjunction with secondary antibodies which serves to crosslink the antibody fragment, thereby crosslinking the target antigen.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Antibodies can be fragmented using conventional techniques described herein or known in the art and the fragments screened for utility in the same manner as described for whole antibodies. A Fab fragment of an immunoglobulin molecule is a multimeric protein consisting of the portion of an immunoglobulin molecule containing the immunologically active portions of an immunoglobulin heavy chain and an immunoglobulin light chain covalently coupled together and capable of specifically combining with an antigen. Fab fragments can be prepared, for example, by proteolytic digestion of substantially intact immunoglobulin molecules using methods that are well known in the art, e.g., by papain digestion. However, Fab fragments may also be prepared by expressing in a suitable host cell the desired portions of immunoglobulin heavy chain and immunoglobulin light chain using methods disclosed herein or any other methods known in the art.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">An Fv fragment of an immunoglobulin molecule is a multimeric protein consisting of the immunologically active portions of an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region and an immunoglobulin light chain variable region covalently coupled together and capable of specifically binding to an antigen. Fv fragments are typically prepared by expressing in suitable host cell the desired portions of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region and immunoglobulin light chain variable region using methods described herein and/or other methods known to artisans in the field.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The term &#x201c;antibodies&#x201d; can also include bispecific and chimeric molecules having a desired binding portion. Also encompassed within the term &#x201c;antibodies&#x201d; are vertebrate antibodies, hybrid antibodies or chimeric antibodies.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The term &#x201c;antibodies&#x201d; also encompasses humanized antibodies. Humanized&#x201d; forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies include chimeric antibodies containing minimal sequence derived from a non-human Ig. In some embodiments, the humanized antibodies are human Igs (recipient antibody) in which one or more of the CDRs of the recipient are replaced by CDRs from a non-human donor antibody, such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate antibody having the desired specificity, affinity and binding function. In some embodiments, one or more FR amino acid residues of the human Ig are replaced by corresponding non-human amino acid residues. In some cases, humanized antibodies contain modified residues which are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modified residues can serve to refine antibody performance, if needed. A humanized antibody can comprise substantially all of at least one and, in some cases two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable regions correspond to those of a non-human donor Ig and all, or substantially all, of the FRs are those of a human Ig sequence. The humanized antibody optionally can also include at least a portion of an Ig constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For details, see Jones et al., Nature 321: 522-525 (1986); Reichmann et al., Nature 332: 323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2: 593-596 (1992).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">&#x201c;Humanized antibodies&#x201d; also encompasses antibodies in which part, or all of the CDRs of the heavy and light chain are derived from a non-human monoclonal antibody, substantially all the remaining portions of the variable regions are derived from human variable region (both heavy and light chain), and the constant regions are derived from a human constant region. In one embodiment, the CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 regions of the heavy and light chains are derived from a non-human antibody. In yet another embodiment, at least one CDR (for example, a CDR3) of the heavy and light chains is derived from a non-human antibody. A person of skill in the art will understand that any combination of CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 derived from a non-human antibody are within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The term &#x201c;antibodies&#x201d; also encompasses catalytic antibodies, e.g., antibodies that harbor antigen-specific catalytic activity. Antigen-specific catalytic activity may include, for example, antigen-specific proteolytic cleavage. Catalytic antibodies, and methods of producing the same, are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,658,753 and 7,205,136.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">&#x201c;Antigen&#x201d; as used herein means a substance that is recognized and bound specifically by an antibody. Antigens can include peptides, proteins, glycoproteins, polysaccharides and lipids; portions thereof and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">A &#x201c;host cell&#x201d; includes an individual cell or cell culture which can be or has been a recipient for the subject vectors. Host cells include progeny of a single host cell. The progeny may not necessarily be completely identical (in morphology or in genomic of total DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation. A host cell includes cells transfected in vivo with a vector of this invention.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">A &#x201c;cell line&#x201d; or &#x201c;cell culture&#x201d; denotes bacterial, plant, insect or higher eukaryotic cells grown or maintained in vitro. The descendants of a cell may not be completely identical (either morphologically, genotypically, or phenotypically) to the parent cell.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">A &#x201c;defined medium&#x201d; refers to a medium comprising nutritional and hormonal requirements necessary for the survival and/or growth of the cells in culture such that the components of the medium are known. Traditionally, the defined medium has been formulated by the addition of nutritional and growth factors necessary for growth and/or survival. Typically, the defined medium provides at least one component from one or more of the following categories: a) all essential amino acids, and usually the basic set of twenty amino acids plus cysteine; b) an energy source, usually in the form of a carbohydrate such as glucose; c) vitamins and/or other organic compounds required at low concentrations; d) free fatty acids; and e) trace elements, where trace elements are defined as inorganic compounds or naturally occurring elements that are typically required at very low concentrations, usually in the micromolar range. The defined medium may also optionally be supplemented with one or more components from any of the following categories: a) one or more mitogenic agents; b) salts and buffers as, for example, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate; c) nucleosides and bases such as, for example, adenosine and thymidine, hypoxanthine; and d) protein and tissue hydrolysates.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">&#x201c;Homology&#x201d; or &#x201c;identity&#x201d; or &#x201c;similarity&#x201d; refers to sequence similarity between two peptides or between two polynucleotides. Homology and identity can each be determined by comparing a position in each sequence which may be aligned for purposes of comparison. When an equivalent position in the compared sequences is occupied by the same base or amino acid, then the molecules are identical at that position; when the equivalent site occupied by the same or a similar amino acid residue (e.g., similar in steric and/or electronic nature), then the molecules can be referred to as homologous (similar) at that position. Expression as a percentage of homology/similarity or identity refers to a function of the number of identical or similar amino acids at positions shared by the compared sequences.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">As used herein, the term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; means separated from constituents, cellular and otherwise, in which the polynucleotide, peptide, polypeptide, protein, antibody, or fragments thereof, are normally associated with in nature. As is apparent to those of skill in the art, a non-naturally occurring the polynucleotide, peptide, polypeptide, protein, antibody, or fragments thereof, does not require &#x201c;isolation&#x201d; to distinguish it from its naturally occurring counterpart. In addition, a &#x201c;concentrated&#x201d;, &#x201c;separated&#x201d; or &#x201c;diluted&#x201d; polynucleotide, peptide, polypeptide, protein, antibody, or fragments thereof, is distinguishable from its naturally occurring counterpart in that the concentration or number of molecules per volume is greater than &#x201c;concentrated&#x201d; or less than &#x201c;separated&#x201d; than that of its naturally occurring counterpart.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Enrichment can be measured on an absolute basis, such as weight per volume of solution, or it can be measured in relation to a second, potentially interfering substance present in the source mixture. Increasing enrichments of the embodiments of this invention are increasingly more preferred. Thus, for example, a 2-fold enrichment is preferred, 10-fold enrichment is more preferred, 100-fold enrichment is more preferred, 1000-fold enrichment is even more preferred. A substance can also be provided in an isolated state by a process of artificial assembly, such as by chemical synthesis or recombinant expression.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">An &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; antibody can also be &#x201c;substantially pure&#x201d; when free of most or all of the materials with which it typically associates with in nature. Thus, an isolated antibody sample that is substantially pure does not include polypeptides or polynucleotides present among millions of other sequences, such as antibodies of an antibody library or nucleic acids in a genomic or cDNA library, for example. Of course, a &#x201c;substantially pure&#x201d; molecule can be combined with one or more other molecules. Thus, the term &#x201c;substantially pure&#x201d; is not meant to exclude combination compositions.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">A sample of isolated antibody can be considered &#x201c;substantially pure&#x201d; if the antibody accounts for 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or more than 90% of the sample by weight. Purity can be determined by any appropriate method, including but not limited to, UV spectroscopy, chromatography (e.g., HPLC, gas phase), gel electrophoresis (e.g., silver or coomassie staining) and sequence analysis (nucleic acid and peptide).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the context of polypeptides, a &#x201c;linear sequence&#x201d; or a &#x201c;sequence&#x201d; is an order of amino acids in a polypeptide in an amino to carboxyl terminus direction in which residues that neighbor each other in the sequence are contiguous in the primary structure of the polypeptide. A &#x201c;partial sequence&#x201d; is a linear sequence of part of a polypeptide which is known to comprise additional residues in one or both directions.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The terms &#x201c;polynucleotides&#x201d;, &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d;, &#x201c;nucleotides&#x201d; and &#x201c;oligonucleotides&#x201d; are used interchangeably. They refer to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, either deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides, or analogs thereof. Polynucleotides may have any three-dimensional structure, and may perform any function, known or unknown. The following are non-limiting examples of polynucleotides: coding or non-coding regions of a gene or gene fragment, loci (locus) defined from linkage analysis, exons, introns, messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, ribozymes, cDNA, recombinant polynucleotides, branched polynucleotides, plasmids, vectors, isolated DNA of any sequence, isolated RNA of any sequence, nucleic acid probes, and primers. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and nucleotide analogs. If present, modifications to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components.

Such antibodies have a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides anti-transthyretin antibodies that exhibit selective binding to non-native forms of TTR under physiologically relevant conditions, as compared to tetrameric TTR for said antibody binding. In a related aspect, the invention provides anti-transthyretin antibodies that exhibit selective binding to non-native forms of mutant TTR present in an amyloid disease carrier under physiologically relevant conditions as compared to a tetrameric form of said mutant TTR.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The term &#x201c;bind&#x201d; or &#x201c;binding&#x201d; means that the binding partners referred to have affinity for each other. The term &#x201c;specific&#x201d; or &#x201c;selective&#x201d; and grammatical variations thereof, when used in reference to binding, means that the binding between the binding partners is such that it can be distinguished from non-specific or non-selective binding to other molecules. For example, an antibody exhibits &#x201c;selective binding&#x201d; to an antigen if it binds with greater affinity or avidity than it binds to other reference antigens including polypeptides or other substances. In some embodiments, the antibodies exhibit a 1.1-fold, 1.2-fold, 1.3-fold, 1.4-fold, 1.5-fold, 1.6-fold, 1.7-fold, 1.8-fold, 1.9-fold, 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 20-fold, 30-fold, 40-fold, 50-fold, 60-fold, 70-fold, 80-fold, 90-fold, 100-fold, or more than 100-fold greater binding to non-native TTR as compared to native TTR of the same composition. In particular embodiments, the antibodies exhibit a 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 20-fold, 30-fold, 40-fold, 50-fold, 60-fold, 70-fold, 80-fold, 90-fold, 100-fold, or more than 100-fold greater binding to non-native TTR as compared to native TTR of the same composition. Selective binding can be ascertained using a binding assay such as, e.g., ELISA, immunoprecipitation, coprecipitation, western blotting, surface plasmon resonance, multiplex immunoassay, two-hybrid assays and the like. In some embodiments, the binding assay is an ELISA assay. In one embodiment, the ELISA assay is an indirect (e.g., sandwich) assay. Such binding assays can produce a stronger detectable signal in a sample wherein an antibody of the present invention is reacted with non-native TTR, as compared to a sample wherein the antibody is reacted with native TTR. Generally, a detectable signal can be described as a signal produced by a detectable label. The detectable label can be any molecule that can be conjugated to another molecule so as to enable detection of the conjugated molecule. Non-limiting examples of detectable labels include chelators, photoactive agents, radionuclides (alpha, beta and gamma emitters), fluorescent agents, luminescent agents, nanoparticles, paramagnetic ions, or enzymes that produce a detectable signal in the presence of certain reagents (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose oxidase).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The terms &#x201c;tetrameric TTR&#x201d; and &#x201c;native TTR&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein to refer to a protein formed by the association of four TTR monomers. Structurally, the TTR tetramer features two thyroxine-binding sites that are formed by the weaker dimer-dimer interface of TTR. Each TTR monomer comprises 127 amino acids. Within the native tetramer, the monomer is made up of two face-to-face &#x3b2;-sheets, containing &#x3b2;-strands CBEF and DAGH, respectively. The amino acid sequence of the TTR monomer with the &#x3b2;-strands labeled is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">&#x201c;Non-native TTR forms&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to structural TTR conformations that are associated with formation of TTR aggregates including amyloid fibrils. The rate-limiting step of TTR amyloid formation is dissociation of tetrameric TTR into monomeric TTR. It is believed that upon dissociation of tetrameric TTR into monomeric TTR, monomeric TTR exhibits instability, adopting partially unfolded and misfolded conformations that promote aggregation into oligomers. The oligomers subsequently associate into protofibrils, which further associate into insoluble TTR amyloid fibrils and insoluble TTR amyloid deposits. Accordingly, non-native TTR forms include but are not limited to partially unfolded or misfolded TTR tetramer, partially unfolded or misfolded monomeric TTR, oligomeric TTR, TTR protofibrils, TTR fibrils, and TTR amyloid deposits. In some embodiments, non-native TTR may contain truncated TTR caused by proteolysis. In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention exhibit selective binding to monomeric and/or oligomeric TTR. Monomeric TTR is described herein. In some embodiments, the antibodies further exhibit selective binding to TTR protofibrils, TTR fibrils, TTR amyloid deposits, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">&#x201c;Oligomeric TTR&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to non-native TTR proteins formed by the association of more than 4 TTR monomers. In some embodiments, TTR oligomers are formed of 5-10 subunits, 7-20 subunits, 10-50 subunits, 30-100 subunits, or more than 100 subunits. In some embodiments, TTR oligomers comprise more than 100 subunits. In some embodiments, TTR oligomers comprise less than 8 subunits. In some embodiments, the TTR oligomers are formed of 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, or more subunits. In some embodiments, the TTR oligomers are pentamers, hexamers, heptamers, or octomers. In some embodiments, oligomeric TTR exhibits a molecular weight that is greater than 56 kD. In some embodiments, the subunits in the oligomeric TTR compose of mutant TTR. In some embodiments, the subunits in the said oligomers compose of wild-type TTR. In other embodiments, the subunits in the said oligomers compose of a mixture of mutant and wild-type TTR monomers or truncated monomers.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Amyloid deposits can be characterized as insoluble, fibrous protein aggregates. In some embodiments, the amyloid deposits exhibit beta sheet structure. In some embodiments, the amyloid deposits substantially comprise protein fibrils. Amyloid fibrils can be characterized as thread-like protein aggregates that are insoluble and resistant to protease activity. They comprise &#x3b2;-strands that run perpendicular to the fiber axis and form a cross &#x3b2;-sheet of indefinite length. &#x201c;Protofibrils&#x201d; can be characterized as elongated protein aggregates that are generally soluble.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">&#x201c;Physiologically relevant conditions&#x201d;, as used herein, generally refer to environmental conditions that do not promote protein denaturation. Physiologically relevant conditions can include in vivo conditions (e.g., physiological conditions), in vitro conditions wherein TTR is retained in a cellular milieu (e.g., live cell imaging), or in vitro conditions wherein TTR is isolated from a cellular milieu but remains in an environment that does not promote significant protein denaturation. Protein denaturation generally refers to a process in which proteins lose their quaternary, tertiary, and/or secondary structure which is present in a native state, generally, by application of a stressor. Therefore, physiologically relevant conditions can be generally characterized as lacking external stressors that induce protein denaturation.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">For example, the binding assays may be conducted under physiologically relevant buffer conditions. Generally, a physiological buffer contains a physiological concentration of salt and is adjusted to a neutral pH ranging from about 6.5 to about 7.8, and preferably from about 7.0 to about 7.5. A variety of physiological buffers is listed in Sambrook et al. (1989) supra and hence is not detailed herein.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Another exemplary stressor that can induce protein denaturation is non-physiological pH. Generally, non-physiological pH refers to either acidic or basic (i.e. &#x2014;non-neutral) pH. Acidic pH can be a pH less than about 7, less than about 6.5, less than about 6, less than about 5, or less than about 4. Exemplary acidic denaturants include but are not limited to acetic acid, citrate acid, trichloroacetic acid, sulfosalicylic acid. Basic pH can be greater than about 7.5, greater than about 8.0, or greater than about 8.5). Physiologically relevant pH conditions can be about pH 6-8, about pH 6.5-7.8, about pH 7.0-7.5.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Non-physiological salt concentrations represent another stressor that can promote protein denaturation. Some salts, such as ammonium sulfate, tend to stabilize protein structures and increase the melting temperature. Others, such as calcium chloride, destabilize proteins and lower the melting temperature and are referred to as chaotropic. Exemplary chaotropic salts include but are not limited to heavy metal salts, lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiOTD, lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF(6)), and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiNTf(2), Guanidinium chloride, magnesium chloride, lithium acetate. Exemplary physiological salt concentrations include salt concentrations of physiological buffers, described herein.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">High, non-physiological temperatures can also induce protein denaturation. Many proteins denature at about 41 degrees C. or higher. Physiologically relevant temperatures can include temperatures below 41 deg C., below 40 deg C., below 39 deg C., below 38 deg C. Furthermore, temperatures below freezing can also affect native protein structure. Physiologically relevant temperatures can include temperatures above 0 deg C., above 1 deg C., above 2 deg C., above 3 deg C., or about 4 deg C. or higher. In one embodiment, a physiologically relevant temperature ranges from about 4 deg C. to about 40 deg C.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Presence of chaotropic agent including but not limited to urea, guanidium hydrochloride, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and alcohols (e.g. ethanol) can also disrupt native non-covalent protein intramolecular interactions such as hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding. Thus, the presence of chaotropic agent is another example of a non-physiologically relevant condition.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Proteins can denature at interfaces. During the course of an immunoassay, several interfaces are formed that affect the structure and function of the biological components. An exemplary interface is the interface between a solid surface and a liquid solution. In some embodiments, proteins present at an interface (e.g., a solid/liquid interface) are in a non-physiologically relevant condition. For example, direct attachment of proteins to a solid surface (e.g., during a direct ELISA assay), can alter the conformation of proteins and induce denaturation, hence, may be considered as a non-physiologically relevant condition. Accordingly, an in vitro binding assay can be considered to be conducted under physiologically relevant conditions if more than 50% of proteins in a test sample are present in a liquid solution and not localized to a solid/liquid interface (e.g., not directly attached to a solid surface).</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In some embodiments, the antibodies bind to wild-type or mutant TTR. The term &#x201c;mutant TTR&#x201d; refers to any TTR protein species that is encoded by a TTR gene that harbors a mutation in the TTR gene. A mutant TTR protein may harbor a missense mutation in less than all of the subunits (some being wild type), in which a single nucleotide change in the TTR gene causes an amino acid substitution in the TTR amino acid sequence. A mutant TTR protein may harbor a frameshift mutation, e.g., a mutation that disrupts the reading frame of the gene resulting in a substantially different amino acid sequence as compared to wild-type TTR. Alternatively, a mutant TTR protein may harbor a nonsense mutation, resulting in a premature stop codon, which causes significant truncation of the protein product. In particular embodiments, the mutant TTR protein harbors a missense mutation. In particular, there are over 100 missense mutant forms of TTR known to be associated with amyloid disease. In some embodiments, the mutant TTR is a mutant TTR associated with an amyloid disease (amyloidogenic mutant TTR). In some embodiments, sporadic or familial amyloidogenic mutation is present on either a single allele (e.g., a heterozygous mutation) or both alleles (e.g., a homozygous mutation) of the TTR gene. In some embodiments, the amyloidogenic mutant TTR comprises a Cys10Arg, Leu12Pro, Asp18Glu, Asp18Gly, Asp18Asn, Val20Ile, Ser23Asn, Pro24Ser, Ala25Thr, Ala25Ser, Val28Met, Val30Met, Val30Ala, Val30Leu, Val30Gly, Val32Ala, Phe33Ile, Phe33Leu, Phe33Val, Phe33Cys, Arg34Thr, Arg34Gly, Lys35Asn, Lys35Thr, Ala36Pro, Asp38Ala, Asp38Val, Trp41Leu, Glu42Gly, Glu42Asp, Phe44Ser, Ala45Asp, Ala45Ser, Ala45Thr, Gly47Arg, Gly47Ala, Gly47Val, Gly47Glu, Thr49Ala, Thr49Ile, Thr49Pro, Ser50Arg, Ser50Ile, Glu51Gly, Ser52Pro, Gly53Glu, Gly53Ala, Glu54Gly, Glu54Lys, Glu54Leu, Leu55Arg, Leu55Pro, Leu55Gln, Leu55Glu, His56Arg, Gly57Arg, Leu58His, Leu58Arg, Thr59Lys, Thr60Ala, Glu61Lys, Glu61Gly, Phe64Leu, Phe64Ser, Gly67Glu, Ile68Leu, Tyr69His, Tyr69Ile, Lys70Asn, Val71Ala, Ile73Val, Ser77Phe, Ser77Tyr, Tyr78Phe, Ala81Val, Ala81Thr, Ile84Ser, Ile84Asn, Ile84Thr, His88Arg, Glu89Gln, Glu89Lys, His90Asp, Ala91Ser, Gln92Lys, Val94Ala, Ala97Gly, Ala97Ser, Ile107Val, Ile107Met, Ile107Phe, Ala109Ser, Leu111Met, Ser112Ile, Tyr114Cys, Tyr114His, Tyr116Ser, Ala120Ser, Val122Ile, DelVal122, Val122Ala, or Asn124Ser mutation. In other embodiments, the mutant TTR is not associated with an amyloid disease (non-amyloidogenic mutant TTR). In some embodiments, the non-amyloidogenic mutant TTR comprises a Gly6Ser, Met13Ile, Asp74His, His90Asn, Gly101Ser, Pro102Arg, Arg104Cys, Arg104His, Ala108Ala, Ala109Thr, Ala109Val, Thr119Met, or Pro125Ser mutation. In other embodiments, a mutant TTR may harbor more than one mutation. In particular embodiments, a mutant TTR may harbor two mutations, either on the same allele or on different alleles. A mutation may be any combination of the single mutations described herein. In some embodiments, the mutant TTR is a Gly6Ser/Val30Met, Gly6Ser/Phe33Ile, Gly6Ser/Ala45Asp, Gly6Ser/Ser77Tyr, Gly6Ser/Tyr114Cys, Gly6Ser/Thr119Met, Gly6Ser/Val122/Ala, His90Asn/Val30Met, His90Asn Glu42Gly, His90Asn/Thr119Met, Arg104His/Val30Met, or Thr119Met/Val30Met mutation.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">&#x201c;Amyloid disease carrier&#x201d;, as used herein, generally refers to a symptomatic subject carrying an amyloid disease or an asymptomatic subject carrying a gene mutation or known risk factor for developing an amyloid disease.

The moieties may be covalently linked, or conjugated, through a secondary reagent, such as a second antibody, protein A, or a biotin-avidin complex. Paramagnetic moieties can be conjugated to the antibody by means that are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Miltenyi et al.

In that manner, chimeric antibodies are prepared that retain the binding specificity of the original antibody.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">It is also understood that the polynucleotides embodied in the invention include those coding for functional equivalents and fragments thereof of the exemplified polypeptides. Functionally equivalent polypeptides include those that enhance, decrease or not significantly affect properties of the polypeptides encoded thereby. Functional equivalents may be polypeptides having conservative amino acid substitutions, analogs including fusions, and mutants.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, there can be considerable variation in nucleotides of the L and H sequences, as well as the heterodimerization sequences suitable for construction of the polynucleotide and vectors of the present invention. Sequence variants may have modified DNA or amino acid sequences, one or more substitutions, deletions, or additions, the net effect of which is to retain the desired antigen-binding activity. For instance, various substitutions can be made in the coding region that either do not alter the amino acids encoded or result in conservative changes. These substitutions are encompassed by the present invention. Conservative amino acid substitutions include substitutions within the following groups: glycine, alanine; valine, isoleucine, leucine; aspartic acid, glutamic acid; asparagine, glutamine; serine, threonine; lysine, arginine; and phenylalanine, tyrosine. While conservative substitutions do effectively change one or more amino acid residues contained in the polypeptide to be produced, the substitutions are not expected to interfere with the antigen-binding activity of the resulting antibodies to be produced. Nucleotide substitutions that do not alter the amino acid residues encoded are useful for optimizing gene expression in different systems. Suitable substitutions are known to those of skill in the art and are made, for instance, to reflect preferred codon usage in the expression systems.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Where desired, the recombinant polynucleotides may comprise heterologous sequences that facilitate detection of the expression and purification of the gene product. Examples of such sequences are known in the art and include those encoding reporter proteins such as beta-galactosidase, beta-lactamase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), luciferase, green fluorescent protein (GFP) and their derivatives. Other heterologous sequences that facilitate purification may code for epitopes such as Myc, HA (derived from influenza virus hemagglutinin), His-6 (SEQ ID NO: 17), FLAG, or the Fc portion of immunoglobulin, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and maltose-binding protein (MBP).</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">The polynucleotides can be conjugated to a variety of chemically functional moieties described above.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">The polynucleotides of the invention can comprise additional sequences, such as additional encoding sequences within the same transcription unit, controlling elements such as promoters, ribosome binding sites, and polyadenylation sites, additional transcription units under control of the same or a different promoter, sequences that permit cloning, expression, and transformation of a host cell, and any such construct as may be desirable to provide embodiments of this invention.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">The polynucleotides embodied in this invention can be obtained using chemical synthesis, recombinant cloning methods, PCR, or any combination thereof. Methods of chemical polynucleotide synthesis are well known in the art and need not be described in detail herein. One of skill in the art can use the sequence data provided herein to obtain a desired polynucleotide by employing a DNA synthesizer or ordering from a commercial service.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Polynucleotides comprising a desired sequence can be inserted into a suitable vector which in turn can be introduced into a suitable host cell for replication and amplification. Accordingly, the invention encompasses a variety of vectors comprising one or more of the polynucleotides of the present invention. Also provided is a selectable library of expression vectors comprising at least one vector encoding an invention antibody.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">Vectors can be any plasmid, virus, viral vector, or other vehicle known in the art that can be manipulated by insertion or incorporation of a nucleic acid. For example, &#x201c;cloning vectors&#x201d; can be employed for the purposes of genetic manipulation. For another example, &#x201c;expression vectors&#x201d; can be employed to transcribe or translate the inserted polynucleotide. Generally, expression vectors are useful for introducing nucleic acids, including a nucleic acid that encodes an antibody operably linked with an expression control element, and expressing the antibody in vitro (e.g., in solution or a solid phase), in cells, or in a subject in vivo.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">Viral vectors can be based on retroviral, adeno-associated virus (AAV), lentiviral, adenoviral, retrovirus, or rotaviral genomes, simian virus 40 (SV40) or bovine papilloma virus (Cone et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6349 (1984); Eukaryotic Viral Vectors, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Gluzman ed., 1982; Sarver et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 1:486 (1981). Additional viral vectors useful for expression include Norwalk virus, coronaviruses, paramyxo and rhabdoviruses, togavirus (e.g., sindbis virus and semliki forest virus), parvovirus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">Expression vectors can be designed for in vivo and ex vivo expression. One such mammalian expression vector is AAV (U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,090). AAV vectors have previously been shown to provide expression of Factor IX in humans and in mice at levels sufficient for therapeutic benefit (Kay et al., Nat. Genet. 24:257 (2000); Nakai et al., Blood 91:4600 (1998)). Adenoviral vectors (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,700,470, 5,731,172 and 5,928,944),) retroviral (e.g., lentivirus vectors are useful for infecting dividing as well as non-dividing cells and foamy viruses) vectors (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,820, 5,693,508, 5,665,577, 6,013,516 and 5,674,703 and WIPO publications WO92/05266 and WO92/14829), herpes simplex virus vectors (U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,979, and papilloma virus vectors (e.g., human and bovine papilloma virus) have all been employed in gene therapy (U.S. Pat. No. 5,719,054).</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">Vectors also include cytomegalovirus (CMV) based vectors (U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,063). Vectors that efficiently deliver genes to cells of the intestinal tract have been developed (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,821,235, 5,786,340 and 6,110,456).</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">A vector generally contains an origin of replication for propagation in a cell. Control elements, including expression control elements as set forth herein, present within a vector, can be included to facilitate transcription and translation.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">Suitable transcription or translational control sequences include but are not limited to replication origin, promoter, enhancer, repressor binding regions, transcription initiation sites, ribosome binding sites, translation initiation sites, and termination sites for transcription and translation.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">As used herein, a &#x201c;promoter&#x201d; is a DNA region capable of binding RNA polymerase and initiating transcription of a coding region located downstream (in the 3&#x2032; direction) from the promoter. The promoter can be constitutive or inducible. In general, the promoter sequence is bounded at its 3&#x2032; terminus by the transcription initiation site and extends upstream (5&#x2032; direction) to include the minimum number of bases or elements necessary to initiate transcription at levels detectable above background. Within the promoter sequence is a transcription initiation site, as well as protein binding domains responsible for the binding of RNA polymerase. Eukaryotic promoters can contain &#x201c;TATA&#x201d; boxes and &#x201c;CAT&#x201d; boxes.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">The choice of promoters will largely depend on the host cells in which the vector is introduced. For animal cells, a variety of robust promoters, both viral and non-viral promoters, are known in the art. Non-limiting representative viral promoters include CMV, the early and late promoters of SV40 virus, promoters of various types of adenoviruses (e.g. adenovirus 2) and adeno-associated viruses. It is also possible, and often desirable, to utilize promoters normally associated with a desired light or heavy chain gene, provided that such control sequences are compatible with the host cell system.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">Suitable promoter sequences for other eukaryotic cells include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, or other glycolytic enzymes, such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase. Other promoters, which have the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, and the aforementioned glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">In certain preferred embodiments, the vectors of the present invention use strong enhancer and promoter expression cassettes. Examples of such expression cassettes include the human cytomegalovirus immediately early (HCMV-IE) promoter (Boshart et al, Cell 41: 521, (1985)), the beta-actin promoter (Gunning et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 84: 5831), the histone H4 promoter (Guild et al. (1988), J Viral. 62: 3795), the mouse metallothionein promoter (McIvor et al. (1987), Mol, Cell. Biol. 7: 838), the rat growth hormone promoter (Millet et al. (1985), Mol. Cell Biol. 5: 431), the human adenosine deaminase promoter (Hantzapoulos et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 3519), the HSV tk promoter 25 (Tabin et al. (1982) Mol. Cell. Biol. 2: 426), the .alpha-1 antitrypsin enhancer (Peng et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 8146), and the immunoglobulin enhancer/promoter (Blankenstein et al. (1988) Nucleic Acid Res. 16: 10939), the SV40 early or late promoters, the Adenovirus 2 major late promoter, or other viral promoters derived from polyoma virus, bovine papilloma virus, or other retroviruses or adenoviruses. The promoter and enhancer elements of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes confer marked specificity to B lymphocytes (Banerji et al. (1983) Cell 33: 729; Gillies et al. (1983) Cell 33: 717; Mason et al. (1985) Cell 41: 479), while the elements controlling transcription of the B-globin gene function only in erythroid cells (van Assendelft et al. (1989) Cell 56:969).</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">Cell-specific or tissue-specific promoters may also be used. A vast diversity of tissue specific promoters have been described and employed by artisans in the field. Exemplary promoters operative in selective animal cells include hepatocyte-specific promoters and cardiac muscle specific promoters. Depending on the choice of the recipient cell types, those skilled in the art will know of other suitable cell-specific or tissue-specific promoters applicable for the construction of the expression vectors of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">Using well-known restriction and ligation techniques, appropriate transcriptional control sequences can be excised from various DNA sources and integrated in operative relationship with the intact selectable fusion genes to be expressed in accordance with the present invention.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">In constructing the subject vectors, the termination sequences associated with the exogenous sequences are also inserted into the 3&#x2032; end of the sequence desired to be transcribed to provide polyadenylation of the mRNA and/or transcriptional termination signal. The terminator sequence preferably contains one or more transcriptional termination sequences (such as polyadenylation sequences) and may also be lengthened by the inclusion of additional DNA sequence so as to further disrupt transcriptional read-through. Preferred terminator sequences (or termination sites) of the present invention have a gene that is followed by a transcription termination sequence, either its own termination sequence or a heterologous termination sequence. Examples of such termination sequences include stop codons coupled to various polyadenylation sequences that are known in the art, widely available, and exemplified below. Where the terminator comprises a gene, it can be advantageous to use a gene which encodes a detectable or selectable marker; thereby providing a means by which the presence and/or absence of the terminator sequence (and therefore the corresponding inactivation and/or activation of the transcription unit) can be detected and/or selected.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">Vectors can also include a selection marker. A &#x201c;selection marker&#x201d; is a gene that allows for the selection of cells containing the gene. &#x201c;Positive selection&#x201d; refers to a process whereby only cells that contain the selection marker will survive upon exposure to the positive selection. Drug resistance is one example of a positive selection marker; cells containing the marker will survive in culture medium containing the selection drug, and cells lacking the marker will die. Selection markers include, for example, drug resistance genes (e.g., neo, which confers resistance to G418; hygr, which confers resistance to hygromycin; and puro, which confers resistance to puromycin). Other positive selection marker genes include genes that allow the visual identification or screening of cells containing the marker. These genes include genes for fluorescent proteins (GFP and GFP-like chromophores, luciferase), the lacZ gene, the alkaline phosphatase gene, and surface markers such as CD8, among others. &#x201c;Negative selection&#x201d; refers to a process whereby cells containing a negative selection marker are killed upon exposure to an appropriate negative selection agent. For example, cells which contain the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene (Wigler et al., Cell 11:223 (1977)) are sensitive to the drug gancyclovir (GANC). Similarly, the gpt gene renders cells sensitive to 6-thioxanthine.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">The vectors embodied in this invention can be obtained using recombinant cloning methods and/or by chemical synthesis.

In some embodiments, the host cell is a stably or transiently transformed cell or progeny thereof into which a nucleic acid encoding an invention antibody or fragment thereof has been introduced by means of recombinant DNA technology in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo. In some embodiments, the transformed cell is propagated and the introduced nucleic acid transcribed, and/or encoded protein expressed. Transformed cells include, by way of non-limiting example, prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells such as bacteria, fungi, plant, insect, and animal (e.g., mammalian, including human) cells.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">The term &#x201c;transformed&#x201d;, as used herein, means a genetic change in a cell following incorporation of nucleic acid (e.g., a transgene) exogenous to the cell. Thus, a &#x201c;transformed cell&#x201d; is a cell into which, or a progeny of which a nucleic acid molecule has been introduced by means of recombinant DNA techniques. Cell transformation to produce host cells may be carried out as described herein or using any technique known in the art.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">Introduction of antibodies and nucleic acid encoding invention antibodies into target cells can be carried out by methods known in the art such as osmotic shock (e.g., calcium phosphate), microinjection, electroporation, cell fusion, etc. Introduction of nucleic acid and can also be accomplished using other techniques. By way of example only, a nucleic acid can be entrapped in microcapsules prepared by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, e.g., by the use of hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules, or poly (methylmethacrolate) microcapsules. Introduction of antibodies or nucleic acid encoding the same can also be delivered using a colloid drug delivery system. Colloidal delivery systems include, e.g., macromolecule complexes, nano-capsules, microspheres, beads, and lipid-based systems such as oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, piperazine based amphilic cationic lipids (described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,861,397), cationic lipid systems (described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,127), and liposomes, e.g., phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, lipofectin and DOTAP (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,844,904, 5,000,959, 4,863,740, 4,975,282). Other methods suitable for transformation of host cells are described herein.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">For most animal cells, any of the above-mentioned methods is suitable for vector delivery. Preferred animal cells are vertebrate cells, preferably mammalian cells, capable of expressing exogenously introduced gene products in large quantity, e.g. at the milligram level. Non-limiting examples of preferred cells are NIH3T3 cells, COS, HeLa, and CHO cells.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">The animal cells can be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium (MEM, Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, animal cells can be grown in a defined medium that lacks serum but is supplemented with hormones, growth factors or any other factors necessary for the survival and/or growth of a particular cell type. Whereas a defined medium supporting cell survival maintains the viability, morphology, capacity to metabolize and potentially, capacity of the cell to differentiate, a defined medium promoting cell growth provides all chemicals necessary for cell proliferation or multiplication. The general parameters governing mammalian cell survival and growth in vitro are well established in the art. Physicochemical parameters which may be controlled in different cell culture systems are, e.g., pH, pO<sub>2</sub>, temperature, and osmolarity. The nutritional requirements of cells are usually provided in standard media formulations developed to provide an optimal environment. Nutrients can be divided into several categories: amino acids and their derivatives, carbohydrates, sugars, fatty acids, complex lipids, nucleic acid derivatives and vitamins. Apart from nutrients for maintaining cell metabolism, most cells also require one or more hormones from at least one of the following groups: steroids, prostaglandins, growth factors, pituitary hormones, and peptide hormones to proliferate in serum-free media (Sato, G. H., et al. in &#x201c;Growth of Cells in Hormonally Defined Media&#x201d;, Cold Spring Harbor Press, N.Y., 1982). In addition to hormones, cells may require transport proteins such as transferrin (plasma iron transport protein), ceruloplasmin (a copper transport protein), and high-density lipoprotein (a lipid carrier) for survival and growth in vitro. The set of optimal hormones or transport proteins will vary for each cell type. Most of these hormones or transport proteins have been added exogenously or, in a rare case, a mutant cell line has been found which does not require a particular factor. Those skilled in the art will know of other factors required for maintaining a cell culture without undue experimentation.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">For plant cells, a variety of vector delivery techniques is available in the art. The host cells may be in the form of whole plants, isolated cells or protoplasts. Illustrative procedures for introducing vectors into plant cells include <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated plant transformation, protoplast transformation, gene transfer into pollen, injection into reproductive organs and injection into immature embryos. As is evident to one skilled in the art, each of these methods has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Thus, one particular method of introducing vectors into a particular plant species may not necessarily be the most effective for another plant species.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192"><i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated transfer is a widely applicable system for introducing vectors into plant cells because the vector can be introduced into whole plant tissues, bypassing the need for regeneration of an intact plant from a protoplast. The use of <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated expression vectors to introduce vector into plant cells is well known in the art. This technique makes use of a common feature of <i>Agrobacterium </i>which colonizes plants by transferring a portion of their DNA (the T-DNA) into a host cell, where it becomes integrated into nuclear DNA. The T-DNA is defined by border sequences which are 25 base pairs long, and any DNA between these border sequences is transferred to the plant cells as well. The insertion of a recombinant plant viral nucleic acid between the T-DNA border sequences results in transfer of the recombinant plant viral nucleic acid to the plant cells, where the recombinant plant viral nucleic acid is replicated, and then spreads systemically through the plant.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">Because not all plants are natural hosts for <i>Agrobacterium</i>, alternative methods such as transformation of protoplasts may be employed to introduce the subject vectors into plant host cells. For certain monocots, transformation of the plant protoplasts can be achieved using methods based on calcium phosphate precipitation, polyethylene glycol treatment, electroporation, and combinations of these treatments.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">In addition to protoplast transformation, particle bombardment is an alternative and convenient technique for delivering the invention vectors into a plant host cell. Specifically, the plant cells may be bombarded with microparticles coated with a plurality of the subject vectors. Bombardment with DNA-coated microprojectiles has been successfully used to produce stable transformants in both plants and animals (see, for example, Sanford et al. (1993) Methods in Enzymology, 217:483-509). Microparticles suitable for introducing vectors into a plant cell are typically made of metal, preferably tungsten or gold. These microparticles are available for example, from Bio-Rad (e.g., Bio-Rad's PDS-1000/He). Those skilled in the art will know that the particle bombardment protocol can be optimized for any plant by varying parameters such as He pressure, quantity of coated particles, distance between the macrocarrier and the stopping screen and flying distance from the stopping screen to the target.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">Vectors can also be introduced into plants by direct DNA transfer into pollen as described by Thou et al., Methods in Enzymology, 101:433 (1983); D. Hess, Intern Rev. Cytol., 107:367 (1987); Luo et al., Plant Mol. Biol. Reporter, 6:165 (1988). Alternatively, the vectors can be injected into reproductive organs of a plant as described by Pena et al., Nature, 325:274 (1987).</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">Other techniques for introducing nucleic acids into a plant cell include: (a) Hand Inoculations. Hand inoculations are performed using a neutral pH, low molarity phosphate buffer, with the addition of celite or carborundum (usually about 1%). One to four drops of the preparation is put onto the upper surface of a leaf and gently rubbed. (b) Mechanized Inoculations of Plant Beds. Plant bed inoculations are performed by spraying (gas-propelled) the vector solution into a tractor-driven mower while cutting the leaves. Alternatively, the plant bed is mowed and the vector solution sprayed immediately onto the cut leaves. (c) High Pressure Spray of Single Leaves. Single plant inoculations can also be performed by spraying the leaves with a narrow, directed spray (50 psi, 6-12 inches from the leaf) containing approximately 1% carborundum in the buffered vector solution. (d) Vacuum Infiltration. Inoculations may be accomplished by subjecting a host organism to a substantially vacuum pressure environment in order to facilitate infection.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">Other suitable host cells for cloning and expressing the subject vectors are prokaryotes and eukaryotic microbes such as fungi or yeast cells. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include bacteria including Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Representative members of this class of microorganisms are Enterobacteriaceae (e.g. <i>E. coli</i>), <i>Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella </i>(e.g. <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>), <i>Serratia </i>(e.g., <i>Sefratia marcescans</i>), <i>Shigella, Neisseria </i>(e.g. <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i>) as well as <i>Bacilli </i>(e.g. <i>Bacilli subtilis </i>and <i>Bacilli licheniformis</i>). Preferably, the host cell secretes minimal amounts of proteolytic fragments of the expressed Abus. Commonly employed fungi (including yeast) host cells are <i>S. cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis </i>(<i>K. lactis</i>), species of <i>Candida </i>including <i>C. albicans </i>and <i>C. glabrata, C. maltosa, C. utilis, C. stellatoidea, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalus, Neurospora crassas, Aspergillus nidulans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe </i>(<i>S. pombe</i>), <i>Pichia pastoris</i>, and <i>Yarowia lipolytica. </i></p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">The cells may be present in culture, a tissue or organ ex vivo, or in a subject in vivo. A progeny cell does not necessarily need to be identical to the parental cell, since there may be mutations that occur during replication.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">In some embodiments, the host cell is a hybridoma cell, e.g., a hybrid cell produced by the fusion of a B-lymphocyte producing an antibody of the invention with a myeloma cell. Such B-lymphocytes producing an invention antibody can be generated by, e.g., immunizing a test animal with an antigen as described herein and harvesting B-lymphocytes from the spleen of said immunized test animals. Fusion of B-lymphocytes with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas are known in the art and described in, e.g., Kohler et al., Nature 256:495 (1975), Making and Using Antibodies: A Practical Handbook (1st Ed., 2006). Selection of hybridomas for the desired binding characteristics are known in the art and described in, e.g., Kohler et al., Nature 256:495 (1975), Making and Using Antibodies: A Practical Handbook (1st Ed., 2006). A vast number of hybridoma cells producing an array of monoclonal antibodies may be obtained from public or private repositories. The largest depository agent is American Type Culture Collection, which offers a diverse collection of well-characterized hybridoma cell lines. In some embodiments the host cell is a hybridoma cell corresponding to ATCC deposit #PTA-120816 or PTA-120817.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">Once introduced into a suitable host cell, expression of the invention antibody can be determined using any nucleic acid or protein assay known in the art. For example, the presence of transcribed mRNA of a light or heavy chain of the antibody can be detected and/or quantified by conventional hybridization assays (e.g. Northern blot analysis), amplification procedures (e.g. RT-PCR), SAGE (U.S. Pat. No. 5,695,937, hereby incorporated by reference), and array-based technologies (see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,405,783, 5,412,087 and 5,445,934, hereby incorporated by reference), using probes complementary to any region of the polynucleotide.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">Expression of the vector can also be determined by examining the protein level of the antibody. A variety of techniques are available in the art for protein analysis. They include but are not limited binding assays, which are described herein, and SDS-PAGE analysis.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">Methods of Producing Antibodies</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">The antibodies of the invention can be produced using any methods known to one of skill in the art (see, e.g., Making and Using Antibodies: A Practical Handbook (1<sup>st </sup>Ed., 2006)) or as described herein.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">In some embodiments, the antibodies are generated by inoculating a test animal with an antigen polypeptide that comprises a portion of the TTR amino acid sequence. In some embodiments, the antigen is more accessible on monomeric and/or oligomeric TTR as compared to tetrameric TTR. Antigen accessibility can be ascertained by the formation of a complex between the antigen and the antibody. In some embodiments, formation of the complex is detected by a binding assay, e.g., an immunoassay. In some embodiments, the antigen comprises a plurality of consecutive amino acids between positions 1-100 of any wild-type or mutant TTR sequence. In some embodiments, the antigen comprises a plurality of consecutive amino acids between positions 5-90, 10-80, 20-70, or 30-66 of any wild-type or mutant TTR sequence. In other embodiments, the antigen comprises a plurality of consecutive amino acids between positions 60-127 of any wild-type or mutant TTR sequence. In other embodiments, the antigen comprises a plurality of consecutive amino acids between positions 70-127, 80-127, 90-127, 109-121, 100-127, 110-127, or 115-127 of any wild-type or mutant TTR sequence. In some embodiments, the antigen is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, or more than 20 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, the antigen is 3-7, 4-10, 7-15, 10-20, 15-30, 20-40, 30-60, or more than 60 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, the antigen is synthesized using standard solid phase chemistry. In some cases the antigen sequence is chosen based on the crystal structure of TTR. By way of example only, a TTR polypeptide fragment that comprises an amino acid sequence that is predicted to be buried in the TTR tetramer but exposed in the dissociated monomer may be chosen as the antigen. Epitope prediction tools are described herein.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">In some embodiments, the antigen may be a polypeptide designed with the aid of a design tool. Such tools include but are not limited to Expasy, which has aggregated a set of public tools under its ProtScale page, Antigen Profiler tool which enables a user to score individual peptide sequences based upon a relation epitope mapping database of previous immunogens used to generate antibodies. In some embodiments, the antigen may be designed to avoid certain amino acid sequences, such as, by way of example only, repeats of a single amino acid that are greater than 4 amino acids in length (e.g., RRRR (SEQ ID NO: 18)), Serine (S), Threonine (T), Alanine (A), and Valine (V) doublets, sequences starting or ending with Proline (P), or extremely hydrophobic peptides, such as, by way of non-limiting example, VALI (SEQ ID NO: 19)).</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">In some embodiments, small antigens (e.g., &#x3c;10 daltons) are conjugated or crosslinked to larger, immunogenic, carrier proteins to increase immunogenicity.

In some embodiments, small peptide antigens are delivered using liposomes as a carrier.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">The test animal can be any animal capable of generating an immune response to an antigen. Animal species frequently used for antibody production include chickens, goats, guinea pigs, hamsters, horses, mice, rats, rabbits, and sheep. One of skill in the art will understand that selection of the animal species may be based on a number of considerations, including but not limited to the amount of antibody needed, whether a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody is desired, the phylogenetic relationship between the donor species of the antigen and the species of the antibody producer (e.g., the more distant the phylogenetic relationship, the greater the potential for high titer antibody response) and the desired characteristics (e.g., class, subclass (isotype), titer) of the antibodies to be made.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">Monoclonal antibodies can be generated according to conventional techniques, such as the hybridoma method, described in, e.g., Kohler et al., Nature 256:495 (1975), Making and Using Antibodies: A Practical Handbook (1<sup>st </sup>Ed., 2006), recombinant DNA methods as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat.

Such detection and measurement can be used for a wide range of applications, such as, e.g., diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. For example, the detection methods may be used for the identification of subjects that have increased likelihood of developing a disease, for diagnosing a disease, for improving accuracy of disease diagnosis in a subject harboring one or more symptoms that are shared by a plurality of diseases, for identification of subjects for early treatment for said disease, for monitoring the progression of the disease, for assessing the pharmacodynamic properties of a therapeutic agent, for determining the effectiveness of an therapy targeting said disease, for drug screening purposes, for aiding in the selection of a therapeutic regimen for the disease, for evaluating disease prognosis in a subject, or as a therapeutic agent.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for detecting an increased likelihood of developing an amyloid disease symptom in a subject that has not developed said amyloid disease symptom, e.g., is asymptomatic. In a related embodiment, the invention provides a method for the diagnosis of a disease in a subject who has developed a symptom of the disease, wherein the symptom is associated with a plurality of diseases. By way of example only, accurate diagnosis of SSA can be a challenge, as histological and symptomatic hallmarks of SSA are shared by other types of systemic amyloidoses. By way of other example only, histological and symptomatic hallmarks of FAC are shared by other types of cardiomyopathies, making diagnosis of FAC a challenge. Accordingly, the methods and antibodies of the present invention can, for example, provide a useful biomarker that can distinguish a TTR-related amyloidosis characterized by a symptom in common with other diseases from said other diseases. In these and other methods, the method comprises measuring a level of non-native TTR in said subject using an antibody of the invention. In some embodiments, said subject is designated as having an increased likelihood of developing said amyloid disease symptom or of having an amyloid disease if said level is increased as compared to a level of non-native TTR measured in a control subject. In other embodiments, said subject carrying certain mutations (e.g. V30M mutation) is designated as having an increased likelihood of developing said amyloid disease symptom or of having an amyloid disease if said non-native TTR level is changed (increased or decreased) over 20% as compared to a level of non-native TTR measured in the same subject at a previous time point.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">Detection Methods:</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">In some embodiments, the methods of the present invention comprise detecting a level of non-native TTR in said subject.

In some embodiments, additives are added to a blocking buffer as well as the biological samples during the ELISA experiment to minimize non-specific binding or interferences including but not limited to heterophilic interactions. Such additives include carrier proteins (e.g. bovine serum albumin, casein), detergent (e.g. Tween-20), pooled normal plasma, polypropylene glycol, protein A/G, non-specific mouse antibodies, non-specific rabbit antibodies, as well as commercial sources of blocking reagents that serve such purposes.

Preservation of said tissue biopsy sample may involve removal of blood, e.g., by perfusion or rinsing. Preservation of tissue biopsy sample may also involve contacting said sample with a preservative, such as, .e.g., formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, one or more alcohols such as, e.g., ethanol, methanol, acetone, acetic acid, osmium tetroxide, potassium dichromate, chromic acid, potassium permangamate, picrates solution, or Hepes-glutamic acid buffer-mediated organic solvent protection effect fixative.

The control subject can be an individual known not to harbor an amyloid disease, or known not to harbor a TTR mutation. The control subject can be an age-matched control subject, e.g., within 0-10 years of age as said subject, or the control subject can be of a different age, e.g., a younger or older age than said subject. The control subject does not have to be a different individual from said subject, but may be the same subject at an earlier time point, e.g., within an age bracket that is not considered to be a risk factor for developing said disease or said disease symptom. Age brackets that can be considered as risk factors are described herein. In some embodiments, a level of non-native TTR in said subject may be compared to an expected level of a control subject. In some embodiments, said expected level is a non-detectable level. Accordingly, a subject can be designated as having a disease or having an increased likelihood of developing a disease if non-native TTR is detected in said subject. During the process of amyloidogenesis, the level of non-native TTR level as detected herein is influenced by multiple factors including but not limited to the formation of amyloid deposit, which may act either as a sink or reservoir for non-native TTR in the circulation. Therefore, the level of non-native TTR changes over time in an amyloid disease carrier.

In some embodiments, a detected fluctuation in the level of non-native TTR (e.g., a transient decrease or increase) indicates an increased likelihood of developing an amyloid disease symptom.

In some embodiments, the subject is an invertebrate, e.g., <i>C. elegans </i>or insect such as, e.g., <i>Drosophila melongaster. </i></p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">In some embodiments, the subject is suspected of having a disease or of having an increased likelihood of developing a disease symptom based on any combination of a number of risk factors, symptoms, assays, and tests described below. In related methods, the subject has been diagnosed with an amyloid disease and is undergoing an anti-aggregate therapy.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the presence or absence of risk factors, symptoms, assays, and tests described below may also be used as an aid to monitor the progression of the disease or to monitor a therapeutic effect of an agent.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">The subject may be considered to be at increased risk for having a disease or disease symptom and selected to undergo diagnostic testing using any of the methods of the invention, based on any combination of risk factors associated with the disease. The presence of any combination of risk factors described herein can be used to aid in the diagnosis of the subject based on use of any of the antibodies described herein. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that a greater number of risk factors that can be applied to a subject may correlate with greater risk of the subject developing the disease, however, a subject may be considered to be at increased risk for developing the disease based on even one of the risk factors described herein. A subject can also be selected to undergo diagnostic testing without presenting any of the risk factors described herein.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">In some embodiments, the subject is considered to be at increased risk for developing a disease upon detection of a TTR mutation in said subject. TTR mutations associated with increased risk for developing, e.g., FAP or FAC are described herein. One of skill in the art will understand that de novo (i.e. &#x2014;new) mutations of TTR may be discovered as being associated with a disease, and that detection of these new mutations in a subject may indicate that said subject is at increased risk for developing the disease or symptom(s) of the disease.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">Detection of a TTR mutation can be performed using any means known in the art and may include but are not limited to genotyping methods, exome or genome sequencing methods, including next-generation sequencing methods, or haplotype analysis.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">In some embodiments, mutant or variant TTR is detected by detecting a difference in TTR protein molecular weight as compared to wild-type TTR molecular weight. Differences in TTR molecular weight can be detected by any method described herein or known in the art, including but not limited to mass spectroscopy, electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy, size-based chromatography, and size-based electrophoresis. The difference in molecular weight can be a difference of about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 25, 30, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, or over 1000 daltons. The difference in molecular weight can be a difference of 1-10 daltons, 2-20 daltons, 5-30 daltons, 10-50 daltons, 20-100 daltons, 50-200 daltons, 100-500 daltons (0.5 kDa), 200-1000 daltons (1kDA), 0.5-5 kDa, or greater than 5 kDa. In some embodiments, the difference in molecular weight is equal to or greater than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, or more than 20 daltons. In preferred embodiments, the difference in molecular weight is equal to or greater than 10 daltons. In particular embodiments, the difference in molecular weight is an increase of 26 daltons as compared to wild-type TTR.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">In other embodiments, TTR mutations are detected by a change in isoelectric point as compared to wild-type TTR. Such changes in isoelectric point can be detected by any methods described herein or known in the art, such as, e.g., isoelectric focusing. In some embodiments, proteins in a biological sample obtained from a subject are subjected to size-based separation by electrophoresis, and are further separated according to isoelectric point by isoelectric focusing, e.g., by isoelectric focusing using a urea gradient.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">In some embodiments, the TTR mutation or variant is detected by analysis of a biological sample obtained from said subject. The biological sample can be a fluid sample, e.g., whole blood, plasma, serum, ascites, cerebrospinal fluid, sweat, urine, tears, saliva, buccal sample. The biological sample can also be a solid biological sample, e.g., feces or tissue biopsy.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">In some embodiments, the subject is considered to be at increased risk for developing a disease based on geographic/race factors. By way of example only, there is a high prevalence of TTR variants in Portugal, Sweden, and Japan. Therefore, a subject can be considered to be at increased risk for developing a disease if said subject is Portuguese, Swedish, or Japanese. By way of other example, there is a high prevalence of the V1221 TTR variant in Africans and African Americans as compared to Caucasians. The V1221 TTR variant is generally associated with FAC with little or no neuropathic symptoms. Therefore, a subject can be considered to be at increased risk for developing a disease, e.g., FAC, if said subject is of African descent. By way of other example only, a L111M TTR mutation has been reported in Danish kindred as being associated with exclusive cardiac involvement. Therefore, a subject can be considered to be at increased risk for developing a disease, e.g., a cardiac disease, if said subject is of Danish descent.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">In some embodiments, a subject is considered to be at increased risk for developing a disease or a disease symptom if the subject has a family history of a disease. In some embodiments, a family history of a disease involves any relative of the subject being diagnosed or suspected of having a disease. In some embodiments, a family history of a disease includes an immediate family member having been diagnosed or suspected of having a disease. In some embodiments, the family member diagnosed or suspected of having a disease is a parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, or family member from a yet even older generation. In some embodiments, the family member is a sibling. In particular embodiments, the sibling is an identical twin. In some embodiments, the family member is a son or daughter, or a grandchild or family member from a yet even younger generation. In some embodiments, the family member is outside the immediate family, e.g., a first cousin, a second cousin, a third cousin, an aunt, an uncle, a second or third aunt, a second or third uncle, a niece, a nephew, a second or third niece, a second or third nephew.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">In some embodiments, a subject is considered to be at increased risk for developing a disease or disease symptom based on age of said subject. For example, FAP typically strikes from 20-40 years of age. In some embodiments, a subject may be considered to be at increased risk for developing a symptom of FAP if said subject is between about 20-40 years of age. By way of other example, FAC typically strikes older individuals (e.g., 60 or above). In some embodiments, a subject is considered to be at increased risk for developing a symptom of FAC if said subject is about 40, 45, 50, 55, or 60 years or older. By way of yet another example, SSA is highly prevalent in individuals aged 80 or above. In some embodiments, a subject is considered to be at increased risk for developing a symptom of SSA if said subject is about 60, 65, 70, 75, or 80 years of age or older.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">In some cases, subjects with FAP or FAC present symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome prior to developing polyneuropathy or cardiomyopathy symptoms. Therefore, in some embodiments, a subject is considered to be at increased risk for developing a symptom of FAP or FAC if said subject exhibits a symptom of carpal tunnel syndrome. Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include, but are not limited to pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the hand or fingers.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">Symptoms</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">In some embodiments, said subject has suffered or is suffering from a disease symptom. In some cases, symptoms of a disease can be ascertained by a physical exam, subject self-report, neurological exam, medical history, electrophysiological test, lab assay, or imaging. In some cases, a physical exam or medical history will include an assessment or history of symptoms. In some cases, the neurological exam will include an assessment of the patient's vision, reflexes, balance, coordination, and/or muscle strength. Such laboratory tests can include tests of nerve function, e.g., electromyography with nerve conduction studies. Described herein are exemplary diseases and characteristic symptoms of said diseases. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that symptoms of a disease can manifest in a wide variety of ways and that the symptoms described herein for each disease is not meant to be an exhaustive list of symptoms.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">In some embodiments, the symptom of the disease is a symptom characteristic of FAP. FAP is a progressive degenerative disease that typically strikes between age 20-40 and causes progressive peripheral nerve degeneration. Symptoms of FAP can be due to sensory and/or autonomic nerve dysfunction. Sensorimotor symptoms of FAP can begin in the lower extremities of the subject and ascend laterally, and can include but are not limited to polyneuropathy, impaired sensation, e.g., impaired pain sensation, impaired temperature sensation, impaired touch sensation (e.g., numbness), or painful parasthesias (i.e. &#x2014;unusual sensations such as, e.g., pins and needles sensation), balance difficulties, difficulty walking, Symptoms of autonomic nerve dysfunction can include, but are not limited to nausea, vomiting, constipation, urinary incontinence or urinary retention, nephropathy, weight loss (e.g., wasting away), sweating abnormalities, e.g., inability to sweat, sexual dysfunction (e.g., impotence), a high blood prealbumin level, foot ulcers, diarrhea, carpal tunnel syndrome, delayed gastric emptying, and orthostatic hypotension. As the disease progresses, symptoms can include central nervous system manifestations such as, e.g., hydrocephalus, dementia, psychosis, seizures, visual impairment, ataxia and cardiomyopathy.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">In some embodiments, the symptom of the disease is characteristic of a leptomeningeal form of amyloidosis. The leptomeningeal form generally spares sensory and autonomic function, however, amyloid deposits on CNS tissues can cause symptoms such as, by way of non-limiting example only, hydrocephalus, seizures, ataxia, dementia, psychosis, motor impairment, and/or intracranial hemorrhage.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">Methods of assessing one or more symptoms of FAP are known in the art and include, the Neuropathy Impairment Score-Lower Limbs (NIS-LL), which quantifies motor, sensory, and reflex functions in the lower limbs. Lower limb motor and sensory impairment are another exemplary symptomatic hallmark of early-stage FAP.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">Other tests can involve skin biopsy to evaluate cutaneous nerve innervations, or nerve and muscle biopsy. Such tests can detect degeneration of affected nerves, e.g., axonal degeneration.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">In other embodiments, the symptom of the disease is characteristic of FAC (familial amyloid cardiomyopathy). Cardiomyopathy generally refers to a deterioration of heart muscle (i.e. &#x2014;myocardium) function. Said deterioration may occur for any reason. Cardiomyopathy can result in heart failure. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy include, e.g., dyspnea (i.e. &#x2014;breathlessness), peripheral edema (i.e. &#x2014;swelling of the legs), irregular heart beat. In some cases, FAC symptoms are preceded by carpal tunnel syndrome. Subjects with cardiomyopathy are at increased risk for congestive heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Many FAC patients also exhibit polyneurophy and autonomic nervous system dysfunction.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">Symptoms of FAC may be ascertained by, e.g., patient self-report, clinical examination, and/or laboratory tests. Such laboratory tests can include echocardiography, ECG, or in vivo imaging, e.g., MRI.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">In some cases, onset of FAC symptoms occurs around or after age 60. Symptoms of FAC may include the presence of conduction system disease (e.g., sinus node or atrioventricular node dysfunction) congestive heart failure, shortness of breath, peripheral edema, syncope, exertional dyspnea, generalized fatigue, or heart block. In some embodiments, symptoms of FAC include a low ECG voltage, axis deviation, bundle branch block, AV block, and atrial fibrillation.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">In other embodiments, the symptom of the disease is characteristic of SSA. SSA symptoms include, e.g., include congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and conduction defects, and may include one or more symptoms of FAC, described herein.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">In other embodiments, the symptom of the disease is characteristic of familial oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis. Familial oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis symptoms include, e.g., central nervous system dysfunction, brain hemorrhage, vision impairment, nystagmus, dementia, seizures, coma, stroke, headache, ataxia, tremor, deafness, dysarthria, and spasticity.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">Symptoms of any of the diseases described herein can also include the presence of amyloid deposits in affected tissue (e.g., nerves, leptomeningeal blood vessels, brainstem, spinal cord, eye, fat pad, and heart tissue). By way of example only, familial amyloid neuropathy progresses, amyloid deposits can be detected in other organs and organ systems such as, e.g., the heart, kidneys, salivary gland and digestive tract. Amyloid deposition in these organs can worsen and cause dysfunction of these organ systems, such as, e.g., infectious disease, heart failure, and renal insufficiency. In some embodiments, the presence of amyloid deposits in nerves or other tissue can be detected using any method known in the art or described herein. Such methods include, by way of non-limiting example only, staining a biological sample obtained from a subject with an amyloid-specific dye, or in vivo imaging of a live subject with an amyloid-specific imaging agent.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">Amyloid-specific dyes include, e.g., Congo Red, thioflavin S, thioflavin T, curcumin, acridine orange, fluorine, DDNP, (trans, trans)-1-bromo-2,5-bis-(3-hydroxycarbonyl4-hydroxy)-styrylbenzene (BSB), chyrsamine G, and any analogs and derivatives thereof. Congo red stained amyloid is generally characterized by a dichroic appearance exhibiting a yellow-green polarization color, resulting from the beta-pleated sheet structure of the amyloid. Further description of the biochemistry and histochemistry of amyloid can be found in Glenner, G., N. Eng. J. Med., 302: 1333 (1980).</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254">Amyloid-specific imaging agents include, e.g., radiopharmaceutical imaging agents such as but not limited to radiolabeled flutemetamol, florbetapir, and florbetaben.

By way of example only, dosage of an anti-aggregate agent can be titrated to achieve a reduction of non-native TTR at a desired rate. By way of example only, if during a course of administration of an anti-aggregate agent, the level of non-native TTR decreases only slightly (e.g., by less than 10%) or decreases slowly over time (e.g., by less than 10% over more than a month), the dosage of said anti-aggregate agent can be increased. Alternatively, said anti-aggregate agent can be administered more frequently. By way of other example only, if during a course of administration of an anti-aggregate agent, a subject experiences a negative side effect of said administration, and the level of non-native TTR decreases rapidly (e.g., by over 50% in less than 1 week), dosage of said agent can be reduced in order to reduce negative side effects in said subject while still effecting a decrease in the level of non-native TTR in said subject, possibly at a slower rate. By way of other example, if during a course of administration of an anti-aggregate agent, the level of non-native TTR does not decrease in said subject, dosage of said agent may be increased to effect a decrease in the level of non-native TTR in said subject. In one embodiment, dosage of said anti-aggregate agent is increased if said detected level is increased by 20% or more as compared to a level measured at an earlier time point.

TTR was eluted with a linear gradient of 50-350 mM NaCl in 1.5 column volumes followed by a 350 mM NaCl wash for 1.5 column volumes. Fractions containing TTR (the major peak in all cases) were pooled, concentrated, and further purified on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.) in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4) at 4&#xb0; C., in order to remove any soluble TTR aggregates. The identity of each purified TTR variant was confirmed by its mass, determined by electrospray LC/MS on a HP Series 1100-MSD liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.). Concentrations of TTR solutions are expressed in micromolar (&#x3bc;M) units and were determined spectrophotometrically, using an &#x3b5;280 of 1.88&#xd7;104 M-1 cm-1. A typical purification yields 60-100 mg of tetrameric TTR from 2 L of cell culture. All TTR solutions were stored at 4&#xb0; C. and were used within a week of purification.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0312">M-TTR was purified according to the above procedure, with slight modifications to the ammonium fractionation step: A 25-90% ammonium sulfate pellet was obtained, resuspended, and dialyzed in 3,500 MWCO Snakeskin dialysis tubing (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Ill.). The typical yield is 40-60 mg of M-TTR from 2 L of cell culture; M-TTR thus obtained is &#x3e;95% monomeric.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0313">Peptide Immunogen Design &#x26; Synthesis</p><p id="p-0315" num="0314">Synthetic polypeptide fragments of the human transthyretin proteins and the corresponding immunogenicity-enhancing conjugates were also generated as antigens for antibody production. Normally folded TTR adopts tetrameric conformation in solution. Pymol (Schrodinger, USA) was used to calculate and visualize solvent exposure of all amino acid side-chains of TTR based on the crystal structure of tetrameric TTR (PBD 2QGB). A polypeptide (ALA-ALA-LEU-LEU-SER-PRO-TYR-SER-TYR-SER-THR-THR-ALA-VAL (SEQ ID NO: 20)) corresponding to part of the G-strand and H-strand on TTR (amino acids 108-121) was identified as solvent inaccessible when TTR is folded as a tetramer and only becomes exposed when the tetramer dissociates and/or misfolds, as in the cases of the various non-native intermediate conformations leading to TTR amyloidogenesis. The peptide was synthesized using standard solid phase chemistry. A Cysteine residue was added to the C-terminus of the peptide to facilitate conjugation.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 2.

For example, mouse monoclonal antibody MFD102 recognizes peptide sequence ADDTWEPFASGKT (SEQ ID NO: 14), the underlined amino acids are unique to this peptide and do not exist in the neighboring peptides used for epitope mapping in this invention. The second unique non-native epitope corresponds to peptide sequence TSESGELHGLTTE (SEQ ID NO: 15), which is exemplified by mouse monoclonal antibody MFD108. These two epitopes reside on C-strand and D-strand in the TTR structure, respectively. Although C- and D-strands are located on the surface of the tetrameric TTR based on its crystal structure, the binding behavior of MFD102 and MFD108 suggests that the specific linear epitopes as identified in this invention represent different structural epitopes as compared to the native TTR structure. Interestingly, many deleterious TTR mutations reside around this region, such as L55P TTR (Lashuel, et al. Biochemistry. 1999 Oct. 12; 38(41):13560-73). It is likely that tetramer dissociation and oligomerization cause subtle unwinding and conformational changes around this region, rendering these linear structural epitopes accessible to antibodies such as MFD102 and MFD108.

While V30M and V1221 mutations are commonly associated with TTR-related amyloidoses, other rare mutations (including but not limited to mutations described herein) are associated with amyloidoses related to, e.g., cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy. To determine whether the subject antibodies detect non-native TTR in subjects with rare TTR mutations, plasma samples were collected from a 61 year old female cardiomyopathy patient heterozygous for a E89Q TTR mutation, undergoing treatment with a TTR kinetic stabilizer (n=1), a 57 year old male cardiomyopathy patient heterozygous for a T60A mutation, undergoing treatment with a 11K kinetic stabilizer (n=1), a 55 year old female cardiomyopathy patient heterozygous for a T59K mutation (n=1), 53 year old female cardiomyopathy patient heterozygous for a V30G mutation, undergoing treatment with a TTR kinetic stabilizer (n=1), and age-matched control subjects (n=10, 5 male and 5 female).

To determine the effects of tafamidis administration on non-native TTR in heterozygous V30M FAP patients, subjects were administered 20 mg/day tafamidis for 6 months. Plasma was collected from FAP patients before treatment, after 3 months of tafamidis treatment, and after 6 months of tafamidis treatment. Samples were collected and assayed for non-native TTR as described herein (see, e.g., Example 10). Non-native TTR levels were determined by comparison to a non-native TTR standard curve (data not shown). Non-native TTR standards were prepared as described in Example 2.1. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> depicts results from the assay.

By contrast, by 3 months of treatment subjects 62 and 81 exhibited similar or increased levels of non-native TTR as compared to pre-treatment levels.

Furthermore, an additional 20 patients were treated with tafamidis 20 mg/day for greater than 24 months (e.g., long-term treatment group). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> depicts results from the study. All V30M subjects (asymptomatic, symptomatic, and tafamidis-treated) exhibited detectable levels of non-native TTR, while age-matched controls exhibited no detectable levels of non-native TTR. These results indicate that the non-native TTR assay described herein is useful for early identification of FAP patients (e.g., for early identification of asymptomatic FAP patients). Furthermore, symptomatic FAP patients exhibited a marked increase in non-native TTR levels as compared to asymptomatic carriers. These results indicate that the non-native TTR assay can be used to biochemically differentiate symptomatic from asymptomatic patient groups. In addition, patients treated with tafamidis for 3, 6, 12, or over 24 months exhibited a reduction in non-native TTR levels, with the long-term treatment group exhibiting the greatest reduction in non-native TTR levels. This data indicates that the non-native TTR assay can be used to monitor response to TTR drug treatment.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">Example 15: Chemiluminescent Assay for Non-Native TTR</heading><p id="p-0378" num="0377">Plasma samples from drug-na&#xef;ve, symptomatic male and female heterozygous V30M TTR FAP patients (N=20) and age matched controls (N=12) were drawn by venipuncture into BD Vacutainer Cell Preparation Tubes (CPT) containing sodium citrate/Ficoll (Becton Dickinson #362782).
