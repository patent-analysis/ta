        <p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to antigen binding proteins that bind to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and methods of using and making the antigen binding proteins.</p>
        <heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS</heading>
        <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease involved in regulating the levels of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein (Horton et al., 2007; Seidah and Prat, 2007). In vitro experiments have shown that adding PCSK9 to HepG2 cells lowers the levels of cell surface LDLR (Benjannet et al., 2004; Lagace et al., 2006; Maxwell et al., 2005; Park et al., 2004). Experiments with mice have shown that increasing PCSK9 protein levels decreases levels of LDLR protein in the liver (Benjannet et al., 2004; Lagace et al., 2006; Maxwell et al., 2005; Park et al., 2004), while PCSK9 knockout mice have increased levels of LDLR in the liver (Rashid et al., 2005). Additionally, various human PCSK9 mutations that result in either increased or decreased levels of plasma LDL have been identified (Kotowski et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2006). PCSK9 has been shown to directly interact with the LDLR protein, be endocytosed along with the LDLR, and co-immunofluoresce with the LDLR throughout the endosomal pathway (Lagace et al., 2006). Degradation of the LDLR by PCSK9 has not been observed and the mechanism through which it lowers extracellular LDLR protein levels is uncertain.</p>
        <p id="p-0007" num="0006">PCSK9 is a prohormone-proprotein convertase in the subtilisin (S8) family of serine proteases (Seidah et al., 2003). Humans have nine prohormone-proprotein convertases that can be divided between the S8A and S8B subfamilies (Rawlings et al., 2006). Furin, PC1/PC3, PC2, PACE4, PC4, PC5/PC6 and PC7/PC8/LPC/SPC7 are classified in subfamily S8B. Crystal and NMR structures of different domains from mouse furin and PC1 reveal subtilisin-like pro- and catalytic domains, and a P domain directly C-terminal to the catalytic domain (Henrich et al., 2003; Tangrea et al., 2002). Based on the amino acid sequence similarity within this subfamily, all seven members are predicted to have similar structures (Henrich et al., 2005). SKI-1/S1P and PCSK9 are classified in subfamily S8A. Sequence comparisons with these proteins also suggest the presence of subtilisin-like pro- and catalytic domains (Sakai et al., 1998; Seidah et al., 2003; Seidah et al., 1999). In these proteins the amino acid sequence C-terminal to the catalytic domain is more variable and does not suggest the presence of a P domain.</p>
        <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Prohormone-proprotein convertases are expressed as zymogens and they mature through a multi step process. The function of the pro-domain in this process is two-fold. The pro-domain first acts as a chaperone and is required for proper folding of the catalytic domain (Ikemura et al., 1987). Once the catalytic domain is folded, autocatalysis occurs between the pro-domain and catalytic domain. Following this initial cleavage reaction, the pro-domain remains bound to the catalytic domain where it then acts as an inhibitor of catalytic activity (Fu et al., 2000). When conditions are correct, maturation proceeds with a second autocatalytic event at a site within the pro-domain (Anderson et al., 1997). After this second cleavage event occurs the pro-domain and catalytic domain dissociate, giving rise to an active protease.</p>
        <p id="p-0009" num="0008">Autocatalysis of the PCSK9 zymogen occurs between Gln152 and Ser153 (VFAQISIP) (Naureckiene et al., 2003), and has been shown to be required for its secretion from cells (Seidah et al., 2003). A second autocatalytic event at a site within PCSK9's pro-domain has not been observed. Purified PCSK9 is made up of two species that can be separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE; the pro-domain at 17 Kd, and the catalytic plus C-terminal domains at 65 Kd. PCSK9 has not been isolated without its inhibitory pro-domain, and measurements of PCSK9's catalytic activity have been variable (Naureckiene et al., 2003; Seidah et al., 2003).</p>

        <p id="p-0163" num="0162">Antigen binding proteins (such as antibodies and functional binding fragments thereof) that bind to PCSK9 are disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins bind to PCSK9 and prevent PCSK9 from functioning in various ways. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins block or reduce the ability of PCSK9 to interact with other substances. For example, in some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to PCSK9 in a manner that prevents or reduces the likelihood that PCSK9 will bind to LDLR. In other embodiments, antigen binding proteins bind to PCSK9 but do not block PCSK9's ability to interact with LDLR. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins are human monoclonal antibodies.</p>
        <p id="p-0164" num="0163">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in light of the present disclosure, altering the interactions between PCSK9 and LDLR can increase the amount of LDLR available for binding to LDL, which in turn decreases the amount of serum LDL in a subject, resulting in a reduction in the subject's serum cholesterol level. As such, antigen binding proteins to PCSK9 can be used in various methods and compositions for treating subjects with elevated serum cholesterol levels, at risk of elevated serum cholesterol levels, or which could benefit from a reduction in their serum cholesterol levels. Thus, various methods and techniques for lowering, maintaining, or preventing an increase in serum cholesterol are also described herein. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein allows for binding between PCSK9 and LDLR, but the antigen binding protein prevents or reduces the adverse activity of PCSK9 on LDLR. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein prevents or reduces the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR.</p>
        <p id="p-0165" num="0164">For convenience, the following sections generally outline the various meanings of the terms used herein. Following this discussion, general aspects regarding antigen binding proteins are discussed, followed by specific examples demonstrating the properties of various embodiments of the antigen binding proteins and how they can be employed.</p>

All documents, or portions of documents, cited in this application, including but not limited to patents, patent applications, articles, books, and treatises, are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety for any purpose. As utilized in accordance with the present disclosure, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:</p>
        <p id="p-0169" num="0168">
            The term &#x201c;proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9&#x201d; or &#x201c;PCSK9&#x201d; refers to a polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or 3 or fragments thereof, as well as related polypeptides, which include, but are not limited to, allelic variants, splice variants, derivative variants, substitution variants, deletion variants, and/or insertion variants including the addition of an N-terminal methionine, fusion polypeptides, and interspecies homologs. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 polypeptide includes terminal residues, such as, but not limited to, leader sequence residues, targeting residues, amino terminal methionine residues, lysine residues, tag residues and/or fusion protein residues. &#x201c;PCSK9&#x201d; has also been referred to as FH3, NARC1, HCHOLA3, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, and neural apoptosis regulated convertase 1. The PCSK9 gene encodes a proprotein convertase protein that belongs to the proteinase K subfamily of the secretory subtilase family. The term &#x201c;PCSK9&#x201d; denotes both the proprotein and the product generated following autocatalysis of the proprotein. When only the autocatalyzed product is being referred to (such as for an antigen binding protein that selectively binds to the cleaved PCSK9), the protein can be referred to as the &#x201c;mature,&#x201d; &#x201c;cleaved&#x201d;, &#x201c;processed&#x201d; or &#x201c;active&#x201d; PCSK9. When only the inactive form is being referred to, the protein can be referred to as the &#x201c;inactive&#x201d;, &#x201c;pro-form&#x201d;, or &#x201c;unprocessed&#x201d; form of PCSK9. The term PCSK9 as used herein also includes naturally occurring alleles, such as the mutations D374Y, S127R and F216L. The term PCSK9 also encompasses PCSK9 molecules incorporating post-translational modifications of the PCSK9 amino acid sequence, such as PCSK9 sequences that have been glycosylated, PEGylated, PCSK9 sequences from which its signal sequence has been cleaved, PCSK9 sequence from which its pro domain has been cleaved from the catalytic domain but not separated from the catalytic domain (e.g.,
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>
            ).
        </p>
        <p id="p-0170" num="0169">
            The term &#x201c;PCSK9 activity&#x201d; includes any biological effect of PCSK9. In certain embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to interact or bind to a substrate or receptor. In some embodiments, PCSK9 activity is represented by the ability of PCSK9 to bind to a LDL receptor (LDLR). In some embodiments, PCSK9 binds to and catalyzes a reaction involving LDLR. In some embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to alter (e.g., reduce) the availability of LDLR. In some embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to increase the amount of LDL in a subject. In some embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to decrease the amount of LDLR that is available to bind to LDL. In some embodiments, &#x201c;PCSK9 activity&#x201d; includes any biological activity resulting from PCSK9 signaling. Exemplary activities include, but are not limited to, PCSK9 binding to LDLR, PCSK9 enzyme activity that cleaves LDLR or other proteins, PCSK9 binding to proteins other than LDLR that facilitate PCSK9 action, PCSK9 altering APOB secretion (Sun X-M et al, &#x201c;Evidence for effect of mutant PCSK9 on apoliprotein B secretion as the cause of unusually severe dominant hypercholesterolemia, Human Molecular Genetics 14: 1161-1169, 2005 and Ouguerram K et al, &#x201c;Apolipoprotein B100 metabolism in autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemia related to mutations in PCSK9, Arterioscler thromb Vasc Biol. 24: 1448-1453, 2004), PCSK9's role in liver regeneration and neuronal cell differentiation (Seidah N G et al, &#x201c;The secretory proprotein convertase neural apoptosis-regulated convertase 1 (NARC-1): Liver regeneration and neuronal differentiation&#x201d; PNAS 100: 928-933, 2003), and PCSK9s role in hepatic glucose metabolism (Costet et al., &#x201c;Hepatic PCSK9 expression is regulated by nutritional status via insulin and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c&#x201d;

        <p id="p-0171" num="0170">The term &#x201c;hypercholesterolemia,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a condition in which cholesterol levels are elevated above a desired level. In some embodiments, this denotes that serum cholesterol levels are elevated. In some embodiments, the desired level takes into account various &#x201c;risk factors&#x201d; that are known to one of skill in the art (and are described or referenced herein).</p>
        <p id="p-0172" num="0171">The term &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d; or &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; includes both single-stranded and double-stranded nucleotide polymers. The nucleotides comprising the polynucleotide can be ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide. Said modifications include base modifications such as bromouridine and inosine derivatives, ribose modifications such as 2&#x2032;,3&#x2032;-dideoxyribose, and internucleotide linkage modifications such as phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phoshoraniladate and phosphoroamidate.</p>
        <p id="p-0173" num="0172">The term &#x201c;oligonucleotide&#x201d; means a polynucleotide comprising 200 or fewer nucleotides. In some embodiments, oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in length. In other embodiments, oligonucleotides are 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 to 40 nucleotides in length. Oligonucleotides can be single stranded or double stranded, e.g., for use in the construction of a mutant gene. Oligonucleotides can be sense or antisense oligonucleotides.

The nature of such control sequences can depend upon the host organism. In particular embodiments, control sequences for prokaryotes can include a promoter, a ribosomal binding site, and a transcription termination sequence. For example, control sequences for eukaryotes can include promoters comprising one or a plurality of recognition sites for transcription factors, transcription enhancer sequences, and transcription termination sequence. &#x201c;Control sequences&#x201d; can include leader sequences and/or fusion partner sequences.</p>

The term also includes amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acids are chemical analogs of a corresponding naturally-occurring amino acid and polymers. The terms &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; specifically encompass PCSK9 antigen binding proteins, antibodies, or sequences that have deletions from, additions to, and/or substitutions of one or more amino acid of antigen-binding protein. The term &#x201c;polypeptide fragment&#x201d; refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal deletion, a carboxyl-terminal deletion, and/or an internal deletion as compared with the full-length native protein. Such fragments can also contain modified amino acids as compared with the native protein. In certain embodiments, fragments are about five to 500 amino acids long. For example, fragments can be at least 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 20, 50, 70, 100, 110, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, or 450 amino acids long. Useful polypeptide fragments include immunologically functional fragments of antibodies, including binding domains. In the case of a PCSK9-binding antibody, useful fragments include but are not limited to a CDR region, a variable domain of a heavy and/or light chain, a portion of an antibody chain or just its variable region including two CDRs, and the like.</p>

Typically, an &#x201c;isolated protein&#x201d; constitutes at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 25%, or at least about 50% of a given sample. Genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA or other RNA, of synthetic origin, or any combination thereof can encode such an isolated protein.

            The term &#x201c;identity&#x201d; refers to a relationship between the sequences of two or more polypeptide molecules or two or more nucleic acid molecules, as determined by aligning and comparing the sequences. &#x201c;Percent identity&#x201d; means the percent of identical residues between the amino acids or nucleotides in the compared molecules and is calculated based on the size of the smallest of the molecules being compared. For these calculations, gaps in alignments (if any) are preferably addressed by a particular mathematical model or computer program (i.e., an &#x201c;algorithm&#x201d;). Methods that can be used to calculate the identity of the aligned nucleic acids or polypeptides include those described in

            In calculating percent identity, the sequences being compared are typically aligned in a way that gives the largest match between the sequences. One example of a computer program that can be used to determine percent identity is the GCG program package, which includes GAP (Devereux et al., 1984,
            <i>Nucl. Acid Res. </i>
            12:387; Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.). The computer algorithm GAP is used to align the two polypeptides or polynucleotides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined. The sequences are aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acid or nucleotide (the &#x201c;matched span&#x201d;, as determined by the algorithm). A gap opening penalty (which is calculated as 3&#xd7; the average diagonal, wherein the &#x201c;average diagonal&#x201d; is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the &#x201c;diagonal&#x201d; is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually 1/10 times the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as PAM 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. In certain embodiments, a standard comparison matrix (see, Dayhoff et al., 1978,
            <i>Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure </i>
            5:345-352 for the PAM 250 comparison matrix; Henikoff et al., 1992,

In certain embodiments, derivatives comprise covalent modifications, including, but not limited to, chemical bonding with polymers, lipids, or other organic or inorganic moieties. In certain embodiments, a chemically modified antigen binding protein can have a greater circulating half-life than an antigen binding protein that is not chemically modified. In certain embodiments, a chemically modified antigen binding protein can have improved targeting capacity for desired cells, tissues, and/or organs. In some embodiments, a derivative antigen binding protein is covalently modified to include one or more water soluble polymer attachments, including, but not limited to, polyethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene glycol, or polypropylene glycol. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835, 4,496,689, 4,301,144, 4,670,417, 4,791,192 and 4,179,337. In certain embodiments, a derivative antigen binding protein comprises one or more polymer, including, but not limited to, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, dextran, cellulose, or other carbohydrate based polymers, poly-(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)-polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol homopolymers, a polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymer, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol) and polyvinyl alcohol, as well as mixtures of such polymers.</p>

            Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed &#x201c;peptide mimetics&#x201d; or &#x201c;peptidomimetics.&#x201d; Fauchere, J., Adv. Drug Res., 15:29 (1986); Veber &#x26; Freidinger, TINS, p. 392 (1985); and Evans et al., J. Med. Chem., 30:1229 (1987), which are incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides can be used to produce a similar therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from: &#x2014;CH

            SO&#x2014;, by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) can be used in certain embodiments to generate more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation can be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch, Ann. Rev. Biochem., 61:387 (1992), incorporated herein by reference for any purpose); for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.

        <p id="p-0216" num="0215">The term &#x201c;naturally occurring&#x201d; as used throughout the specification in connection with biological materials such as polypeptides, nucleic acids, host cells, and the like, refers to materials which are found in nature or a form of the materials that is found in nature.</p>

            An &#x201c;antigen binding protein&#x201d; (&#x201c;ABP&#x201d;) as used herein means any protein that binds a specified target antigen. In the instant application, the specified target antigen is the PCSK9 protein or fragment thereof. &#x201c;Antigen binding protein&#x201d; includes but is not limited to antibodies and binding parts thereof, such as immunologically functional fragments. Peptibodies are another example of antigen binding proteins. The term &#x201c;immunologically functional fragment&#x201d; (or simply &#x201c;fragment&#x201d;) of an antibody or immunoglobulin chain (heavy or light chain) antigen binding protein, as used herein, is a species of antigen binding protein comprising a portion (regardless of how that portion is obtained or synthesized) of an antibody that lacks at least some of the amino acids present in a full-length chain but which is still capable of specifically binding to an antigen. Such fragments are biologically active in that they bind to the target antigen and can compete with other antigen binding proteins, including intact antibodies, for binding to a given epitope. In some embodiments, the fragments are neutralizing fragments. In some embodiments, the fragments can block or reduce the likelihood of the interaction between LDLR and PCSK9. In one aspect, such a fragment will retain at least one CDR present in the full-length light or heavy chain, and in some embodiments will comprise a single heavy chain and/or light chain or portion thereof. These biologically active fragments can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or can be produced by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of antigen binding proteins, including intact antibodies. Immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, a diabody (heavy chain variable domain on the same polypeptide as a light chain variable domain, connected via a short peptide linker that is too short to permit pairing between the two domains on the same chain), Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)
            <sub>2</sub>
            , Fv, domain antibodies and single-chain antibodies, and can be derived from any mammalian source, including but not limited to human, mouse, rat, camelid or rabbit. It is further contemplated that a functional portion of the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein, for example, one or more CDRs, could be covalently bound to a second protein or to a small molecule to create a therapeutic agent directed to a particular target in the body, possessing bifunctional therapeutic properties, or having a prolonged serum half-life. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, an antigen binding protein can include nonprotein components. In some sections of the present disclosure, examples of ABPs are described herein in terms of &#x201c;number/letter/number&#x201d; (e.g., 25A7). In these cases, the exact name denotes a specific antibody. That is, an ABP named 25A7 is not necessarily the same as an antibody named 25A7.1, (unless they are explicitly taught as the same in the specification, e.g., 25A7 and 25A7.3). As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in some embodiments LDLR is not an antigen binding protein. In some embodiments, binding subsections of LDLR are not antigen binding proteins, e.g., EGFa. In some embodiments, other molecules through which PCSK9 signals in vivo are not antigen binding proteins. Such embodiments will be explicitly identified as such.

In this context, a &#x201c;recombinant antigen binding protein&#x201d; is a protein made using recombinant techniques, i.e., through the expression of a recombinant nucleic acid as described herein. Methods and techniques for the production of recombinant proteins are well known in the art.</p>
        <p id="p-0233" num="0232">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; refers to an intact immunoglobulin of any isotype, or a fragment thereof that can compete with the intact antibody for specific binding to the target antigen, and includes, for instance, chimeric, humanized, fully human, and bispecific antibodies. An &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; is a species of an antigen binding protein. An intact antibody will generally comprise at least two full-length heavy chains and two full-length light chains, but in some instances can include fewer chains such as antibodies naturally occurring in camelids which can comprise only heavy chains. Antibodies can be derived solely from a single source, or can be &#x201c;chimeric,&#x201d; that is, different portions of the antibody can be derived from two different antibodies as described further below. The antigen binding proteins, antibodies, or binding fragments can be produced in hybridomas, by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Unless otherwise indicated, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; includes, in addition to antibodies comprising two full-length heavy chains and two full-length light chains, derivatives, variants, fragments, and muteins thereof, examples of which are described below. Furthermore, unless explicitly excluded, antibodies include monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, minibodies, domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred to herein as &#x201c;antibody mimetics&#x201d;), chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, antibody fusions (sometimes referred to herein as &#x201c;antibody conjugates&#x201d;), and fragments thereof, respectively. In some embodiments, the term also encompasses peptibodies.</p>
        <p id="p-0234" num="0233">
            Naturally occurring antibody structural units typically comprise a tetramer. Each such tetramer typically is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one full-length &#x201c;light&#x201d; (in certain embodiments, about 25 kDa) and one full-length &#x201c;heavy&#x201d; chain (in certain embodiments, about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain typically includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids that typically is responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain typically defines a constant region that can be responsible for effector function. Human light chains are typically classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are typically classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. IgG has several subclasses, including, but not limited to, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. IgM has subclasses including, but not limited to, IgM and IgM2. IgA is similarly subdivided into subclasses including, but not limited to, IgA1 and IgA2. Within full-length light and heavy chains, typically, the variable and constant regions are joined by a &#x201c;J&#x201d; region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a &#x201c;D&#x201d; region of about 10 more amino acids.

From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chain variable regions typically comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is typically in accordance with the definitions of Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and 1991)), or Chothia &#x26; Lesk, J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917 (1987); Chothia et al., Nature, 342:878-883 (1989).</p>

In certain embodiments, various methods of analysis can be employed to identify or approximate the CDR regions. Examples of such methods include, but are not limited to, the Kabat definition, the Chothia definition, the AbM definition and the contact definition.</p>
        <p id="p-0238" num="0237">The Kabat definition is a standard for numbering the residues in an antibody and is typically used to identify CDR regions. See, e.g., Johnson &#x26; Wu, Nucleic Acids Res., 28: 214-8 (2000).

            The term &#x201c;neutralizing antigen binding protein&#x201d; or &#x201c;neutralizing antibody&#x201d; refers to an antigen binding protein or antibody, respectively, that binds to a ligand and prevents or reduces the biological effect of that ligand. This can be done, for example, by directly blocking a binding site on the ligand or by binding to the ligand and altering the ligand's ability to bind through indirect means (such as structural or energetic alterations in the ligand). In some embodiments, the term can also denote an antigen binding protein that prevents the protein to which it is bound from performing a biological function. In assessing the binding and/or specificity of an antigen binding protein, e.g., an antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof, an antibody or fragment can substantially inhibit binding of a ligand to its binding partner when an excess of antibody reduces the quantity of binding partner bound to the ligand by at least about 1-20, 20-30%, 30-40%, 40-50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-85%, 85-90%, 90-95%, 95-97%, 97-98%, 98-99% or more (as measured in an in vitro competitive binding assay). In some embodiments, in the case of PCSK9 antigen binding proteins, such a neutralizing molecule can diminish the ability of PCSK9 to bind the LDLR. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ability is characterized and/or described via a competition assay. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ability is described in terms of an IC

In some embodiments, the antibodies or antigen binding proteins neutralize by binding to PCSK9 and preventing PCSK9 from binding to LDLR (or reducing the ability of PCSK9 to bind to LDLR). In some embodiments, the antibodies or ABPs neutralize by binding to PCSK9, and while still allowing PCSK9 to bind to LDLR, preventing or reducing the PCSK9 mediated degradation of LDLR. Thus, in some embodiments, a neutralizing ABP or antibody can still permit PCSK9/LDLR binding, but will prevent (or reduce) subsequent PCSK9 involved degradation of LDLR.

The use of &#x201c;antigen&#x201d; in the phrase &#x201c;antigen binding protein&#x201d; simply denotes that the protein sequence that comprises the antigen can be bound by an antibody. In this context, it does not require that the protein be foreign or that it be capable of inducing an immune response.</p>

            The term &#x201c;compete&#x201d; when used in the context of antigen binding proteins (e.g., neutralizing antigen binding proteins or neutralizing antibodies) that compete for the same epitope means competition between antigen binding proteins as determined by an assay in which the antigen binding protein (e.g., antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof) being tested prevents or inhibits (e.g., reduces) specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein (e.g., a ligand, or a reference antibody) to a common antigen (e.g., PCSK9 or a fragment thereof). Numerous types of competitive binding assays can be used to determine if one antigen binding protein competes with another, for example: solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see, e.g., Stahli et al., 1983,
            <i>Methods in Enzymology </i>
            9:242-253); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Kirkland et al., 1986,
            <i>J. Immunol. </i>
            137:3614-3619) solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, 1988,
            <i>Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual</i>
            , Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid phase direct label RIA using I-125 label (see, e.g., Morel et al., 1988,
            <i>Molec. Immunol. </i>
            25:7-15); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Cheung, et al., 1990,
            <i>Virology </i>
            176:546-552); and direct labeled RIA (Moldenhauer et al., 1990,
            <i>Scand. J. Immunol. </i>
            32:77-82). Typically, such an assay involves the use of purified antigen bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of these, an unlabelled test antigen binding protein and a labeled reference antigen binding protein. Competitive inhibition is measured by determining the amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test antigen binding protein. Usually the test antigen binding protein is present in excess. Antigen binding proteins identified by competition assay (competing antigen binding proteins) include antigen binding proteins binding to the same epitope as the reference antigen binding proteins and antigen binding proteins binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference antigen binding protein for steric hindrance to occur. Additional details regarding methods for determining competitive binding are provided in the examples herein. Usually, when a competing antigen binding protein is present in excess, it will inhibit (e.g., reduce) specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein to a common antigen by at least 40-45%, 45-50%, 50-55%, 55-60%, 60-65%, 65-70%, 70-75% or 75% or more. In some instances, binding is inhibited by at least 80-85%, 85-90%, 90-95%, 95-97%, or 97% or more.

Epitope determinants can include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl or sulfonyl groups, and can have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics.

        <p id="p-0262" num="0261">
            Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease involved in regulating the levels of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein (Horton et al., 2007; Seidah and Prat, 2007). PCSK9 is a prohormone-proprotein convertase in the subtilisin (S8) family of serine proteases (Seidah et al., 2003). An exemplary human PCSK9 amino acid sequence is presented as SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 3. in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>
            (depicting the &#x201c;pro&#x201d; domain of the protein as underlined) and
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>

            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>
            ). As described herein, PCSK9 proteins can also include fragments of the full length PCSK9 protein. The structure of the PCSK9 protein has recently been solved by two groups (Cunningham et al., Nature Structural &#x26; Molecular Biology, 2007, and Piper et al., Structure, 15:1-8, 2007), the entireties of both of which are herein incorporated by reference. PCSK9 includes a signal sequence, a N-terminal prodomain, a subtilisin-like catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain.

        <p id="p-0263" num="0262">Antigen binding proteins (ABPs) that bind PCSK9, including human PCSK9, are provided herein. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins provided are polypeptides which comprise one or more complementary determining regions (CDRs), as described herein. In some antigen binding proteins, the CDRs are embedded into a &#x201c;framework&#x201d; region, which orients the CDR(s) such that the proper antigen binding properties of the CDR(s) is achieved. In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins provided herein can interfere with, block, reduce or modulate the interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR. Such antigen binding proteins are denoted as &#x201c;neutralizing.&#x201d; In some embodiments, binding between PCSK9 and LDLR can still occur, even though the antigen binding protein is neutralizing and bound to PCSK9. For example, in some embodiments, the ABP prevents or reduces the adverse influence of PCSK9 on LDLR without blocking the LDLR binding site on PCSK9. Thus, in some embodiments, the ABP modulates or alters PCSK9's ability to result in the degradation of LDLR, without having to prevent the binding interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR. Such ABPs can be specifically described as &#x201c;non-competitively neutralizing&#x201d; ABPs. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ABP binds to PCSK9 in a location and/or manner that prevents PCSK9 from binding to LDLR. Such ABPs can be specifically described as &#x201c;competitively neutralizing&#x201d; ABPs. Both of the above neutralizers can result in a greater amount of free LDLR being present in a subject, which results in more LDLR binding to LDL (thereby reducing the amount of LDL in the subject). In turn, this results in a reduction in the amount of serum cholesterol present in a subject.</p>
        <p id="p-0264" num="0263">In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins provided herein are capable of inhibiting PCSK9-mediated activity (including binding). In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins binding to these epitopes inhibit, inter alia, interactions between PCSK9 and LDLR and other physiological effects mediated by PCSK9. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins are human, such as fully human antibodies to PCSK9.</p>
        <p id="p-0265" num="0264">In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the mature form of PCSK9. In some embodiments the ABP binds in the prodomain of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP selectively binds to the mature form of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain in a manner such that PCSK9 cannot bind or bind as efficiently to LDLR. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein does not bind to the c-terminus of the catalytic domain. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein does not bind to the n-terminus of the catalytic domain. In some embodiments, the ABP does not bind to the n- or c-terminus of the PCSK9 protein. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to any one of the epitopes bound by the antibodies discussed herein. In some embodiments, this can be determined by competition assays between the antibodies disclosed herein and other antibodies. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to an epitope bound by one of the antibodies described in Table 2. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins bind to a specific conformational state of PCSK9 so as to prevent PCSK9 from interacting with LDLR. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9 and prevents (or reduces) PCSK9 from binding to LDLR. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9, and while it does not prevent (or reduce) the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, the ABP prevents or reduces the adverse activities mediated through PCSK9 on LDLR.</p>
        <p id="p-0266" num="0265">The antigen binding proteins that are disclosed herein have a variety of utilities. Some of the antigen binding proteins, for instance, are useful in specific binding assays, affinity purification of PCSK9, in particular human PCSK9 or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of PCSK9 activity. Some of the antigen binding proteins are useful for inhibiting binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, or inhibiting PCSK9-mediated activities.</p>
        <p id="p-0267" num="0266">The antigen binding proteins can be used in a variety of therapeutic applications, as explained herein. For example, in some embodiments the PCSK9 antigen binding proteins are useful for treating conditions associated with PCSK9, such as cholesterol related disorders (or &#x201c;serum cholesterol related disorders&#x201d;) such as hypercholesterolemia, as further described herein. Other uses for the antigen binding proteins include, for example, diagnosis of PCSK9-associated diseases or conditions and screening assays to determine the presence or absence of PCSK9. Some of the antigen binding proteins described herein are useful in treating consequences, symptoms, and/or the pathology associated with PCSK9 activity.</p>

            Variable regions of immunoglobulin chains generally exhibit the same overall structure, comprising relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions, more often called &#x201c;complementarity determining regions&#x201d; or CDRs. The CDRs from the two chains of each heavy chain/light chain pair mentioned above typically are aligned by the framework regions to form a structure that binds specifically with a specific epitope on the target protein (e.g., PCSK9). From N-terminal to C-terminal, naturally-occurring light and heavy chain variable regions both typically conform with the following order of these elements: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. A numbering system has been devised for assigning numbers to amino acids that occupy positions in each of these domains.

            Again, each of the exemplary variable heavy chains listed in Table 2 can be combined with any of the exemplary variable light chains shown in Table 2 to form an antibody. Table 2 shows exemplary light and heavy chain pairings found in several of the antibodies disclosed herein. In some instances, the antibodies include at least one variable heavy chain and one variable light chain from those listed in Table 2. In other instances, the antibodies contain two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains. As an example, an antibody or antigen binding protein can include a heavy chain and a light chain, two heavy chains, or two light chains. In some embodiments the antigen binding protein comprises (and/or consists) of 1, 2, and/or 3 heavy and/or light CDRs from at least one of the sequences listed in Table 2 (CDRs for the sequences are outlined in

In some embodiments, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more CDRs are included in the ABP.

Optional light chain variable sequences (including CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4) can be selected from the following: 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 46. Optional heavy chain variable sequences (including CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4) can be selected from the following: 74, 85, 71, 72, 67, 87, 58, 52, 51, 53, 48, 54, 55, 56, 49, 57, 50, 91, 64, 62, 89, 65, 79, 80, 76, 77, 78, 83, 69, 81, and 60. In some of the entries in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A-3D</figref>
            , variations of the sequences or alternative boundaries of the CDRs and FRs are identified. These alternatives are identified with a &#x201c;v1&#x201d; following the ABP name. As most of these alternatives are minor in nature, only sections with differences are displayed in the table. It is understood that the remaining section of the light or heavy chain is the same as shown for the base ABP in the other panels. Thus, for example, 19H9v1 in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>
            has the same FR1, CDR1, and FR2 as 19H9 in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>
            as the only difference is noted in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>
            . For three of the nucleic acid sequences (ABPs 26E10, 30B9, and 31B12), additional alternative nucleic acid sequences are provided in the figures. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, no more than one such sequence need actually be used in the creation of an antibody or ABP. Indeed, in some embodiments, only one or neither of the specific heavy or light chain nucleic acids need be present.

        <p id="p-0282" num="0281">In some embodiments, the ABP binds selectively to the form of PCSK9 that binds to LDLR (e.g., the autocatalyzed form of the molecule). In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein does not bind to the c-terminus of the cataylytic domain (e.g., the 5. 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-40 most amino acids in the c-terminus). In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein does not bind to the n-terminus of the catalytic domain (e.g., the 5. 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-40 most amino acids in the n-terminus). In some embodiments, the ABP binds to amino acids within amino acids 1-100 of the mature form of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to amino acids within (and/or amino acid sequences consisting of) amino acids 31-100, 100-200, 31-152, 153-692, 200-300, 300-400, 452-683, 400-500, 500-600, 31-692, 31-449, and/or 600-692. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain. In some embodiments, the neutralizing and/or non-neutralizing ABP binds to the prodomain. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to both the catalytic and pro domains. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain so as to obstruct an area on the catalytic domain that interacts with the pro domain. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain at a location or surface that the pro-domain interacts with as outlined in Piper et al. (Structure 15:1-8 (2007), the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference, including the structural representations therein). In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain and restricts the mobility of the prodomain. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain without binding to the pro-domain. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain, without binding to the pro-domain, while preventing the pro-domain from reorienting to allow PCSK9 to bind to LDLR. In some embodiments, the ABP binds in the same epitope as those surrounding residues 149-152 of the pro-domain in Piper et al. In some embodiments, the ABPs bind to the groove (as outlined in Piper et al.) on the V domain. In some embodiments, the ABPs bind to the histidine-rich patch proximal to the groove on the V domain. In some embodiments, such antibodies (that bind to the V domain) are not neutralizing. In some embodiments, antibodies that bind to the V domain are neutralizing. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ABPs prevent the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR. In some embodiments, the neturalizing ABPs, while preventing the PCSK9 degradation of LDLR, do not prevent the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR (for example ABP 31A4). In some embodiments, the ABP binds to or blocks at least one of the histidines depicted in FIG. 4 of the Piper et al. paper. In some embodiments, the ABP blocks the catalytic triad in PCSK9.</p>

            In some embodiments, the antibody binds selectively to variant PCSK9 proteins, e.g., D374Y over wild type PCSK9. In some embodiments, these antibodies bind to the variant at least twice as strongly as the wild type, and preferably 2-5, 5-10, 10-100, 100-1000, 1000-10,000 fold or more to the mutant than the wild type (as measured via a K
            <sub>d</sub>
            ). In some embodiments, the antibody selectively inhibits variant D374Y PCSK9 from interacting with LDLR over wild type PCSK9's ability to interact with LDLR. In some embodiments, these antibodies block the variant's ability to bind to LDLR more strongly than the wild type's ability, e.g., at least twice as strongly as the wild type, and preferably 2-5, 5-10, 10-100, 100-1000 fold or more to the mutant than the wild type (as measured via an IC
            <sub>50</sub>
            ). In some embodiments, the antibody binds to and neutralizes both wild type PCSK9 and variant forms of PCSK9, such as D374Y at similar levels. In some embodiments, the antibody binds to PCSK9 to prevent variants of LDLR from binding to PCSK9. In some embodiments, the variants of LDLR are at least 50% identical to human LDLR. It is noted that variants of LDLR are known to those of skill in the art (e.g., Brown M S et al, &#x201c;Calcium cages, acid baths and recycling receptors&#x201d; Nature 388: 629-630, 1997). In some embodiments, the ABP can raise the level of effective LDLR in heterozygote familial hypercholesterolemia (where a loss-of function variant of LDLR is present).

        <p id="p-0287" num="0286">In certain embodiments, a humanized antibody is substantially non-immunogenic in humans. In certain embodiments, a humanized antibody has substantially the same affinity for a target as an antibody from another species from which the humanized antibody is derived. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,530,101, U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,761; U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762; U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089.</p>

        <p id="p-0289" num="0288">In certain embodiments, modification of an antibody by methods known in the art is typically designed to achieve increased binding affinity for a target and/or to reduce immunogenicity of the antibody in the recipient. In certain embodiments, humanized antibodies are modified to eliminate glycosylation sites in order to increase affinity of the antibody for its cognate antigen. See, e.g., Co et al., Mol. Immunol., 30:1361-1367 (1993). In certain embodiments, techniques such as &#x201c;reshaping,&#x201d; &#x201c;hyperchimerization,&#x201d; or &#x201c;veneering/resurfacing&#x201d; are used to produce humanized antibodies.

In certain such embodiments, such techniques typically reduce antibody immunogenicity by reducing the number of foreign residues, but do not prevent anti-idiotypic and anti-allotypic responses following repeated administration of the antibodies. Certain other methods for reducing immunogenicity are described, e.g., in Gilliland et al., J. Immunol., 62(6): 3663-71 (1999).</p>

In certain embodiments, the CDRs of the light and heavy chain variable regions of an antibody to PCSK9 can be grafted to consensus human FRs. To create consensus human FRs, in certain embodiments, FRs from several human heavy chain or light chain amino acid sequences are aligned to identify a consensus amino acid sequence. In certain embodiments, the FRs of an antibody to PCSK9 heavy chain or light chain are replaced with the FRs from a different heavy chain or light chain. In certain embodiments, rare amino acids in the FRs of the heavy and light chains of an antibody to PCSK9 are not replaced, while the rest of the FR amino acids are replaced. Rare amino acids are specific amino acids that are in positions in which they are not usually found in FRs. In certain embodiments, the grafted variable regions from an antibody to PCSK9 can be used with a constant region that is different from the constant region of an antibody to PCSK9.

In certain embodiments, nucleotide sequences encoding, and amino acid sequences comprising, heavy and light chain immunoglobulin molecules, particularly sequences corresponding to the variable regions are provided. In certain embodiments, sequences corresponding to complementarity determining regions (CDR's), specifically from CDR1 through CDR3, are provided. According to certain embodiments, a hybridoma cell line expressing such an immunoglobulin molecule is provided. According to certain embodiments, a hybridoma cell line expressing such a monoclonal antibody is provided. In certain embodiments a hybridoma cell line is selected from at least one of the cell lines described in Table 2, e.g., 21B12, 16F12 and 31H4.

        <p id="p-0293" num="0292">One can engineer mouse strains deficient in mouse antibody production with large fragments of the human Ig loci in anticipation that such mice would produce human antibodies in the absence of mouse antibodies. Large human Ig fragments can preserve the large variable gene diversity as well as the proper regulation of antibody production and expression. By exploiting the mouse machinery for antibody diversification and selection and the lack of immunological tolerance to human proteins, the reproduced human antibody repertoire in these mouse strains can yield high affinity fully human antibodies against any antigen of interest, including human antigens. Using the hybridoma technology, antigen-specific human MAbs with the desired specificity can be produced and selected. Certain exemplary methods are described in WO 98/24893, U.S. Pat.

Furthermore, the utilization of such technology for substitution of mouse loci with their human equivalents could provide insights into the expression and regulation of human gene products during development, their communication with other systems, and their involvement in disease induction and progression.</p>
        <p id="p-0296" num="0295">Human antibodies avoid some of the problems associated with antibodies that possess murine or rat variable and/or constant regions. The presence of such murine or rat derived proteins can lead to the rapid clearance of the antibodies or can lead to the generation of an immune response against the antibody by a patient. In order to avoid the utilization of murine or rat derived antibodies, fully human antibodies can be generated through the introduction of functional human antibody loci into a rodent, other mammal or animal so that the rodent, other mammal or animal produces fully human antibodies.</p>

One skilled in the art can opt for chemically similar amino acid substitutions for such predicted important amino acid residues.</p>
        <p id="p-0307" num="0306">One skilled in the art can also analyze the three-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence in relation to that structure in similar ABPs. In view of such information, one skilled in the art can predict the alignment of amino acid residues of an antibody with respect to its three dimensional structure. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art can choose not to make radical changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the protein, since such residues can be involved in important interactions with other molecules. Moreover, one skilled in the art can generate test variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each desired amino acid residue. The variants can then be screened using activity assays known to those skilled in the art. Such variants can be used to gather information about suitable variants. For example, if one discovered that a change to a particular amino acid residue resulted in destroyed, undesirably reduced, or unsuitable activity, variants with such a change can be avoided. In other words, based on information gathered from such routine experiments, one skilled in the art can readily determine the amino acids where further substitutions should be avoided either alone or in combination with other mutations.</p>
        <p id="p-0308" num="0307">A number of scientific publications have been devoted to the prediction of secondary structure. See Moult J., Curr. Op. in Biotech., 7(4):422-427 (1996), Chou et al., Biochemistry, 13(2):222-245 (1974); Chou et al., Biochemistry, 113(2):211-222 (1974); Chou et al., Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol., 47:45-148 (1978); Chou et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem., 47:251-276 and Chou et al., Biophys. J., 26:367-384 (1979). Moreover, computer programs are currently available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting secondary structure is based upon homology modeling. For example, two polypeptides or proteins which have a sequence identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater than 40% often have similar structural topologies. The recent growth of the protein structural database (PDB) has provided enhanced predictability of secondary structure, including the potential number of folds within a polypeptide's or protein's structure. See Holm et al., Nucl. Acid. Res., 27(1):244-247 (1999). It has been suggested (Brenner et al., Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 7(3):369-376 (1997)) that there are a limited number of folds in a given polypeptide or protein and that once a critical number of structures have been resolved, structural prediction will become dramatically more accurate.</p>

        <p id="p-0310" num="0309">In certain embodiments, antigen binding protein variants include glycosylation variants wherein the number and/or type of glycosylation site has been altered compared to the amino acid sequences of a parent polypeptide. In certain embodiments, protein variants comprise a greater or a lesser number of N-linked glycosylation sites than the native protein. An N-linked glycosylation site is characterized by the sequence: Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr, wherein the amino acid residue designated as X can be any amino acid residue except proline. The substitution of amino acid residues to create this sequence provides a potential new site for the addition of an N-linked carbohydrate chain. Alternatively, substitutions which eliminate this sequence will remove an existing N-linked carbohydrate chain. Also provided is a rearrangement of N-linked carbohydrate chains wherein one or more N-linked glycosylation sites (typically those that are naturally occurring) are eliminated and one or more new N-linked sites are created. Additional preferred antibody variants include cysteine variants wherein one or more cysteine residues are deleted from or substituted for another amino acid (e.g., serine) as compared to the parent amino acid sequence. Cysteine variants can be useful when antibodies must be refolded into a biologically active conformation such as after the isolation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Cysteine variants generally have fewer cysteine residues than the native protein, and typically have an even number to minimize interactions resulting from unpaired cysteines.</p>

            According to certain embodiments, amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and/or (4) confer or modify other physiocochemical or functional properties on such polypeptides. According to certain embodiments, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (in certain embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions) can be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (in certain embodiments, in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts). In certain embodiments, a conservative amino acid substitution typically may not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence).

One of skill in the art will appreciate that the above discussion can be used for identifying, evaluating, and/creating ABP protein variants and also for nucleic acid sequences that can encode for those protein variants. Thus, nucleic acid sequences encoding for those protein variants (as well as nucleic acid sequences that encode for the ABPs in Table 2, but are different from those explicitly disclosed herein) are contemplated.

In one embodiment, suitable moderately stringent conditions include prewashing in a solution of 5&#xd7;SSC; 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8:0); hybridizing at 50&#xb0; C., &#x2212;65&#xb0; C., 5&#xd7;SSC, overnight or, in the event of cross-species homology, at 45&#xb0; C. with 0.5&#xd7;SSC; followed by washing twice at 65&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes with each of 2&#xd7;, 0.5&#xd7; and 0.2&#xd7;SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Such hybridizing DNA sequences are also within the scope of this invention, as are nucleotide sequences that, due to code degeneracy, encode an antibody polypeptide that is encoded by a hybridizing DNA sequence and the amino acid sequences that are encoded by these nucleic acid sequences.

            D). The phrase &#x201c;selectively hybridize&#x201d; referred to in this context means to detectably and selectively bind. Polynucleotides, oligonucleotides and fragments thereof in accordance with the invention selectively hybridize to nucleic acid strands under hybridization and wash conditions that minimize appreciable amounts of detectable binding to nonspecific nucleic acids. High stringency conditions can be used to achieve selective hybridization conditions as known in the art and discussed herein. Generally, the nucleic acid sequence homology between the polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, and fragments of the invention and a nucleic acid sequence of interest will be at least 80%, and more typically with preferably increasing homologies of at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, and 100%. Two amino acid sequences are homologous if there is a partial or complete identity between their sequences. For example, 85% homology means that 85% of the amino acids are identical when the two sequences are aligned for maximum matching. Gaps (in either of the two sequences being matched) are allowed in maximizing matching; gap lengths of 5 or less are preferred with 2 or less being more preferred. Alternatively and preferably, two protein sequences (or polypeptide sequences derived from them of at least 30 amino acids in length) are homologous, as this term is used herein, if they have an alignment score of at more than 5 (in standard deviation units) using the program ALIGN with the mutation data matrix and a gap penalty of 6 or greater. See Dayhoff, M. O., in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, pp. 101-110 (Volume 5, National Biomedical Research Foundation (1972)) and Supplement 2 to this volume, pp. 1-10. The two sequences or parts thereof are more preferably homologous if their amino acids are greater than or equal to 50% identical when optimally aligned using the ALIGN program. The term &#x201c;corresponds to&#x201d; is used herein to mean that a polynucleotide sequence is homologous (i.e., is identical, not strictly evolutionarily related) to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence, or that a polypeptide sequence is identical to a reference polypeptide sequence. In contradistinction, the term &#x201c;complementary to&#x201d; is used herein to mean that the complementary sequence is homologous to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence. For illustration, the nucleotide sequence &#x201c;TATAC&#x201d; corresponds to a reference sequence &#x201c;TATAC&#x201d; and is complementary to a reference sequence &#x201c;GTATA&#x201d;.

        <p id="p-0314" num="0313">
            In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins (such as antibodies) are produced by immunization with an antigen (e.g., PCSK9). In certain embodiments, antibodies can be produced by immunization with full-length PCSK9, a soluble form of PCSK9, the catalytic domain alone, the mature form of PCSK9 shown in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>
            , a splice variant form of PCSK9, or a fragment thereof. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention can be polyclonal or monoclonal, and/or can be recombinant antibodies. In certain embodiments, antibodies of the invention are human antibodies prepared, for example, by immunization of transgenic animals capable of producing human antibodies (see, for example, PCT Published Application No. WO 93/12227).

        <p id="p-0315" num="0314">In certain embodiments, certain strategies can be employed to manipulate inherent properties of an antibody, such as the affinity of an antibody for its target. Such strategies include, but are not limited to, the use of site-specific or random mutagenesis of the polynucleotide molecule encoding an antibody to generate an antibody variant. In certain embodiments, such generation is followed by screening for antibody variants that exhibit the desired change, e.g. increased or decreased affinity.</p>
        <p id="p-0316" num="0315">In certain embodiments, the amino acid residues targeted in mutagenic strategies are those in the CDRs. In certain embodiments, amino acids in the framework regions of the variable domains are targeted. In certain embodiments, such framework regions have been shown to contribute to the target binding properties of certain antibodies. See, e.g., Hudson, Curr. Opin. Biotech., 9:395-402 (1999) and references therein.</p>
        <p id="p-0317" num="0316">In certain embodiments, smaller and more effectively screened libraries of antibody variants are produced by restricting random or site-directed mutagenesis to hyper-mutation sites in the CDRs, which are sites that correspond to areas prone to mutation during the somatic affinity maturation process. See, e.g., Chowdhury &#x26; Pastan, Nature Biotech., 17: 568-572 (1999) and references therein. In certain embodiments, certain types of DNA elements can be used to identify hyper-mutation sites including, but not limited to, certain direct and inverted repeats, certain consensus sequences, certain secondary structures, and certain palindromes. For example, such DNA elements that can be used to identify hyper-mutation sites include, but are not limited to, a tetrabase sequence comprising a purine (A or G), followed by guainine (G), followed by a pyrimidine (C or T), followed by either adenosine or thymidine (A or T) (i.e., A/G-G-C/T-A/T). Another example of a DNA element that can be used to identify hyper-mutation sites is the serine codon, A-G-C/T.</p>

        <p id="p-0318" num="0317">
            In certain embodiments, a phage display technique is used to generate monoclonal antibodies. In certain embodiments, such techniques produce fully human monoclonal antibodies. In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide encoding a single Fab or Fv antibody fragment is expressed on the surface of a phage particle. See, e.g., Hoogenboom et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381 (1991); Marks et al.,

Thus, certain such processes mimic immune selection through the display of antibody fragment repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, and subsequent selection of phage by their binding to target. In certain such procedures, high affinity functional neutralizing antibody fragments are isolated. In certain such embodiments (discussed in more detail below), a complete repertoire of human antibody genes is created by cloning naturally rearranged human V genes from peripheral blood lymphocytes. See, e.g., Mullinax et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA), 87: 8095-8099 (1990).

Technologies utilized for achieving this result are disclosed in the patents, applications and references disclosed in the specification, herein. In certain embodiments, one can employ methods such as those disclosed in PCT Published Application No. WO 98/24893 or in Mendez et al., Nature Genetics, 15:146-156 (1997), which are hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.</p>
        <p id="p-0320" num="0319">Generally, fully human monoclonal ABPs (e.g., antibodies) specific for PCSK9 can be produced as follows. Transgenic mice containing human immunoglobulin genes are immunized with the antigen of interest, e.g. PCSK9, lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) from the mice that express antibodies are obtained. Such recovered cells are fused with a myeloid-type cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines, and such hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. In certain embodiments, the production of a hybridoma cell line that produces antibodies specific to PCSK9 is provided.</p>
        <p id="p-0321" num="0320">In certain embodiments, fully human antibodies are produced by exposing human splenocytes (B or T cells) to an antigen in vitro, and then reconstituting the exposed cells in an immunocompromised mouse, e.g. SCID or nod/SCID. See, e.g., Brams et al., J. Immunol. 160: 2051-2058 (1998); Carballido et al., Nat. Med., 6: 103-106 (2000). In certain such approaches, engraftment of human fetal tissue into SCID mice (SCID-hu) results in long-term hematopoiesis and human T-cell development. See, e.g., McCune et al., Science, 241:1532-1639 (1988); Ifversen et al., Sem. Immunol., 8:243-248 (1996). In certain instances, humoral immune response in such chimeric mice is dependent on co-development of human T-cells in the animals. See, e.g., Martens son et al., Immunol., 83:1271-179 (1994). In certain approaches, human peripheral blood lymphocytes are transplanted into SCID mice. See, e.g., Mosier et al., Nature, 335:256-259 (1988). In certain such embodiments, when such transplanted cells are treated either with a priming agent, such as Staphylococcal Enterotoxin A (SEA), or with anti-human CD40 monoclonal antibodies, higher levels of B cell production is detected. See, e.g., Martensson et al., Immunol., 84: 224-230 (1995); Murphy et al., Blood, 86:1946-1953 (1995).</p>
        <p id="p-0322" num="0321">Thus, in certain embodiments, fully human antibodies can be produced by the expression of recombinant DNA in host cells or by expression in hybridoma cells. In other embodiments, antibodies can be produced using the phage display techniques described herein.</p>

Certain methods for quantifying the degree of purification are known to those of skill in the art. Certain exemplary methods include, but are not limited to, determining the specific binding activity of the preparation and assessing the amount of a polypeptide within a preparation by SDS/PAGE analysis. Certain exemplary methods for assessing the amount of purification of a polypeptide preparation comprise calculating the binding activity of a preparation and comparing it to the binding activity of an initial extract.

In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope or a sequence comprising a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized as an immunogen to generate antibodies or antigen binding proteins that bind to PCSK9. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be administered to an animal, and antibodies that bind to PCSK9 can subsequently be obtained from the animal.

        <p id="p-0356" num="0355">
            In some embodiments, the domain(s)/region(s) containing residues that are in contact with or are buried by an antibody can be identified by mutating specific residues in PCSK9 (e.g., a wild-type antigen) and determining whether the antigen binding protein can bind the mutated or variant PCSK9 protein. By making a number of individual mutations, residues that play a direct role in binding or that are in sufficiently close proximity to the antibody such that a mutation can affect binding between the antigen binding protein and antigen can be identified. From a knowledge of these amino acids, the domain(s) or region(s) of the antigen that contain residues in contact with the antigen binding protein or covered by the antibody can be elucidated. Such a domain can include the binding epitope of an antigen binding protein. One specific example of this general approach utilizes an arginine/glutamic acid scanning protocol (see, e.g., Nanevicz, T., et al., 1995,
            <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>
            270:37, 21619-21625 and Zupnick, A., et al., 2006,
            <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>
            281:29, 20464-20473). In general, arginine and glutamic acids are substituted (typically individually) for an amino acid in the wild-type polypeptide because these amino acids are charged and bulky and thus have the potential to disrupt binding between an antigen binding protein and an antigen in the region of the antigen where the mutation is introduced. Arginines that exist in the wild-type antigen are replaced with glutamic acid. A variety of such individual mutants are obtained and the collected binding results analyzed to determine what residues affect binding.
        </p>
        <p id="p-0357" num="0356">Example 39 describes one such arginine/glutamic acid scanning of PCSK9 for PCSK9 antigen binding proteins provided herein. A series of mutant PCSK9 antigens were created, with each mutant antigen having a single mutation. Binding of each mutant PCSK9 antigen with various PCSK9 ABPs was measured and compared to the ability of the selected ABPs to bind wild-type PCSK9 (SEQ ID NO: 303).</p>
        <p id="p-0358" num="0357">
            An alteration (for example a reduction or increase) in binding between an antigen binding protein and a variant PCSK9 as used herein means that there is a change in binding affinity (e.g., as measured by known methods such as Biacore testing or the bead based assay described below in the examples), EC
            <sub>50</sub>
            , and/or a change (for example a reduction) in the total binding capacity of the antigen binding protein (for example, as evidenced by a decrease in Bmax in a plot of antigen binding protein concentration versus antigen concentration). A significant alteration in binding indicates that the mutated residue is directly involved in binding to the antigen binding protein or is in close proximity to the binding protein when the binding protein is bound to antigen.
        </p>
        <p id="p-0359" num="0358">In some embodiments, a significant reduction in binding means that the binding affinity, EC50, and/or capacity between an antigen binding protein and a mutant PCSK9 antigen is reduced by greater than 10%, greater than 20%, greater than 40%, greater than 50%, greater than 55%, greater than 60%, greater than 65%, greater than 70%, greater than 75%, greater than 80%, greater than 85%, greater than 90% or greater than 95% relative to binding between the antigen binding protein and a wild type PCSK9 (e.g., shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or SEQ ID NO: (303). In certain embodiments, binding is reduced below detectable limits. In some embodiments, a significant reduction in binding is evidenced when binding of an antigen binding protein to a variant PCSK9 protein is less than 50% (for example, less than 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15% or 10%) of the binding observed between the antigen binding protein and a wild-type PCSK9 protein (for example, the protein of SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or SEQ ID NO: (303). Such binding measurements can be made using a variety of binding assays known in the art. A specific example of one such assay is described in Example 39.</p>

        <p id="p-0380" num="0379">In certain instances, PCSK9 activity correlates with a number of human disease states. For example, in certain instances, too much or too little PCSK9 activity correlates with certain conditions, such as hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, in certain instances, modulating PCSK9 activity can be therapeutically useful. In certain embodiments, a neutralizing antigen binding protein to PCSK9 is used to modulate at least one PCSK9 activity (e.g., binding to LDLR). Such methods can treat and/or prevent and/or reduce the risk of disorders that relate to elevated serum cholesterol levels or in which elevated cholesterol levels are relevant.</p>
        <p id="p-0381" num="0380">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in light of the present disclosure, disorders that relate to, involve, or can be influenced by varied cholesterol, LDL, or LDLR levels can be addressed by various embodiments of the antigen binding proteins. In some embodiments, a &#x201c;cholesterol related disorder&#x201d; (which includes &#x201c;serum cholesterol related disorders&#x201d;) includes any one or more of the following: hypercholesterolemia, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimers disease and generally dyslipidemias, which can be manifested, for example, by an elevated total serum cholesterol, elevated LDL, elevated triglycerides, elevated VLDL, and/or low HDL. Some non-limiting examples of primary and secondary dyslipidemias that can be treated using an ABP, either alone, or in combination with one or more other agents include the metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, familial combined hyperlipidemia, familial hypertriglyceridemia, familial hypercholesterolemias, including heterozygous hypercholesterolemia, homozygous hypercholesterolemia, familial defective apoplipoprotein B-100; polygenic hypercholesterolemia; remnant removal disease, hepatic lipase deficiency; dyslipidemia secondary to any of the following: dietary indiscretion, hypothyroidism, drugs including estrogen and progestin therapy, beta-blockers, and thiazide diuretics; nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal failure, Cushing's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, glycogen storage diseases, hepatoma, cholestasis, acromegaly, insulinoma, isolated growth hormone deficiency, and alcohol-induced hypertriglyceridemia. ABP can also be useful in preventing or treating atherosclerotic diseases, such as, for example, coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, stroke (ischaemic and hemorrhagic), angina pectoris, or cerebrovascular disease and acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction. In some embodiments, the ABP is useful in reducing the risk of: nonfatal heart attacks, fatal and non-fatal strokes, certain types of heart surgery, hospitalization for heart failure, chest pain in patients with heart disease, and/or cardiovascular events because of established heart disease such as prior heart attack, prior heart surgery, and/or chest pain with evidence of clogged arteries. In some embodiments, the ABP and methods can be used to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.</p>

In addition, in some embodiments, disorders or disease that can benefit from the prevention of cholesterol synthesis or increased LDLR expression can also be treated by various embodiments of the antigen binding proteins. In addition, as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the use of the anti-PCSK9 antibodies can be especially useful in the treatment of Diabetes. Not only is Diabetes a risk factor for coronary heart disease, but insulin increases the expression of PCSK9. That is, people with Diabetes have elevated plasma lipid levels (which can be related to high PCSK9 levels) and can benefit from lowering those levels. This is generally discussed in more detail in Costet et al.

        <p id="p-0408" num="0407">The pharmaceutical composition to be used for in vivo administration typically is sterile. In certain embodiments, this can be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. In certain embodiments, where the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using this method can be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. In certain embodiments, the composition for parenteral administration can be stored in lyophilized form or in a solution. In certain embodiments, parenteral compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.</p>
        <p id="p-0409" num="0408">In certain embodiments, once the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it can be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or as a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. In certain embodiments, such formulations can be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in a form (e.g., lyophilized) that is reconstituted prior to administration.</p>
        <p id="p-0410" num="0409">In certain embodiments, kits are provided for producing a single-dose administration unit. In certain embodiments, the kit can contain both a first container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous formulation. In certain embodiments, kits containing single and multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes) are included.</p>
        <p id="p-0411" num="0410">In certain embodiments, the effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for treatment, according to certain embodiments, will thus vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication for which an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, is being used, the route of administration, and the size (body weight, body surface or organ size) and/or condition (the age and general health) of the patient. In certain embodiments, the clinician can titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. In certain embodiments, a typical dosage can range from about 0.1 &#x3bc;g/kg to up to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In certain embodiments, the dosage can range from 0.1 &#x3bc;g/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 1 &#x3bc;g/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 &#x3bc;g/kg up to about 100 mg/kg.</p>
        <p id="p-0412" num="0411">In certain embodiments, the frequency of dosing will take into account the pharmacokinetic parameters of an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 and/or any additional therapeutic agents in the formulation used. In certain embodiments, a clinician will administer the composition until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. In certain embodiments, the composition can therefore be administered as a single dose, or as two or more doses (which may or may not contain the same amount of the desired molecule) over time, or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or catheter. Further refinement of the appropriate dosage is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art and is within the ambit of tasks routinely performed by them. In certain embodiments, appropriate dosages can be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data. In some embodiments, the amount and frequency of administration can take into account the desired cholesterol level (serum and/or total) to be obtained and the subject's present cholesterol level, LDL level, and/or LDLR levels, all of which can be obtained by methods that are well known to those of skill in the art.</p>
        <p id="p-0413" num="0412">In certain embodiments, the route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is in accord with known methods, e.g. orally, through injection by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intra-parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, subcutaneously, intra-ocular, intraarterial, intraportal, or intralesional routes; by sustained release systems or by implantation devices. In certain embodiments, the compositions can be administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation device.</p>
        <p id="p-0414" num="0413">In certain embodiments, the composition can be administered locally via implantation of a membrane, sponge or another appropriate material onto which the desired molecule has been absorbed or encapsulated. In certain embodiments, where an implantation device is used, the device can be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of the desired molecule can be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous administration.</p>
        <p id="p-0415" num="0414">In certain embodiments, it can be desirable to use a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, in an ex vivo manner. In such instances, cells, tissues and/or organs that have been removed from the patient are exposed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, after which the cells, tissues and/or organs are subsequently implanted back into the patient.</p>
        <p id="p-0416" num="0415">In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 and/or any additional therapeutic agents can be delivered by implanting certain cells that have been genetically engineered, using methods such as those described herein, to express and secrete the polypeptides. In certain embodiments, such cells can be animal or human cells, and can be autologous, heterologous, or xenogeneic. In certain embodiments, the cells can be immortalized. In certain embodiments, in order to decrease the chance of an immunological response, the cells can be encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. In certain embodiments, the encapsulation materials are typically biocompatible, semi-permeable polymeric enclosures or membranes that allow the release of the protein product(s) but prevent the destruction of the cells by the patient's immune system or by other detrimental factors from the surrounding tissues.</p>
        <p id="p-0417" num="0416">Based on the ability of ABPs to significantly neutralize PCSK9 activity (as demonstrated in the Examples below), these ABPs will have therapeutic effects in treating and preventing symptoms and conditions resulting from PCSK9-mediated activity, such as hypercholesterolemia.</p>
        <p id="h-0017" num="0000">Diagnostic Applications</p>
        <p id="p-0418" num="0417">In some embodiments, the ABP is used as a diagnostic tool. The ABP can be used to assay the amount of PCSK9 present in a sample and/or subject. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, such ABPs need not be neutralizing ABPs. In some embodiments, the diagnostic ABP is not a neutralizing ABP. In some embodiments, the diagnostic ABP binds to a different epitope than the neutralizing ABP binds to. In some embodiments, the two ABPs do not compete with one another.</p>
        <p id="p-0419" num="0418">In some embodiments, the ABPs disclosed herein are used or provided in an assay kit and/or method for the detection of PCSK9 in mammalian tissues or cells in order to screen/diagnose for a disease or disorder associated with changes in levels of PCSK9. The kit comprises an ABP that binds PCSK9 and means for indicating the binding of the ABP with PCSK9, if present, and optionally PCSK9 protein levels. Various means for indicating the presence of an ABP can be used. For example, fluorophores, other molecular probes, or enzymes can be linked to the ABP and the presence of the ABP can be observed in a variety of ways. The method for screening for such disorders can involve the use of the kit, or simply the use of one of the disclosed ABPs and the determination of whether the ABP binds to PCSK9 in a sample. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, high or elevated levels of PCSK9 will result in larger amounts of the ABP binding to PCSK9 in the sample. Thus, degree of ABP binding can be used to determine how much PCSK9 is in a sample. Subjects or samples with an amount of PCSK9 that is greater than a predetermined amount (e.g., an amount or range that a person without a PCSK9 related disorder would have) can be characterized as having a PCSK9 mediated disorder. In some embodiments, the ABP is administered to a subject taking a statin, in order to determine if the statin has increased the amount of PCSK9 in the subject.</p>
        <p id="p-0420" num="0419">In some embodiments, the ABP is a non-neutralizing ABP and is used to determine the amount of PCSK9 in a subject receiving an ABP and/or statin treatment.</p>

        <p id="p-0425" num="0424">The protocol used to titer the XenoMouse animals was as follows: Costar 3368 medium binding plates were coated with neutravadin @ 8 ug/ml (50 ul/well) and incubated at 4&#xb0; C. in 1&#xd7;PBS/0.05% azide overnight. They were washed using TiterTek 3-cycle wash with RO water. Plates were blocked using 250 ul of 1&#xd7;PBS/1% milk and incubated for at least 30 minutes at RT. Block was washed off using TiterTek 3-cycle wash with RO water. One then captured b-human PCSK9 @ 2 ug/ml in 1&#xd7;PBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca2+ (assay diluent) 50 ul/well and incubated for 1 hr at RT. One then washed using TiterTek 3-cycle wash with RO water. For the primary antibody, sera was titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 1:100. This was done in assay diluent 50 ul/well and incubated for 1 hr at RT. One then washed using TiterTek 3-cycle wash with RO water. The secondary antibody was goat anti Human IgG Fc HRP @ 400 ng/ml in assay diluent at 50 ul/well. This was incubated for 1 hr at RT. This was then washed using TiterTek 3-cycle wash with RO water and patted dry on paper towels. For the substrate, one-step TMB solution (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was used (50 ul/well) and it was allowed to develop for 30 min at RT.</p>

            The protocols followed in the ELISA assays was as follows: For samples comprising b-PCSK9 with no V5H is tag the following protocol was employed: Costar 3368 medium binding plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed. The plates were coated with neutravadin at 8 &#x3bc;g/ml in 1&#xd7;PBS/0.05% Azide, (50 &#x3bc;l/well). The plates were incubated at 4&#xb0; C. overnight. The plates were then washed using a Titertek M384 plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala.). A 3-cycle wash was performed. The plates were blocked with 250 &#x3bc;l of 1&#xd7;PBS/1% milk and incubated approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then washed using the M384 plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was performed. The capture was b-hu PCSK9, without a V5 tag, and was added at 2 &#x3bc;g/ml in 1&#xd7;PBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca
            <sup>2+</sup>
            (40 &#x3bc;l/well). The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. A 3-cycle wash was performed. Sera were titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 1:100, and row H was blank for sera. The titration was done in assay diluent, at a volume of 50 &#x3bc;l/well. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, a 3-cycle wash was performed. Goat anti Human IgG Fc HRP at 100 ng/ml (1:4000) in 1&#xd7;PBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca
            <sup>2+</sup>
            (50 &#x3bc;l/well) was added to the plate and was incubated 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed once again, using a 3-cycle wash. The plates were then patted dry with paper towel. Finally, 1 step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) (50 &#x3bc;l/well) was added to the plate and was quenched with 1N hydrochloric acid (50 &#x3bc;l/well) after 30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader.

        <p id="p-0427" num="0426">Positive controls to detect plate bound PCSK9 were soluble LDL receptor (R&#x26;D Systems, Cat #2148LD/CF) and a polyclonal rabbit anti-PCSK9 antibody (Caymen Chemical #10007185) titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 3 &#x3bc;g/ml in assay diluent. LDLR was detected with goat anti LDLR (R&#x26;D Systems, Cat #AF2148) and rabbit anti goat IgGFc HRP at a concentration of 400 ng/ml; the rabbit polyclonal was detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG Fc at a concentration of 400 ng/ml in assay diluent.

A 3-cycle wash was performed. The capture was b-hu PCSK9, with a V5 tag, and was added at 2 &#x3bc;g/ml in 1&#xd7;PBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca
            <sup>2+</sup>
            (40 &#x3bc;l/well). The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. A 3-cycle wash was performed. Sera were titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 1:100, and row H was blank for sera. The titration was done in assay diluent, at a volume of 50 &#x3bc;l/well. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed using the M384 plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. Goat anti Human IgG Fc HRP at 400 ng/ml in 1&#xd7;PBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca
            <sup>2+</sup>
            was added at 50 &#x3bc;l/well to the plate and the plate was incubated 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed once again, using a 3-cycle wash. The plates were then patted dry with paper towel. Finally, 1 step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) (50 &#x3bc;l/well) was added to the plate and the plate was quenched with 1N hydrochloric acid (50 &#x3bc;l/well) after 30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader.

        <p id="p-0429" num="0428">Positive control was LDLR, rabbit anti-PCSK9 titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 3 &#x3bc;g/ml in assay diluent. LDLR detect with goat anti-LDLR (R&#x26;D Systems, Cat #AF2148) and rabbit anti-goat IgG Fc HRP at a concentration of 400 ng/ml; rabbit poly detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG Fc at a concentration of 400 ng/ml in assay diluent. Human anti-His 1.2,3 and anti-V5 1.7.1 titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 1 &#x3bc;g/ml in assay diluent; both detected with goat anti-human IgG Fc HRP at a concentration of 400 ng/ml in assay diluent. Negative control was naive XMG2-KL and XMG4-KL sera titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 1:100 in assay diluent.</p>
        <p id="p-0430" num="0429">Titers of the antibody against human PCSK9 were tested by ELISA assay for mice immunized with soluble antigen as described. Table 4 summarizes the ELISA data and indicates that there were some mice which appeared to be specific for PCSK9. See, e.g., Table 4. Therefore, at the end of the immunization program, 10 mice (in bold in Table 4) were selected for harvest, and splenocytes and lymphocytes were isolated from the spleens and lymph nodes respectively, as described herein.</p>

            To screen for the antibodies that block PCSK9 binding to LDLR an assay was developed using the D374Y PCSK9 mutant. The mutant was used for this assay because it has a higher binding affinity to LDLR allowing a more sensitive receptor ligand blocking assay to be developed. The following protocol was employed in the receptor ligand blocking screen: Costar 3702 medium binding 384 well plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed in the screen. The plates were coated with goat anti-LDLR (R&#x26;D Cat #AF2148) at 2 &#x3bc;g/ml in 1&#xd7;PBS/0.05% Azide at a volume of 40 &#x3bc;l/well. The plates were incubated at 4&#xb0; C. overnight.

Contemporaneously, 20 ng/ml of biotinylated human D374Y PCSK9 was incubated with 15 microliters of hybridoma exhaust supernatant in Nunc polypropylene plates and the exhaust supernatant concentration was diluted 1:5. The plates were then pre-incubated for about 1 hour and 30 minutes at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed using the Titertek plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. 50 &#x3bc;l/well of the pre-incubated mixture was transferred onto the LDLR coated ELISA plates and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. To detect LDLR-bound b-PCSK9, 40 &#x3bc;l/well streptavidin HRP at 500 ng/ml in assay diluent was added to the plates. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were again washed using a Titertek plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was performed. Finally, 40 &#x3bc;l/well of One-step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was added to the plate and was quenched with 40 &#x3bc;l/well of 1N hydrochloric acid after 30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader. The screen identified 384 antibodies that blocked the interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR well, 100 antibodies blocked the interaction strongly (OD&#x3c;0.3). These antibodies inhibited the binding interaction of PCSK9 and LDLR greater than 90% (greater than 90% inhibition).

Limiting dilution was used to isolate a manageable number of clones from each line. The clones were designated by hybridoma line number (e.g. 21B12) and clone number (e.g. 21B12.1). In general, no difference among the different clones of a particular line were detected by the functional assays described herein. In a few cases, clones were identified from a particular line that behaved differently in the functional assays, for example, 25A7.1 was found not to block PCSK9/LDLR but 25A7.3 (referred to herein as 25A7) was neutralizing. The isolated clones were each expanded in 50-100 ml of hybridoma media and allowed to grow to exhaustion, (i.e., less than about 10% cell viability). The concentration and potency of the antibodies to PCSK9 in the supernatants of those cultures were determined by ELISA and by in vitro functional testing, as described herein. As a result of the screening described herein, the hybridomas with the highest titer of antibodies to PCSK9 were identified. The selected hybridomas are shown in

        <p id="p-0447" num="0446">This example generally describes how one of the antigen binding proteins was produced from a hybridoma line. The production work used 50 ml exhaust supernatant generation followed by protein A purification. Integra production was for scale up and was performed later. Hybridoma line 31H4 was grown in T75 flasks in 20 ml of media (Integra Media, Table 5). When the hybridoma was nearly confluent in the T75 flasks, it was transferred to an Integra flask (Integra Biosciences, Integra CL1000, cat#90 005).</p>

            The Integra flask is a cell culture flask that is divided by a membrane into two chambers, a small chamber and a large chamber. A volume of 20-30 ml hybridoma cells at a minimum cell density of 1&#xd7;10
            <sup>6 </sup>
            cells per ml from the 31H4 hybridoma line was placed into the small chamber of an Integra flask in Integra media (see Table 5 for components of Integra media). Integra media alone (1 L) was placed in the large chambers of the Integra flasks. The membrane separating the two chambers is permeable to small molecular weight nutrients but is impermeable to hybridoma cells and to antibodies produced by those cells. Thus, the hybridoma cells and the antibodies produced by those hybridoma cells were retained in the small chamber.
        </p>
        <p id="p-0449" num="0448">After one week, media was removed from both chambers of the Integra flask and was replaced with fresh Integra media. The collected media from the small chambers was separately retained. After a second week of growth, the media from the small chamber was again collected. The collected media from week 1 from the hybridoma line was combined with the collected media from week 2 from the hybridoma line. The resulting collected media sample from the hybridoma line was spun to remove cells and debris (15 minutes at 3000 rpm) and the resulting supernatant was filtered (0.22 um). Clarified conditioned media was loaded onto a Protein A-Sepharose column. Optionally, the media can be first concentrated and then loaded onto a Protein A Sepharose column. Non-specific bindings were removed by an extensive PBS wash. Bound antibody proteins on the Protein A column were recovered by standard acidic antibody elution from Protein A columns (such as 50 mM Citrate, pH 3.0). Aggregated antibody proteins in the Protein A Sepharose pool were removed by size exclusion chromatography or binding ion exchange chromatography on anion exchanger resin such as Q Sepharose resin. The specific IEX conditions for the 31H4 proteins are Q-Sepharose HP at pH 7.8-8.0. Antibody was eluted with a NaCl gradient of 10 mM-500 mM in 25 column volumes.</p>

        <p id="p-0469" num="0468">A BIAcore&#xae; (surface plasmon resonance device, Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) affinity analysis of the 21B12 antibodies to PCSK9 described in this Example was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
        <p id="p-0470" num="0469">Briefly, the surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using Biacore 2000 optical biosensors (Biacore, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Each individual anti-PCSK9 antibody was immobilized to a research-grade CM5 biosensor chip by amine-coupling at levels that gave a maximum analyte binding response (Rmax) of no more than 200 resonance units (RU). The concentration of PCSK9 protein was varied at 2 fold intervals (the analyte) and was injected over the immobilized antibody surface (at a flow rate of 100 &#x3bc;l/min for 1.5 minutes). Fresh HBS-P buffer (pH 7.4, 0.01 M Hepes, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P-20, Biacore) supplemented with 0.01% BSA was used as binding buffer. Binding affinities of each anti-PCSK9 antibody were measured in separate experiments against each of the human, mouse, and cynomolgus monkey PCSK9 proteins at pH 7.4 (the concentrations used were 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, and 0 nM).</p>
        <p id="p-0471" num="0470">
            In addition, the binding affinities of antibody to human PCSK9 were also measured at pH 6.0 with the pH 6.0 HBS-P buffer (pH 6.0, 0.01 M Hepes, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P-20, Biacore) supplemented with 0.01% BSA. The binding signal obtained was proportional to the free PCSK9 in solution. The dissociation equilibrium constant (K
            <sub>D</sub>
            ) was obtained from nonlinear regression analysis of the competition curves using a dual-curve one-site homogeneous binding model (KinExA&#xae; software, Sapidyne Instruments Inc., Boise, Id.) (n=1 for the 6.0 pH runs). Interestingly, the antibodies appeared to display a tighter binding affinity at the lower pH (where the Kd was 12.5, 7.3, and 29 pM for 31H4, 21B12, and 16F12 respectively).
        </p>
        <p id="p-0472" num="0471">
            Antibody binding kinetic parameters including k
            <sub>a </sub>
            (association rate constant), k
            <sub>d </sub>
            (dissociation rate constant), and K
            <sub>D </sub>
            (dissociation equilibrium constant) were determined using the BIA evaluation 3.1 computer program (BIAcore, Inc. Piscataway, N.J.). Lower dissociation equilibrium constants indicate greater affinity of the antibody for PCSK9. The K
            <sub>D </sub>
            values determined by the BIAcore&#xae; affinity analysis are presented in Table 7.1, shown below.

        <p id="p-0475" num="0474">
            A KinExA&#xae; (Sapidyne Instruments, Inc., Boise, Id.) affinity analysis of 16F12 and 31H4 was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Reacti-Gel&#x2122; (6&#xd7;) (Pierce) was pre-coated with one of human, V5-tagged cyno or His-tagged mouse PCSK9 proteins and blocked with BSA. 10 or 100 pM of either antibody 16F12 or antibody 31H4 and one of the PCSK9 proteins was then incubated with various concentrations (0.1 pM-25 nM) of PCSK9 proteins at room temperature for 8 hours before being passed through the PCSK9-coated beads. The amount of the bead-bound 16F12 or 31H4 was quantified by fluorescently (Cy5) labeled goat anti-human IgG (H+L) antibody (Jackson Immuno Research). The binding signal is proportional to the concentration of free 16F12 or 31H4 at binding equilibrium. Equilibrium dissociation constant (K
            <sub>D</sub>
            ) were obtained from nonlinear regression of the two sets of competition curves using a one-site homogeneous binding model. The KinExA&#xae; Pro software was employed in the analysis. Binding curves generated in this analysis are presented as

        <p id="p-0476" num="0475">
            Both the 16F12 and 31H4 antibodies showed similar affinity to human and cyno PCSK9, but approximately 10-250 fold lower affinity to mouse PCSK9. Of the two antibodies tested using the KinExA&#xae; system, antibody 31H4 showed higher affinity to both human and cyno PCSK9 with 3 and 2 pM K
            <sub>D</sub>
            , respectively. 16F12 showed slightly weaker affinity at 15 pM K
            <sub>D </sub>
            to human PCSK9 and 16 pM K
            <sub>D </sub>

            A BIAcore solution equilibrium binding assay was used to measure the Kd values for ABP 21B12. 21B12.1 showed little signal using KinExA assay, therefore, biacore solution equilibrium assay was applied. Since no significant binding was observed on binding of antibodies to immobilized PCSK9 surface, 21B12 antibody was immobilized on the flow cell 4 of a CM5 chip using amine coupling with density around 7000 RU. Flow cell 3 was used as a background control. 0.3, 1, and 3 nM of human PCSK9 or cyno PCSK9 were mixed with a serial dilutions of 21B12.1 antibody samples (ranged from 0.001&#x2dc;25 nM) in PBS plus 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.005% P20. Binding of the free PCSK9 in the mixed solutions were measured by injecting over the 21B12.1 antibody surface. 100% PCSK9 binding signal on 21B12.1 surface was determined in the absence of mAb in the solution. A decreased PCSK9 binding response with increasing concentrations of mAb indicated that PCSK9 binding to mAb in solution, which blocked PCSK9 from binding to the immobilized peptibody surface. Plotting the PCSK9 binding signal versus mAb concentrations, K
            <sub>D </sub>
            was calculated from three sets of curves (0.3, 1 and 3 nM fixed PCSK9 concentration) using a one-site homogeneous binding model in KinExA Pro&#x2122; software. Although cPCSK9 has lower protein concentration observed from KinExA assay and SDS-gel, its concentration was not adjusted here since the concentration of cPCSK9 was not used for calculation of K

        <p id="p-0482" num="0481">Competition ELISA was used for anti-PCSK9 antibody binning. Briefly, to determine if two antibodies belong to the same epitope bin, one of the antibodies (mAb1) was first coated onto an ELISA plate (NUNC) at 2 &#x3bc;g/ml by overnight incubation. The plate was then washed and blocked with 3% BSA. Meanwhile, 30 ng/ml of biotinylated hPCSK9 was incubated with the second antibody (mAb2) for 2 hours at room temperature. The mixture was applied to coated mAb1 and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The ELISA plate was then washed and incubated with Neutravidin-HRP (Pierce) at 1:5000 dilutions for 1 hour. After another wash, the plate was incubated with TMB substrate and signal was detected at 650 nm using a Titertek plate reader. Antibodies with the same binding profiles were grouped together into the same epitope bin. The results of the antibody binning studies are presented in Table 8.3.</p>

Three mAbs, 16F12, 21B12 and 31H4, were immobilized on flow cells 2, 3 and 4 with density around 8000 RU. 5 nM PCSK9 from human, mouse and cyno were injected over the mAb surfaces to reach around 100 to 500 RU. 10 nM mAbs were then injected over the PCSK9 surface. Binding of three mAbs to three different PCSK9 proteins over the three mAbs were then recorded.</p>

            If the two mAbs had a similar epitope on the antigen, mAb 1 will not show the binding to the antigen already bound to the mAb 2. If the two mAbs have the different epitope on the antigen, mAb1 will show the binding to the antigen bound to the mAb2.

        <p id="p-0486" num="0485">This example provides the IC50 values for two of the antibodies in blocking PCSK9 D374Y's ability to bind to LDLR. Clear 384 well plates (Costar) were coated with 2 micrograms/ml of goat anti-LDL receptor antibody (R&#x26;D Systems) diluted in buffer A (100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4). Plates were washed thoroughly with buffer A and then blocked for 2 hours with buffer B (1% milk in buffer A). After washing, plates were incubated for 1.5 hours with 0.4 micrograms/ml of LDL receptor (R&#x26;D Systems) diluted in buffer C (buffer B supplemented with 10 mM CaCl2). Concurrent with this incubation, 20 ng/ml of biotinylated D374Y PCSK9 was incubated with various concentrations of the 31H4 IgG2, 31H4 IgG4, 21B12 IgG2 or 21B12 IgG4 antibody, which was diluted in buffer A, or buffer A alone (control). The LDL receptor containing plates were washed and the biotinylated D374Y PCSK9/antibody mixture was transferred to them and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Binding of the biotinylated D374Y to the LDL receptor was detected by incubation with streptavidin-HRP (Biosource) at 500 ng/ml in buffer C followed by TMB substrate (KPL).

        <p id="p-0496" num="0495">In respect to the lowered HDL levels, it is noted that one of skill in the art will appreciate that the decrease in HDL in mice is not indicative that an HDL decrease will occur in humans and merely further reflects that the serum cholesterol level in the organism has decreased. It is noted that mice transport the majority of serum cholesterol in high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles which is different to humans who carry most serum cholesterol on LDL particles. In mice the measurement of total serum cholesterol most closely resembles the level of serum HDL-C. Mouse HDL contains apolipoprotein E (apoE) which is a ligand for the LDL receptor (LDLR) and allows it to be cleared by the LDLR. Thus, examining HDL is an appropriate indicator for the present example, in mice (with the understanding that a decrease in HDL is not expected for humans). For example, human HDL, in contrast, does not contain apoE and is not a ligand for the LDLR. As PCSK9 antibodies increase LDLR expression in mouse, the liver can clear more HDL and therefore lowers serum HDL-C levels.</p>

            The present example demonstrates that an antigen binding protein alters the level of LDLR in a subject, as predicted, over time. A Western blot analysis was performed in order to ascertain the effect of antibody 31H4 on LDLR levels. 50-100 mg of liver tissue obtained from the sacrified mice described in Example 13 was homogenized in 0.3 ml of RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) containing complete protease inhibitor (Roche).

        <p id="p-0498" num="0497">In order to assess total serum cholesterol (TC) lowering in wild type (WT) mice via antibody therapy against PCSK9 protein in a 13 day study, the following procedure was performed.</p>
        <p id="p-0499" num="0498">Male WT mice (C57BL/6 strain, aged 9-10 weeks, 17-27 g) obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me.) were fed a normal chow (Harland-Teklad, Diet 2918) through out the duration of the experiment. Mice were administered either anti-PCSK9 antibody 31H4 (2 mg/ml in PBS) or control IgG (2 mg/ml in PBS) at a level of 10 mg/kg through the mouse's tail vein at T=0. Na&#xef;ve mice were also set aside as na&#xef;ve control group.</p>
        <p id="p-0500" num="0499">Dosing groups and time of sacrifice are shown in Table 10. Animals were sacrificed and livers were extracted and prepared as in Example 13.</p>

            When the 6 day experiment was extended to a 13 day study, the same serum cholesterol lowering effect observed in the 6 day study was also observed in the 13 day study. More specifically, animals dosed at 10 mg/kg demonstrated a 31% decrease in serum cholesterol on day 3, which gradually returned to pre-dosing levels by day 13.

            The HDL levels for the animals in Example 15 were also examined. HDL levels decreased in the mice. More specifically, animals dosed at 10 mg/kg demonstrated a 33% decrease in HDL levels on day 3, which gradually returned to pre-dosing levels by day 13.

        <p id="p-0506" num="0505">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, while the antibodies will lower mouse HDL, this is not expected to occur in humans because of the differences in HDL in humans and other organisms (such as mice). Thus, the decrease in mouse HDL is not indicative of a decrease in human HDL.</p>

            In order to verify that the results obtained in the Examples above can be prolonged for further benefits with additional doses, the Experiments in Examples 15 and 16 were repeated with the dosing schedule depicted in

            , while both sets of mice displayed a significant decrease in total serum cholesterol because all of the mice received an initial injection of the 31H4 antigen binding protein, the mice that received additional injections of the 31H4 ABP displayed a continued reduction in total serum cholesterol, while those mice that only received the control injection eventually displayed an increase in their total serum cholesterol.

        <p id="p-0508" num="0507">The results from this example demonstrate that, unlike other cholesterol treatment methods, in which repeated applications lead to a reduction in efficacy because of biological adjustments in the subject, the present approach does not seem to suffer from this issue over the time period examined. Moreover, this suggests that the return of total serum cholesterol or HDL cholesterol levels to baseline, observed in the previous examples is not due to some resistance to the treatment being developed by the subject, but rather the depletion of the antibody availability in the subject.</p>

        <p id="p-0509" num="0508">This example outlines methods for determining which residues in PCSK9 are involved in forming or part of the epitope for the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein to PCSK9.</p>
        <p id="p-0510" num="0509">In order to determine the epitopes to which certain of the ABPs of the present invention bind, the epitopes of the ABPs can be mapped using synthetic peptides derived from the specific PCSK9 peptide sequence.</p>
        <p id="p-0511" num="0510">A SPOTs peptide array (Sigma Genosys) can be used to study the molecular interaction of the human anti-PCSK9 antibodies with their peptide epitope. SPOTs technology is based on the solid-phase synthesis of peptides in a format suitable for the systematic analysis of antibody epitopes. Synthesis of custom arrayed oligopeptides is commerically available from Sigma-Genosys. A peptide array of overlapping oligopeptides derived from the amino-acid sequence of the PCSK9 peptide can be obtained. The array can comprise a series of 12-mer peptides as spots on a polypropylene membrane sheets. The peptide array can span the entire length of the PCSK9 mature sequence. Each consecutive peptide can be offset by 1 residue from the previous one, yielding a nested, overlapping library of arrayed oligopeptides. The membrane carrying the peptides can be reacted with different anti-PCSK9 antibodies (1 micrograms/ml). The binding of the mAbs to the membrane-bound peptides can be assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using HRP-conjugated secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL).</p>
        <p id="p-0512" num="0511">In addition, functional epitopes can be mapped by combinatorial alanine scanning. In this process, a combinatorial alanine-scanning strategy can be used to identify amino acids in the PCSK9 protein that are necessary for interaction with anti-PCSK9 ABPs. To accomplish this, a second set of SPOTs arrays can be used for alanine scanning. A panel of variant peptides with alanine substitutions in each of the 12 residues can be scanned as above. This will allow for the epitopes for the ABPs to the human PCSK9 to be mapped and identified.</p>
        <p id="p-0513" num="0512">In the alternative, given that it is possible that the epitope is conformational, a combination of alanine scanning and/or arginine scanning, antibody FAB/PCSK9 co-crystallization, and limited proteolysis/LC-MS (liquid chromatography mass spec.) can be employed to indentify the epitopes.</p>

At periodic times during the treatment, the patient is monitored to determine whether the symptoms of the disorder has subsided. Following treatment, it is found that patients undergoing treatment with the PCSK9 antibody have reduced serum cholesterol levels, in comparison to patients that are not treated.</p>

In the assay, wells of a microtiter plate, such as a 96-well microtiter plate or a 384-well microtiter plate, are adsorbed for several hours with a first fully human monoclonal antibody directed against PCSK9. The immobilized antibody serves as a capture antibody for any of the PCSK9 that may be present in a test sample. The wells are rinsed and treated with a blocking agent such as milk protein or albumin to prevent nonspecific adsorption of the analyte.</p>
        <p id="p-0518" num="0517">Subsequently the wells are treated with a test sample suspected of containing the PCSK9, or with a solution containing a standard amount of the antigen.

        <p id="p-0519" num="0518">After rinsing away the test sample or standard, the wells are treated with a second fully human monoclonal PCSK9 antibody that is labeled by conjugation with biotin. A monoclonal or mouse or other species origin can also be used. The labeled PCSK9 antibody serves as a detecting antibody. After rinsing away excess second antibody, the wells are treated with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a suitable chromogenic substrate. The concentration of the antigen in the test samples is determined by comparison with a standard curve developed from the standard samples.</p>

            were converted to FASTA formatting for ease in processing comparative alignments and inferring phylogenies. Next, framework regions of these sequences were replaced with an artificial linker sequence (&#x201c;bbbbbbbbbb&#x201d; placeholders, non-specific nucleic acid construct) so that examination of the CDRs alone could be performed without introducing any amino acid position weighting bias due to coincident events (e.g., such as unrelated antibodies that serendipitously share a common germline framework heritage) while still keeping CDRs contiguous within the same sequence corresponding to a V

            sequences of this format were then subjected to sequence similarity alignment interrogation using a program that employs a standard ClutalW-like algorithm (see, Thompson et al., 1994,
            <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>
            22:4673-4680). A gap creation penalty of 8.0 was employed along with a gap extension penalty of 2.0. This program likewise generated phylograms (phylogenic tree illustrations) based on sequence similarity alignments using either UPGMA (unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages) or Neighbor-Joining methods (see, Saitou and Nei, 1987,
            <i>Molecular Biology and Evolution </i>
            4:406-425) to construct and illustrate similarity and distinction of sequence groups via branch length comparison and grouping. Both methods produced similar results but UPGMA-derived trees were ultimately used as the method employs a simpler and more conservative set of assumptions. UPGMA-derived trees were generated where similar groups of sequences were defined as having fewer than 15 substitutions per 100 residues (see, legend in tree illustrations for scale) amongst individual sequences within the group and were used to define consensus sequence collections. The results of the comparisons are depicted in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13J</figref>

        <p id="p-0531" num="0530">To generate mice which over-expressed human PCSK9, three week old WT C57B1/6 mice were injected via tail vein administration with various concentrations of adenoassociated virus (AAV), recombinantly modified to express human PCSK9, to determine the correct titer which would provide a measurable increase of LDL-cholesterol in the mice. Using this particular virus that expressed human PCSK9, it was determined that 4.5&#xd7;10E12 pfu of virus would result in an LDL-cholesterol level of approximately 40 mg/dL in circulating blood (normal levels of LDL in a WT mice are approximately 10 mg/dL). The human PCSK9 levels in these animals was found to be approximately 13 ug/mL. A colony of mice were generated using this injection criteria.</p>
        <p id="p-0532" num="0531">
            One week after injection, mice were assessed for LDL-cholesterol levels, and randomized into different treatment groups. Animals were then administered, via tail vein injection, a single bolus injection of either 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg of 16F12, 21B12, or 31H4 antigen binding proteins. IgG2 ABP was administered in a separate group of animals as a dosing control. Subgroups of animals (n=6-7) were then euthanized at 24 and 48 hours after ABP administration. There were no effects on LDL-cholesterol levels following IgG2 administration at either dose. Both 31H4 and 21B12 demonstrated significant LDL-cholesterol lowering up to and including 48 hours post-administration, as compared to IgG2 control (shown in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>
            at two different doses). 16F12 shows an intermediary LDL-cholesterol lowering response, with levels returning to baseline of approximately 40 mg/dL by the 48 hour time point. This data is consistent with in vitro binding data (Biacore and Kinexa), which shows near equivalent binding affinity between 31H4 and 21B12, and a lesser affinity of 16F12 to human PCSK9.
        </p>
        <p id="p-0533" num="0532">As can be seen in the results, total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were reduced by the PCSK9 ABPs in the model (both total and HDL-C are elevated above WT mice due to the overexpression of PCSK9). While cholesterol lowering in this model appears to occur over a relatively short period of time, this is believed to be due to the levels of human PCSK9 that are present, which are supraphysiologically high in this model. In addition, given that the expression is governed by AAV, there is no regulation of PCSK9 expression. In these figures, (*) denotes a P&#x3c;0.05, and (**) denotes a P&#x3c;0.005 as compared to LDL-cholesterol levels observed in IgG2 control injected animals at the same time point. The 13 microgram/ml level of serum human PCSK9 in the mice corresponds to an approximately 520-fold increase above the endogenous mouse PCSK9 levels (&#x2dc;25 ng/ml), and an approximately 75-fold increase above average human serum levels (&#x2dc;175 ng/ml). Thus, the antigen binding proteins should be even more effective in humans.</p>
        <p id="p-0534" num="0533">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the above results demonstrate that appropriateness of the mouse model for testing the antigen binding protein's ability to alter serum cholesterol in a subject. One of skill in the art will also recognize that the use of mouse HDL to monitor serum cholesterol levels in a mouse, while useful for monitoring mouse serum cholesterol levels, is not indicative of the ABPs impact on human HDL in humans. For example, Cohen et al. (&#x201c;Sequence variations in PCSK9, low LDL, and protection against coronary heart disease&#x201d;, N Engl J Med, 354:1264-1272, 2006) demonstrated the lack of any effect of the PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations on human HDL levels (the entirety of which is incorporated by reference). Thus, one of skill in the art will appreciate that the ability of the ABP to lower mouse HDL (which lack LDL) is not indicative of the ABP's ability to lower human HDL. Indeed, as shown by Cohen, this is unlikely to occur for neutralizing antibodies in humans.</p>

            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>
            , the heavy chain CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 are most directly involved in the antigen binding protein's binding to the epitope, with the CDRs from the light chain being relatively far away from the epitope. As such, it is probable that larger variations in the light chain CDRs are possible, without unduly interfering with the binding of the antigen binding protein to PCSK9. In some embodiments, residues in the structures that directly interact are conserved (or alternatively conservatively replaced) while residues that are not directly interacting with one another can be altered to a greater extent. As such, one of skill in the art, given the present teachings, can predict which residues and areas of the antigen binding proteins can be varied without unduly interfering with the antigen binding protein's ability to bind to PCSK9. For example, those residues that are located closest to PCSK9 when the antigen binding protein is bound to PCSK9 are those that likely play a more important role in the binding of the antigen binding protein to PCSK9. As above, these residues can be divided into those that are within 5 angstroms of PCSK9 and those that are between 5 and 8 angstroms. Specific core 31H4 amino acid residues of the interaction interface with PCSK9 were defined as 31H4 residues that are within 5 &#x212b; of the PCSK9 protein. For the heavy chain, the residues that are within 5 angstroms include the following: T28, S30, S31, Y32, S54, S55, S56, Y57, I58, S59, Y60, N74, A75, R98, Y100, F102, W103, S104, A105, Y106, Y107, D108, A109, and D111. For the light chain, those residues that are within 5 angstroms include the following: L48, S51, Y93, and S98. For the heavy chain, those residues that are 5-8 &#x212b; from the PCSK9 protein include the following: G26, F27, F29, W47, S50, I51, S52, S53, K65, F68, T69, I70, S71, R72, D73, K76, N77, D99, D101, F110, and V112. For the light chain, those residues that are within 5-8 angstroms of PCSK9 include A31, G32, Y33, D34, H36, Y38, I50, G52, N55, R56, P57, S58, D94, S95, S96, L97, G99, and S100.

        <p id="p-0546" num="0545">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the results from Example 29 demonstrate where antibodies to PCSK9 can interact on PCSK9 and still block PCSK9 from interacting with EGFa (and thus LDLR). Thus, antigen binding proteins that interact with any of these PCSK9 residues, or that block any of these residues (e.g., from other antigen binding proteins that bind to these residues), can be useful as antibodies that inhibit the interaction of PCSK9 and EGFa (and LDLR accordingly). Thus, in some embodiments, antigen binding proteins that interact with any of the above residues or interact with residues that are within 5 &#x212b; of the above residues are contemplated to provide useful inhibition PCSK9 binding to LDLR.

            The structure of the ternary complex (PCSK9/31H4/21B12) from the above example was overlaid on the PCSK9/EGFa structure (determined as described in Example 28) and the result of this combination is depicted in

            . This figure demonstrates areas on PCSK9 which can be usefully targeted to inhibit PCSK9 interaction with EGFa. The figure shows that both 31H4 and 21B12 partially overlap with the position of the EGFa domain of LDLR and sterically interfere with its binding to PCSK9. In addition, as can be seen in the structures, 21B12 directly interacts with a subset of amino acid residues that are specifically involved in binding to the LDLR EGFa domain.

        <p id="p-0553" num="0552">As noted above, analysis of the crystal structures identified specific amino acids involved in the interaction between PCSK9 and the partner proteins (the core and boundary regions of the interface on the PCSK9 surface) and the spatial requirements of these partner proteins to interact with PCSK9. The structures suggest ways to inhibit the interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR. First, as noted above, binding an agent to PCSK9 where it shares residues in common with the binding site of the EGFa domain of the LDLR would inhibit the interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR. Second, an agent that binds outside of the residues in common can sterically interfere with the EGFa domain or regions of the LDLR that are either N- or C-terminal to the EGFa domain to prevent the interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR.</p>
        <p id="p-0554" num="0553">In some embodiments, the residues that are involved in both EGFa binding and are close to the areas where the above noted antigen binding proteins bind are especially useful for manipulating PCSK9 binding to LDLR.

As such, one of skill in the art will readily be able to identify antigen binding molecules that can similarly reduce the binding between EGFa (including LDLR) and PCSK9 by identifying other antigen binding molecules that bind at or near at least one of the same locations on PCSK9. While the relevant locations (or epitopes) on PCSK9 are identified in the figures and the present description, it can also be advantageous to describe these sites as being within a set distance from residues that have been identified as close to the EGFa binding site. In some embodiments, an antigen binding molecule will bind to or within 30 angstroms of one or more of the following residues (numbering in reference to SEQ ID NO: 3): S153, I154, P155, R194, D238, A239, I369, S372, D374, C375, T377, C378, F379, V380, S381, W156, N157, L158, E159, H193, E195, H229, R237, G240, K243, D367, I368, G370, A371, S373, S376, Q382, W72, F150, A151, Q152, T214, R215, F216, H217, A220, S221, K222, S225, H226, C255, Q256, G257, K258, N317, F318, T347, L348, G349, T350, L351, E366, D367, D374, V380, S381, Q382, S383, G384, K69, D70, P71, S148, V149, D186, T187, E211, D212, G213, R218, Q219, C223, D224, G227, H229, L253, N254, G259, P288, A290, G291, G316, R319, Y325, V346, G352, T353, G365, I368, I369, S372, S373, C378, F379, T385, S386, Q387, S153, S188, I189, Q190, S191, D192, R194, E197, G198, R199, V200, D224, R237, D238, K243, S373, D374, S376, T377, F379, I154, T187, H193, E195, I196, M201, V202, C223, T228, S235, G236, A239, G244, M247, I369, S372, C375, or C378.

        <p id="p-0560" num="0559">In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule binds within 30, 30-25, 25-20, 20-15, 15-8,8,8-5,5,5-4, 4 or less angstroms from one or more of the above residues. In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule, when bound to PCSK9, is within at least one of the above distances, for more than one of the above noted residues. For example, in some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule is within one of the recited distances (e.g., 30, 30-25, 25-20, 20-15, 15-8,8,8-5,5,5-4, 4 or less) for at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-35, 35-40, 40-45, 45-50, 50-55, 55-60, 60-65, 65-70, 70-75 or more of the above residues. In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule is within one of the recited distances for at least 1-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-95, 95-99, 99-100% of the residues identified in each group of subgroup thereof (such as only those surface residues in the group). Unless specifically stated otherwise, the distance between the antigen binding molecule and PCSK9 is the shortest distance between the covalently bonded atom on PCSK9 and the covalently bonded atom of the antigen binding molecule that are the closest atoms of PCSK9 and the antigen binding molecule. Similarly, unless specifically stated otherwise, the distance between a residue (on the antigen binding molecule or PCSK9) and another protein (either PCSK9 or the antigen binding molecule respectively), is the distance from the closest point on the identified residue to the closest covalently bonded part of the other protein. In some embodiments, the distance can be measured from the backbone of the amino acid chains. In some embodiments, the distance can be measured between an edge of the paratope and an edge (closest to one another) of the epitope. In some embodiments, the distance can be measured between the center of the surface of the paratope and the center of the surface of the epitope. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the present description is applicable for each of the individual sets of residues listed herein. For example, the above ranges are contemplated generally and specifically for the 8 angstrom residues listed in Examples 28-32 and the 5 angstrom residues listed in Examples 28-32.</p>
        <p id="p-0561" num="0560">In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule binds to a surface on PCSK9 that is bound by at least one of EGFa, 21B12, or 31H4. In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule binds to PCSK9 at a location that overlaps with the interaction locations between PCSK9 and EFGa, Ab 31H4, and/or Ab 21B12 (as described in the above examples and figures). In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule binds to PCSK9 at a position that is further away from one of the above recited residues. In some embodiments, such an antigen binding molecule can still be an effective neutralizing antigen binding molecule.</p>
        <p id="p-0562" num="0561">
            In some embodiments, the structure of the catalytic domain of PCSK9 can be described as generally being triangular (as shown in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>
            ). The first side of the triangle is shown as being bound by 31H4. The second side of the triangle is shown as being bound by 21B12, and the third side of the triangle is positioned toward the bottom of the page, immediately above the &#x201c;FIG.

            A&#x201d; label. In some embodiments, antigen binding molecules that bind to the first and/or second sides of the catalytic domain of PCSK9 can be useful as neutralizing antibodies as they can either directly or sterically interfere with EGFa's binding to PCSK9. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, when the antigen binding molecules are large enough, such as a full antibody, the antigen binding molecule need not directly bind to the EGFa binding site in order to interfere with the binding of EGFa to PCSK9.
        </p>
        <p id="p-0563" num="0562">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, while the EGFa domain of the LDLR has been used in many of the examples, the models and structures are still applicable to how the full length LDLR protein will interact with PCSK9. Indeed, the additional structure present on the full length LDLR protein presents additional protein space that can further be blocked by one of the antigen binding molecules. As such, if the antigen binding molecule blocks or inhibits binding of EGFa to PCSK9, it will likely be at least as, if not more, effective with the full length LDLR protein. Similarly, antigen binding molecules that are within a set distance or block various residues that are relevant for inhibiting EGFa binding, will likely be as effective, if not more effective, for the full length LDLR.</p>
        <p id="p-0564" num="0563">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, any molecule that blocks or binds to the above noted PCSK9 residues (or within the recited distances), or that inhibits one or more of the interactions noted in the above examples and figures, can be used to inhibit the interaction of EGFa (or LDLR generally) and PCSK9. As such, the molecule need not be limited to an antigen binding &#x201c;protein,&#x201d; as any antigen binding molecule can also serve the required purpose. Examples of antigen binding molecules include aptamers, which can be either oligonucleic acid or peptide molecules. Other examples of antigen binding molecules include avimers, peptibodies, small molecules and polymers, and modified versions of EGFa that can increase its affinity to PCSK9 and/or half-life, such as mutation of amino acids, glycosylation, pegylation, Fc fusions, and avimer fusions. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in some embodiments LDLR is not an antigen binding molecule. In some embodiments, binding subsections of LDLR are not antigen binding molecules, e.g., EGFa. In some embodiments, other molecules through which PCSK9 signals in vivo are not antigen binding molecules. Such embodiments will be explicitly identified as such.</p>

This construct had a TEV protease cleavage site inserted between PCSK9 residues 449 and 450. For the full length N555A variant for crystallography, the PCSK9 31-454 fragment, and the PCSK9 449TEV variant for crystalography, the post rTEV protein product also included an initial GAMG sequence. Thus, post rTEV cleavage, these proteins were GAMG-PCSK9. Furthermore, the PCSK9 449TEV protein included the sequence &#x201c;ENLYFQ&#x201d; (SEQ ID NO: 403) inserted between positions H449 and G450 of SEQ ID NO: 3. After cleavage with rTEV, the PCSK9 ProCat protein generated from this construct was GAMG-PCSK9 (31-449)-ENLYFQ and the V domain generated from this construct was PCSK9 (450-692) of SEQ ID NO: 3.

        <p id="p-0583" num="0582">Core interaction interface amino acids were determined as being all amino acid residues with at least one atom less than or equal to 5 &#x212b; from the PCSK9 partner protein. 5 &#x212b; was chosen as the core region cutoff distance to allow for atoms within a van der Waals radius plus a possible water-mediated hydrogen bond. Boundary interaction interface amino acids were determined as all amino acid residues with at least one atom less than or equal to 8 &#x212b; from the PCSK9 partner protein but not included in the core interaction list. Less than or equal to 8 &#x212b; was chosen as the boundary region cutoff distance to allow for the length of an extended arginine amino acid. Amino acids that met these distance criteria were calculated with the program PyMOL (DeLano, W. L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. (Palo Alto, 2002)). Distances were calculated using the V domain &#x201c;A&#x201d; and 31A4 &#x201c;L1,H1&#x201d; complex.</p>

        <p id="p-0586" num="0585">Analysis of the structure shows where this antibody interacts with PCSK9 and demonstrated that antibodies that do not bind to the LDLR binding surface of PCSK9 can still inhibit the degradation of LDLR that is mediated through PCSK9 (when the results are viewed in combination with Example 40 and 41 below). In addition, analysis of the crystal structure allows for identification of specific amino acids involved in the interaction between PCSK9 and the 31A4 antibody. Furthermore, the core and boundary regions of the interface on the PCSK9 surface were also determined. Specific core PCSK9 amino acid residues of the interaction interface with 31A4 were defined as PCSK9 residues that are within 5 &#x212b; of the 31A4 protein. The core residues are T468, R469, M470, A471, T472, R496, R499, E501, A502, Q503, R510, H512, F515, P540, P541, A542, E543, H565, W566, E567, V568, E569, R592, and E593. Boundary PCSK9 amino acid residues of the interaction interface with 31A4 were defined as PCSK9 residues that are 5-8 &#x212b; from the 31A4 protein. The boundary residues are as follows: S465, G466, P467, A473, I474, R476, G497, E498, M500, G504, K506, L507, V508, A511, N513, A514, G516, V536, T538, A539, A544, T548, D570, L571, H591, A594, S595, and H597.

            The antibodies that are described in the coordinates were raised in
            <i>E. coli </i>

The first residue in the variable region was a glutamic acid instead of a glutamine for the heavy and light chains of 21B12 and for the light chain for 31H4. In addition to the differences in the sequence of variable region, there were also some differences in the constant region of the antibodies described by the coordinates (again due to the fact that the antibody was raised in

            In regard to 31A4, while it also has the same distinctions noted above, there are three additional differences. As shown in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>
            , there are two additional amino acids at the start, which comes from incomplete processing of the signal peptide in

            expression. In addition, there is one additional substitution in the 31A4 heavy chain constant region when compared to SEQ ID NO: 155, which is the adjustment of a L (in SEQ ID NO: 155) to a H. Finally, 31A4 does have a glutamine as the initial amino acid of the Fab, rather than the adjustment to glutamic acid noted above for 21B12 and 31H4.

Individual bead codes of streptavidin-coated Luminex beads was incubated in 100 ul 0.5 ug/ml biotinylated monovalent mouse-anti-human IgG capture antibody (BD Pharmingen, #555785) for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark, then washed 3&#xd7; with PBSA, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) plus 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Each bead code was separately incubated with 100 ul 2 ug/ml anti-PCSK9 antibody (Coating Antibody) for 1 hour then washed 3&#xd7; with PBSA. The beads were pooled then dispensed to a 96-well filter plate (Millipore, #MSBVN1250). 100 ul of 2 ug/ml purified PCSK9 protein was added to half the wells. Buffer was added to the other half as control. The reaction was incubated for 1 hour then washed. 100 ul of a 2 ug/ml anti-PCSK9 antibody (Detection Ab) was added to all the wells, incubated for 1 hour then washed. An irrelevant human-IgG (Jackson, #009-000-003) was run as another control. 20 ul PE-conjugated monovalent mouse-anti-human IgG (BD Pharmingen, #555787) was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour then washed.

Bin 5, in this example, is presented as a &#x201c;catch all&#x201d; bin to describe those ABPs that do not fit into the other bins. Thus, the above identified ABPs in each of the binds are representative of different types of epitope locations on PCSK9, some of which overlap with each other.</p>
        <p id="p-0602" num="0601">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, if the reference ABP prevents the binding of the probe ABP then the antibodies are said to be in the same bin. The order in which the ABPs are employed can be important. If ABP A is employed as the reference ABP and blocks the binding of ABP B the converse is not always true: ABP B used as the reference ABP will not necessarily block ABP A. There are a number of factors in play here: the binding of an ABP can cause conformational changes in the target which prevent the binding of the second ABP, or epitopes which overlap but do not completely occlude each other may allow for the second ABP to still have enough high-affinity interactions with the target to allow binding. ABPs with a much higher affinity may have a greater ability to bump a blocking ABP out of the way. In general, if competition is observed in either order the ABPs are said to bin together, and if both ABPs can block each other then it is likely that the epitopes overlap more completely.</p>

            The present example demonstrates whether or not the epitopes for the examined ABPs were linear or conformational. Denaturing reducing and denaturing non-reducing western blots were run to determine which antibodies have a conformational epitope. Antibodies that bind to a denaturing reducing western blot have a linear epitope and are not conformational. The results are presented in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>
            and

            . For the blot, 0.5 ug/lane of purified full-length human PCSK9 was run on a 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel and MES SDS Running Buffer. 1 ug/ml anti-PCSK9 antibodies, except 0.5 ug/ml 31G11, were used to probe the blot. 1:5000 donkey-anti-human-IR700 secondary was used and read on a LiCOR instrument. Antibody 13H1 bound to a linear epitope on the pro-domain of PCSK9. All other antibodies displayed results that were consistent with conformational epitopes. These gels split apart the pro-domain from the rest of the protein, and the pro domain ran at about 15 kDa. In addition, 3C4 and 31A4 appeared to bind to conformational epitopes which were preserved by disulfide bonds, as these antibodies bound to PCSK-9 under denaturing conditions where the disulfide bonds had been preserved (left) but reducing the samples (right) eliminated binding.

        <p id="p-0604" num="0603">Representative ABPs from each bin (from Example 37) were selected for further epitope analysis. An arginine/glutamic acid-scanning strategy was performed for mapping ABP binding to PCSK9. By way of background, this method determines if a residue is part of the structural epitope, meaning those residues in the antigen which contact or are buried by the antibody. Arginine and glutamic acid sidechains are charged and bulky and can disrupt antibody binding even if the mutated residue is not directly involved in antibody binding.</p>
        <p id="h-0121" num="0000">Residue Selection</p>
        <p id="p-0605" num="0604">
            The crystal structure of PCSK9 was used to select the residues to be mutated for epitope mapping. The method used to choose residues to mutate involved both computational mechanisms and interactive structure analysis. The PCSK9 structure contained gaps of missing residues and was missing 30 amino acids in the N- (i.e., the signal sequence) and 10 amino acids in the C-termini. The internal missing residues were modeled onto the structure, but the N- and C-terminal missing residues were not. The solvent exposure ratio for each residue was calculated: the surface area of each residue in the context of the protein (SA1) was divided by the surface area of the residue in a trimer with flanking glycines (SA2) with a conserved backbone structure. Residues with solvent exposure ratio greater than 10% (R10) were selected as well as the 40 missing terminal residues. From these, prolines and glycines with positive &#x3a6; angles were excluded to reduce the possibility of misfolding. The number of residues to be mutated in the V domain was reduced by using a solvent exposure ratio of 37% along with visual inspection of the entire protein to bring the total number of mutations to 285. Various orientations of the surface of PCSK9 with these various classes identifies are shown in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A-25F</figref>

            Once the residues to be altered were identified, the various residues were altered. Human PCSK9 was cloned into the pTT5 vector with a C-terminal Flag-His tag. Mutants were made from this original construct by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange II kit from Stratagene. Sense and anti-sense oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were designed using Amgen's MutaGenie software. All PCSK9 constructs were expressed in transiently-transfected 293-6E cells in 24-well plates and re-racked into three 96-well plates with a non-mutated PCSK9 control (wild-type, WT) in each plate. Expression levels and integrity of the recombinant proteins in conditioned media were checked by Western blot. Of the 285 mutants originally selected, 41 failed in cloning or expression. 244 mutants were used for epitope mapping. An alignment of the PCSK9 parent sequence and a representative PCSK9 sequence with the 244 mutated residues is shown in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>

        <p id="p-0608" num="0607">Epitopes can be further defined as structural or functional. Functional epitopes are generally a subset of the structural epitopes and have those residues that directly contribute to the affinity of the interaction (e.g. hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions). Structural epitopes can be thought of as the patch of the target which is covered by the antibody.</p>
        <p id="p-0609" num="0608">The scanning mutagenesis employed was an arginine and glutamic acid scan. These two sidechains were chosen due to their large steric bulk and their charge, which allows mutations that occur in the structural epitope to have a greater effect on antibody binding. Arginine was generally employed except when the WT reside was arginine, and in these cases the residue was mutated to glutamic acid to switch the charge.</p>
        <p id="p-0610" num="0609">For the purpose of epitope mapping, a bead-based multiplexed assay was used to measure antibody binding to PCSK9 and PCSK9 mutants simultaneously. Antibody binding to mutants was then compared to its binding to the wild-type in the same well. The variants were split into three groups: Group 1: 81 variants+2 wt controls+1 negative control+1 other PCSK9 supernatant; Group 2: 81 variants+2 wt controls+2 negative controls; and Group 3: 82 variants+2 wt control+1 negative control.</p>
        <p id="p-0611" num="0610">The assay was run as follows: 85 sets of color-coded strepavidin-coated LumAvidin beads (Luminex) were bound with biotinylated anti-pentaHis antibody (Qiagen, #1019225) for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) then washed three times in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20. Each color-coded bead set was then allowed to bind to a PCSK9 mutant, wild-type, or negative control in 150 ul supernatant overnight at 4&#xb0; C.</p>
        <p id="p-0612" num="0611">The color-coded bead sets, each associated to a specific protein, were washed and pooled. At this point, there were 3 pools of 85 bead sets, one pool for each group of mutants and controls. The beads from each pool were aliquoted to 24 wells (3 columns) of a 96-well filter plate (Millipore, #MSBVN1250). 100 ul of anti-PCSK9 antibodies in 4-fold dilutions were added to nine columns for triplicate points and incubated for 1 hour at RT and washed. 100 ul of 1:200 dilution phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc (Jackson Immunoresearch, #109-116-170) was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at RT and washed.</p>
        <p id="p-0613" num="0612">
            Beads were resuspended in 1% BSA in PBS, shaken for 10 mins and read on the BioPlex instrument (Bio-Rad). The instrument identifies each bead by its color-code thereby identifying the specific protein associated with the color code. At the same time, it measures the amount of antibody bound to the beads by fluorescence intensity of the PE dye. Antibody binding to each mutant can then be compared directly its binding to the wild type in the same pool. IL-17R chimera E was used as a negative control. A summary of all of the mutants examined is shown in Table 39.1 (with reference to the sequence numbering used in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 26</figref>
            ).

            Bead Variability Study
        </p>
        <p id="p-0615" num="0614">Before running the epitope mapping binding assay, a validation experiment was conducted to assess the &#x201c;bead region&#x201d; to &#x201c;bead region&#x201d; (B-B) variability. In the validation experiment, all beads were conjugated with the same wild type control protein. Therefore, the difference between beads regions was due to purely B-B variance and was not confounded by difference between wild type and mutant proteins. The titration of antibody was run with twelve replications in different wells.</p>
        <p id="p-0616" num="0615">The objective of this statistical analysis was to estimate the B-B variability of the estimated EC50 of binding curves. The estimated B-B standard deviation (SD) was then used to build the EC50 confidence intervals of wild type and mutant proteins during curve comparison experiments.</p>
        <p id="p-0617" num="0616">A four-parameter logistic model was fitted to the binding data for each bead region. The resulting file, containing curve quality control (QC) results and parameter estimates for top (max), bottom (min), Hillslope (slope), and natural log of EC50 (xmid) of the curves, was used as the raw data for the analysis. B-B variability for each parameter was then estimated by fitting mixed effect model using SAS PROC MIXED procedure. Only curves with &#x201c;good&#x201d; QC status were included in the analysis. The final mixed effect model included only residual (i.e. individual bead regions) as random effect. Least squares means (LS-mean) for each parameter were estimated by the mixed effect model as well. B-B SD was calculated by taking square root of B-B variance. Fold change between LS-mean+2SD and LS-mean&#x2212;2SD, which represent approximately upper and lower 97.5 percentile of the population, was also calculated. The results are displayed in Table 39.2</p>

        <p id="p-0619" num="0618">A residue was considered part of the structural epitope (a &#x201c;hit&#x201d;) when mutating it to arginine or glutamic acid alters antibody binding. This is seen as a shift in the EC50 or a reduction of maximum signal compared to antibody binding to wild type. Statistical analyses of antibody binding curves to wild type and mutants were used to identify statistically significant EC50 shifts. The analysis takes into consideration variation in the assay and curve fitting.</p>

        <p id="p-0620" num="0619">The EC50 and Bmax values were generated from a Weighted 4-Parameter Logistical model fitted to the binding data using S-PLUS with VarPower software (Insightful Corporation, Seattle Wash.). The EC50s of the mutant binding curves and wild type binding curves were compared. Statistically significant differences were identified as hits for further consideration. The curves with &#x201c;nofit&#x201d; or &#x201c;badfit&#x201d; flags were excluded from the analysis.</p>
        <p id="p-0621" num="0620">The Variations in EC50 Estimates</p>
        <p id="p-0622" num="0621">Two sources of variations were considered in the comparison of EC50 estimates, variation from the curve fit and the bead-bead variation. Wild types and mutants were linked to different beads, hence their difference are confounded with the bead-bead difference (described above). The curve fit variation was estimated by the standard error of the log EC50 estimates. Bead-bead variation was experimentally determined using an experiment where wild type controls were linked to each one of the beads (described above). The bead variation in EC50 estimates of wild type binding curve from this experiment was used to estimate the bead-bead variation in the actual epitope mapping experiment.</p>
        <p id="p-0623" num="0622">Testing for EC50 Shift Between Mutants and Wild Type</p>
        <p id="p-0624" num="0623">The comparisons of two EC50s (in log scale) was conducted using Student's t-test. The t-statistic was calculated as the ratio between delta (the absolute differences between EC50 estimates) and the standard deviation of delta. The variance of delta was estimated by the sum of the three components, variance estimate of EC50 for mutant and wild type curves in the nonlinear regression and two times the bead-bead variance estimated from a separate experiment. The multiple of two for the bead-bead variance was due to the assumption that both mutant and wild type beads had the same variance. The degree of freedom of the standard deviation of delta was calculated using the Satterthwaite's (1946) approximation. Individual p-values and confidence intervals (95% and 99%) were derived based on Student's t distribution for each comparison. In the case of multiple wild type controls, a conservative approach was taken by picking the wild type control that was most similar to the mutant, i.e., picking the ones with the largest p-values.</p>
        <p id="p-0625" num="0624">Multiplicity adjustments were important to control the false positive(s) while conducting a large number of tests simultaneously. Two forms of multiplicity adjustment were implemented for this analysis: family wise error (FWE) control and false discovery rate (FDR) control. The FWE approach controls the probability that one or more hits are not real; FDR approach controls the expected proportion of false positive among the selected hits. The former approach is more conservative and less powerful than the latter one. There are many methods available for both approaches, for this analysis, the Hochberg's (1988) method for FWE analysis and Benjamini-Hochberg's (1995) FDR method for FDR analysis were selected. Adjusted p-values for both approaches were calculated.</p>

        <p id="p-0627" num="0626">EC50 Shift</p>
        <p id="p-0628" num="0627">Mutations whose EC50 is significantly different from wild type, e.g., having a False Discovery Rate adjusted p-value for the whole assay of 0.01 or less, were considered part of the structural epitope. All the hits also had a Familywise type I error rate adjusted p-value for each antibody of less than 0.01 except residue R185E for antibody 31H4 which had an FWE adjusted p-value per antibody of 0.0109. The residues in the structural epitope of the various antibodies determined by EC50 shift are shown in Table 39.3 (point mutations are with reference to SEQ ID NO: 1 and 303)</p>

            Maximum Signal Reduction
        </p>
        <p id="p-0630" num="0629">The percent maximum signal was calculated using the maximum signal from the curve fitting (BmaxPerWT) and raw data point (RawMaxPerWT). Mutations that reduced the antibody binding maximum signal by &#x2267;70% as compared to to wild type signal or that reduced the signal of one antibody compared to other antibodies by &#x3e;50% when all other antibodies are at least 40% of wild type were considered hits and part of the epitope. Table 39.4 displays the residues that are in the structural epitope (italics) as determined by reduction of maximum signal.</p>

            depicts the 21B12 epitope hits, as mapped onto a crystal structure of PCSK9 with the 21B12 antibody. The structure identifies PCSK9 residues as follows: light gray indicates those residues that were not mutated (with the exception of those residues that are explicitly indicated on the structure) and darker gray indicates those residues mutated (a minority of which failed to express). Residues that are explicitly indicated were tested (regardless of the shading indicated on the figure) and resulted in a significant change in EC50 and/or Bmax The epitope hits were based on Bmax shift. In this figure, 31H4 is behind 21 B12.

The epitope hits were based on the EC50 shift. 31A4 antibody is known to bind to the V-domain of PCSK9, which appears consistent with the results presented in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27C</figref>
            .

            3C4 does not compete with 21B12 and 31H4 in the binning assay. 3C4 binds to the V-domain in the domain binding assay (see results from Example 40,

        <p id="p-0640" num="0639">While there were approximately a dozen mutants that could have been expected to have an effect on binding (based upon the crystal structure), the present experiment demonstrated that, surprisingly, they did not. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the results presented above are in good agreement with the crystal structures and PCSK-9's binding of these antibodies. This demonstrates that the provided structural and corresponding functional data adequately identifies the key residues and areas of interaction of the neutralizing ABPs and PCSK9. Thus, variants of the ABPs that possess the ability to bind to the above noted areas are adequately provided by the present description.</p>
        <p id="p-0641" num="0640">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, while the B-max drop and EC50 shift hits can be considered manifestations of the same phenomenon, strictly speaking, a B-max drop alone does not reflect a loss of affinity per se but, rather, the destruction of some percentage of the epitope of an antibody. Although there is no overlap in the hits determined by B-max and EC50, mutations with a strong affect on binding may not allow for the generation of a useful binding curve and hence, no EC50 can be determined for such variants.</p>
        <p id="p-0642" num="0641">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, ABPs in the same bin (with the exception of bin 5, which as noted above, is a general catch all bin) likely bind to overlapping sites on the target protein. As such, the above epitopes and relevant residues can generally be extended to all such ABPs in the same bin.</p>
        <p id="p-0643" num="0642">To further examine the above results in regard to ABP 31H4, position E181R, which, according to the above crystal structure, was predicted to interact with R185 to form part of the surface that interacts with the ABP, was also altered (E181R). The results, while not statistically significant on their own, were, when combined with the crystal structure, demonstrative of 31H4 interacting with E181R (data not shown). Thus, position 181 also appears to form part of the epitope for the 31H4 ABP.</p>
        <p id="p-0644" num="0643">As noted above, the above binding data and epitope characterization references a PCSK9 sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) that does not include the first 30 amino acids of PCSK9. Thus, the numbering system of this protein fragment, and the SEQ ID NO:s that refer to this fragment, are shifted by 30 amino acids compared to the data and experiments that used a full length PCSK9 numbering system (such as that used in the crystal study data described above). Thus, to compare these results, an extra 30 amino acids should be added to the positions in each of the above epitope mapping results. For example, position 207 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (or SEQ ID NO: 303), correlates to position 237 of SEQ ID NO: 3 (the full length sequence, and the numbering system used throughout the rest of the specification). Table 39.6 outlines how the above noted positions, which reference SEQ ID NO: 1 (and/or SEQ ID NO: 303) correlate with SEQ ID NO: 3 (which includes the signal sequence).</p>

            Clear, 96 well maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated overnight with 2 ug/ml of various anti-PCSK9 antibodies diluted in PBS. Plates were washed thoroughly with PBS/0.05% Tween-20 and then blocked for two hours with 3% BSA/PBS. After washing, plates were incubated for two hours with either full length PCSK9 (aa 31-692 SEQ ID NO: 3, procat PCSK9 (aa 31-449 SEQ ID NO: 3) or v-domain PCSK9 (aa 450-692 of SEQ ID NO: 3) diluted in general assay diluent (Immunochemistry Technologies, LLC). Plates were washed and a rabbit polyclonal biotinylated anti-PCSK9 antibody (D8774), which recognizes the procat and v-domain as well as full-length PCSK9, was added at 1 ug/ml (in 1% BSA/PBS). Bound full-length, procat or v-domain PCSK9 was detected by incubation with neutravidin-HRP (Thermo Scientific) at 200 ng/ml (in 1% BSA/PBS) followed by TMB substrate (KPL) and absorbance measurement at 650 nm. The results, presented in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref>
            , demonstrate the ability of the various ABS to bind to various parts of PCSK9. As shown in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</figref>
            , ABP 31A4 binds to the V domain of PCSK9.

        <p id="p-0649" num="0648">The present example demonstrates how to identify and characterize an antigen binding protein that is non-competitive with LDLR for binding with PCSK9, but is still neutralizing towards PCSK9 activity. In other words, such an antigen binding protein will not block PCSK9 from binding to LDLR, but will prevent or reduce PCSK9 mediated LDLR degradation.</p>
        <p id="p-0650" num="0649">
            Clear, 384 well plates (Costar) were coated with 2 ug/ml of goat anti-LDL receptor antibody (R&#x26;D Systems) diluted in buffer A (100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4). Plates were washed thoroughly with buffer A and then blocked for 2 hours with buffer B (1% milk in buffer A). After washing, plates were incubated for 1.5 hours with 0.4 ug/ml of LDL receptor (R&#x26;D Systems) diluted in buffer C (buffer B supplemented with 10 mM CaCl
            <sub>2</sub>
            ). Concurrent with this incubation, 20 ng/ml of biotinylated D374Y PCSK9 was incubated with 100 ng/ml of antibody diluted in buffer A or buffer A alone (control). The LDL receptor containing plates were washed and the biotinylated D374Y PCSK9/antibody mixture was transferred to them and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Binding of the biotinylated D374Y to the LDL receptor was detected by incubation with streptavidin-HRP (Biosource) at 500 ng/ml in buffer C followed by TMB substrate (KPL). The signal was quenched with 1N HCl and the absorbance read at 450 nm. The results are presented in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28C</figref>
            , which shows that while ABP 31H4 inhibits LDLR binding, ABP 31A4 does not inhibit LDLR binding to PCSK9. In combination with the results from Example 40 and shown in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref>
            , it is clear that 31A4 ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9 and does not block the interaction of PCSK9 with LDLR.
        </p>
        <p id="p-0651" num="0650">
            Next, the Ability of ABP 31A4 to serve as a neutralizing ABP was further confirmed via a cell LDL uptake assay (as described in the examples above). The results of this LDL uptake assay are presented in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28D</figref>
            . As shown in
            <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28D</figref>
            , ABP 31A4 displays significant PCSK9 neutralizing ability. Thus, in light of Example 40 and the present results, it is clear that ABPs can bind to PCSK9 without blocking the PCSK9 and LDLR binding interaction, while still being useful as neutralizing PCSK9 ABPs.
