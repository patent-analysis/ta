In particular, the present invention provides antibodies having specific complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and improved properties over other antibodies which recognize CEACAM1.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The transmembrane protein Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1, also known as biliary glycoprotein (BGP), CD66a and C-CAM1), is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family (CEA) that also belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. CEACAM1 interacts with other known CEACAM proteins, including CD66a (CEACAM1), CD66e (CEACAM6) and CD66e (CEACAM5, CEA) proteins. It is expressed on a wide spectrum of cells, ranging from epithelial cells to those of hemopoietic origin (e.g. immune cells).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many different functions have been attributed to the CEACAM1 protein. It was shown that the CEACAM1 protein is over expressed in some carcinomas of colon, prostate, as well as other types of cancer. Additional data support the central involvement of CEACAM1 in angiogenesis and metastasis. CEACAM1 also plays a role in the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. For example, CEACAM1 was shown to be an inhibitory receptor for activated T cells contained within the human intestinal epithelium (WO99/52552 and Morales et al. J. Immunol. 1999, 163, 1363-1370). Additional reports have indicated that CEACAM1 engagement either by T Cell Receptor cross-linking with Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or by <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae </i>Opa proteins inhibits T cell activation and proliferation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Melanoma is a malignancy of pigment-producing cells (melanocytes), responsible for 75% of skin cancer-related mortality worldwide, mainly due to extensive metastasis. Metastatic melanoma (MM) responds feebly to most anticancer regimens, and mean overall survival mean for patients with MM is 8.5 months. There is evidence that overexpression of CEACAM1 can be correlated with poor prognosis and is detected in the majority of metastatic melanoma cases. CEACAM1 is rarely expressed by normal melanocytes, but frequently found on melanoma cells. CEACAM1 expression on primary cutaneous melanoma lesions strongly predicts the development of metastatic disease with poor prognosis. Moreover, increased CEACAM1 expression was observed on NK cells derived from some patients with metastatic melanoma compared with healthy donors.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Evidence indicates that CEACAM1 may have an important role in virus infections. For example, Markel at el. (J. Clinical Investigation 2002, 110, 943-953) demonstrated that lymphocytes isolated from the deciduae of CMV-infected patients express the CEACAM1 protein in increased levels. The increased CEACAM1 expression on the decidual lymphocytes might diminish the local immune response and serve as another mechanism developed by the virus to avoid recognition and clearance primarily by activated decidual lymphocytes. Albarran-Somoza et al. (Journal of Histochemistry &#x26; Cytochemistry 2006, 54, 1393), who studied the protein expression pattern of CEACAM1 in cervical cancer and precursor lesions in the context of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, showed that CEACAM1 immunostaining is significantly increased in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) in comparison with low-grade SIL and normal cervical tissues. The authors suggested that CEACAM1 upregulation may be related to integration of HPV DNA in high-grade SIL and that CEACAM1 may be an important biological marker in SIL and cervical cancer progression. Altogether this evidence indicates that CEACAM1 plays an important role in various viral infections.

Furthermore, antibodies according to the present invention are effective against cancer cells, in particular melanoma cells: the antibodies render melanoma cells more susceptible to lymphocytes, inhibit melanoma growth rate in vivo, an effect which is enhanced when the antibody is combined with adoptive T cell transfer in vivo.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0149">It is shown here for the first time that the in vivo anti-melanoma effect of anti-CEACAM1 antibodies according to the invention is a combined direct anti-tumor effect as well as immunomodulatory effect rendering the cells more susceptible to reactive lymphocytes.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0150">An antibody according to the present invention, fragments and derivatives can be used as an effective tool for diagnosis, immunomodulation and cancer treatment.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0151">The antibody inhibits CEACAM1 homophilic interactions, as determined by co-incubation of immune effector cells and target cells expressing CEACAM1 and assaying IL-2 secretion and by the in vitro killing assays.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0152">The antibody of the present invention is shown to enhances CM10 enhances HLA restricted T cell killing and to enhance granzyme B (a serine protease involves in mediation apoptosis of the target cells) secretion from effector NK and T cells in the presence of specific target cells, thus enabling the observed enhanced killing of the target cells by the antibody. It is also inhibits the binding between CEACAM1 to CEACAM5 in a dose-dependent manner therefore can be used to treat malignancies that express high level of CEACAM5 and exploit the CEACAM1-CEACAM5 axis in order to suppress the immune cells.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0153">In addition it is herein shown that, an antibody according to the invention is effective in inhibiting melanoma cells invasion. Furthermore, in vivo administration of an antibody according to the invention, either alone or in combination with reactive lymphocytes was shown effective in inhibiting growth of melanoma tumors. The combination of adoptive human T cell transfer with monoclonal antibody injections exhibited significant synergism and strongly inhibited xenograft growth compared to the isotype control group.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0154">According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an isolated antibody or antibody fragment having the same binding specificity and selectivity to an antibody defined herein comprising an antigen recognition domain having specific CDR segments described above. According to this aspect, isolated antibody or antibody fragment is capable of binding the same epitope determinant of the CEACAM1 protein as does the antibody described above by its specific CDR segments sequences.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0155">The proposed sequence of an epitope to which a monoclonal antibody according to the invention binds is disclosed herein for the same time, together with proposed isolated peptides derived from this epitope which can be used for raising additional monoclonal antibodies.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0156">Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be designed to selectively target tumor cells and elicit a variety of responses once bound. These agents can destruct tumor cells in different ways such as blocking tumor cell proliferation or activating the immune system. Chimeric monoclonal antibodies according to the present invention were designed to specifically bind and neutralize various functions of the CEACAM1 protein and other CEACAM subtype proteins, and to induce the specific death of tumor cells. Without wishing to be bound to any theory, it is suggested that monoclonal antibodies according to the present invention act also via activation of the immune system against cancerous cells.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0157">Both the clinical and biological evidence highlight CEACAM1 as a promising target for the development of targeted-immunotherapy. CEACAM1 is not found on normal melanocytes, but undergoes neo-expression and is widely expressed on the vast majority of metastatic melanoma specimens. It has been previously demonstrated mechanistically that CEACAM1 protects melanoma cells by inhibiting effector functions of NK cells and T cells.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0158">It is herein demonstrated for the first time that CM10 is a chimeric monoclonal antibody which binds with high affinity to human CEACAM1. In-vitro, CM10 efficiently blocked CEACAM1-homophilic interactions in a dose dependent manner and improves CEACAM1 positive melanoma cells killing by T cells and NK cells. Moreover, CM10 significantly inhibited the in-vivo growth of melanoma xenografts when administered systemically along with melanoma-reactive human T lymphocytes (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, TILs). Without wishing to be bound to any theory, this is in line with the suggested mechanism of action; abrogation of immune-protective interactions of the tumor cells with the activated lymphocytes.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0159">Several evidences reported that CEACAM1 is expressed by a wide variety of epithelial cells, including colon, prostate, breast, kidney etc. Extensive examination of CEACAM1 expression profile on normal and malignant tissues by IHC have been performed. The expression analysis showed a strong staining of melanoma cells, as compared to no staining of the vast majority of the tissues tested in a normal human tissue. Nevertheless, some selective staining was observed in restricted sites of several organs. When more quantitative method was used to quantify the number of CM10 mAb molecules bound to malignant and normal primary cells, very low CM10 molecules could be detected in normal cells, which may indicate that CM10 binds mostly to patient's tumor cells. Furthermore it is shown that CM10 has no effect on primary cells proliferation and is completely or almost completely, unable to induce CDC or ADCC indicating the potential safety of the monoclonal antibody in human subjects.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0160">Since CM10 has an immunomodulation activity, possible immune-related side effects, are evaluated. Following PBMC activation, CEACAM1 is upregulated on the activated lymphocytes (Gray-Owen and Blumberg 2006, Nat Rev Immunol 6, 433-46). Ex-vivo human PBMC proliferation assay revealed that CM10 has no effect on na&#xef;ve and activated PBMC proliferative response.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0161">The main advantage of CEACAM1 blockade over abrogation of generalized inhibitory mechanisms is the expected selectivity to the vicinity of the tumor and therefore fewer adverse events compare to other general immune toxicity agents.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0162">As demonstrated in the present invention, CM10 shows encouraging activity and safety profile and is a promising candidate for cancer immunotherapy and can be used as a strategy to selectively enhance the anti-tumor properties of the endogenous immune response in several malignancies, such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0163">Binding to additional CEACAM subtypes increases the therapeutic profile of the antibody, thus it can be used for diagnosis and treatment of other types of malignancies which do not extensively express CEACAM1 but express CEACAM5, for example.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0164">CEACAM5 has been found to be over-expressed in a high percentage of many human tumors, including 90% of gastrointestinal, colorectal (CRC) and pancreatic cancers, 70% of non-small cell lung cancer cells and 50% of breast cancers. It is also over-expressed in thyroid, stomach, ovarian and uterine cancers (Thompson, Grunert et al. 1991, J Clin Lab Anal 5, 344-66). CEACAM5 even serves as a clinical marker for liver metastasis in CRC and post-surgical surveillance of colon cancer (Duffy 2001, Clin Chem 47, 624-30). The evidence that CM10 is capable to bind CEACA5 is very important and can expand the possible indications that can be treated by CM10 from 4-5 types of malignancies to above 10. The anti-CEACAM5 agents that have entered clinical trials include anti-CEACAM5 antibodies conjugated to toxic substances such as radioactive substances for both diagnostic purposes and for the treatment of various malignancies. It seems that even these toxic conjugated forms don't show safety problems, which can indicate that CEACAM5 is a safe target.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0165">The human counterparts of murine IgG subclasses are based on similarities in biological and functional activities. Murine IgG2a and IgG2b and human IgG1 and IgG3 share the ability to fix complement and bind to protein antigens (Hussain et al., 1995, Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology 726-732). Murine IgG1 and human IgG4 are considered to be similar because of their property of binding to mast cells. Human IgG4 is the only human IgG subclass which does not activate complement and the subclasses IgG1 and 3 are the most effective in activating complements. For mouse it is the subclasses IgG2a and IgG2b which are active with IgG1 and possibly IgG3 being inactive (Clark M R., Chem Immunol. 1997; 65:88-110).</p><p id="p-0156" num="0166">Several known monoclonal antibodies which recognize CEACAM1 are of subtype mouse IgG1. As the human equivalent of mouse IgG1 is IgG4 it would be expected to create a chimeric antibody comprising the human IgG4 constant framework. Unexpectedly, according to some embodiments of the present invention chimeric monoclonal antibodies comprise a human IgG1 constant framework.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0167">According to one aspect, the present invention provides a monoclonal antibody which recognizes CEACAM1, or an antibody fragment comprising at least an antigen-binding portion thereof, comprising at least one heavy-chain CDR comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 3, and at least one light-chain CDR comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 6, and analogs and derivatives thereof.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0168">According to some embodiments, analogs and derivatives of the monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof, having at least 90% sequence identity with the sequence of the reference sequence are disclosed.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0169">According to other embodiments analogs and derivatives of the monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof having at least 95% sequence identity with the reference sequence are disclosed.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0170">According to yet other embodiments, analogs and derivatives of the monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof having at least 98% sequence identity with the CDR sequence of the reference antibody are disclosed.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0171">According to one embodiment the antibody or antibody fragment comprises at least two heavy-chain CDRs comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 3, and at least one light-chain CDRs comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 6, and analogs and derivatives thereof having at least 97% sequence identity with the sequence of the monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0172">According to other embodiments the antibody or antibody fragment comprises at least one heavy-chain CDR comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 3, and at least two light-chain CDRs comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 6, and analogs and derivatives thereof having at least 97% sequence identity with the sequence of the monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0173">According to yet other embodiments the antibody or antibody fragment comprises at least two heavy-chain CDRs comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 3, and at least two light-chain CDRs comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 6, and analogs and derivatives thereof having at least 97% sequence identity with the sequence of the monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0174">According to some embodiments the antibody or antibody fragment comprises at least one heavy-chain CDR sequence of at least five amino acids derived from a sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 20 and SEQ ID NO: 21, and at least one light-chain CDR sequence of at least five amino acids derived from a sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 22, SEQ ID NO: 23 and SEQ ID NO: 24, and analogs and derivatives thereof having at least 97% sequence identity with the sequence of the monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0175">According to other embodiments, the antibody binding site of the antibody or fragment thereof consists of three heavy chain CDRs selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 7, 8, 9, 13, 14 and 15 and three light chain CDRs selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, and analogs and derivatives thereof having at least 97% sequence identity with the antibody binding site.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0176">According to yet other embodiments, the antibody binding site consists of the six CDRs of SEQ ID NOs: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0177">According to other embodiments, the antibody binding site consists of the six CDRs of SEQ ID NOs: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0178">The CDR sequences according to the invention were identified using two different algorithm methods: IMGT algorithm (Lefranc et al., 1999, Nucleic Acids Research, 27, 209-212); and KABAT algorithm (Wu T T and Kabat E.

In humans, 11 different CEACAM1 splice variants have been detected so far. Individual CEACAM1 isoforms differ with respect to the number of extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (for example, CEACAM1 with four extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains is known as CEACAM1-4), membrane anchorage and/or the length of their cytoplasmic tail (for example, CEACAM1-4 with a long cytoplasmic tail is known as CEACAM1-4L and CEACAM1-4 with a short cytoplasmic tail is known as CEACAM1-4S). The N-terminal domain of CEACAM1 starts immediately after the signal peptide and its structure is regarded as IgV-type. For example, in CEACAM1 annotation P13688, the N-terminal IgV-type domain is comprised of 108 amino acids, from amino acid 35 to 142. This domain was identified as responsible for the homophilic binding activity (Watt et al., 2001, Blood. 98, 1469-79).

Each light chain has a variable domain (V<sub>L</sub>) at one end and a constant domain (C<sub>L</sub>) at its other end, the light chain variable domain being aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain and the light chain constant domain being aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain (CH1). The variable domains of each pair of light and heavy chains form the antigen-binding site. The domains on the light and heavy chains have the same general structure and each domain comprises four framework regions, whose sequences are relatively conserved, joined by three hypervariable domains known as complementarity determining regions (CDR1-3). These domains contribute specificity and affinity of the antigen-binding site. The isotype of the heavy chain (gamma, alpha, delta, epsilon or mu) determines immunoglobulin class (IgG, IgA, IgD, IgE or IgM, respectively).

In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues.

Such a production of recombinant antibodies is much faster compared to conventional antibody production and they can be generated against an enormous number of antigens. Furthermore, when using the conventional method, many antigens prove to be non-immunogenic or extremely toxic, and therefore cannot be used to generate antibodies in animals. Moreover, affinity maturation (i.e., increasing the affinity and specificity) of recombinant antibodies is very simple and relatively fast. Finally, large numbers of different antibodies against a specific antigen can be generated in one selection procedure. To generate recombinant monoclonal antibodies one can use various methods all based on display libraries to generate a large pool of antibodies with different antigen recognition sites. Such a library can be made in several ways: One can generate a synthetic repertoire by cloning synthetic CDR3 regions in a pool of heavy chain germline genes and thus generating a large antibody repertoire, from which recombinant antibody fragments with various specificities can be selected. One can use the lymphocyte pool of humans as starting material for the construction of an antibody library. It is possible to construct naive repertoires of human IgM antibodies and thus create a human library of large diversity. This method has been widely used successfully to select a large number of antibodies against different antigens.

Preferably the therapeutic agent is a chemotherapeutic agent.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0232">As used herein the term &#x201c;diagnosing&#x201d; refers to determining presence or absence of a pathology, classifying a pathology or a symptom, determining a severity of the pathology, monitoring pathology progression, forecasting an outcome of a pathology and/or prospects of recovery.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Pharmacology</heading><p id="p-0223" num="0233">The present invention also contemplates pharmaceutical formulations for human medical use, which comprise as the active agent at least one antibody which recognizes CEACAM1, for the manufacture of a therapeutic or diagnostic composition for the treatment, diagnosis or prophylaxis of the conditions variously described herein.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0234">In such pharmaceutical and medicament formulations, the active agent is preferably utilized together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s) and optionally any other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be pharmaceutically acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not unduly deleterious to the recipient thereof. The active agent is provided in an amount effective to achieve the desired pharmacological effect, as described above, and in a quantity appropriate to achieve the desired daily dose.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0235">Typically, the molecules of the present invention comprising the antigen binding portion of an antibody or comprising another polypeptide including a peptidomimetic will be suspended in a sterile saline solution for therapeutic uses. The pharmaceutical compositions may alternatively be formulated to control release of active ingredient (molecule comprising the antigen binding portion of an antibody) or to prolong its presence in a patient's system. Numerous suitable drug delivery systems are known and include, e.g., implantable drug release systems, hydrogels, hydroxymethylcellulose, microcapsules, liposomes, microemulsions, microspheres, and the like. Controlled release preparations can be prepared through the use of polymers to complex or adsorb the molecule according to the present invention. For example, biocompatible polymers include matrices of poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) and matrices of a polyanhydride copolymer of a stearic acid dimer and sebaric acid. The rate of release of the molecule according to the present invention, i.e., of an antibody or antibody fragment, from such a matrix depends upon the molecular weight of the molecule, the amount of the molecule within the matrix, and the size of dispersed particles.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0236">The pharmaceutical composition of this invention may be administered by any suitable means, such as orally, topically, intranasally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intravenously, intra-arterially, intraarticulary, intralesionally or parenterally. Ordinarily, intravenous (i.v.), intraarticular, topical or parenteral administration will be preferred.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0237">It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the therapeutically effective amount of the molecule according to the present invention will depend, inter alia upon the administration schedule, the unit dose of molecule administered, whether the molecule is administered in combination with other therapeutic agents, the immune status and health of the patient, the therapeutic activity of the molecule administered and the judgment of the treating physician. As used herein, a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; refers to the amount of a molecule required to alleviate one or more symptoms associated with a disorder being treated over a period of time.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0238">Although an appropriate dosage of a molecule of the invention varies depending on the administration route, type of molecule (polypeptide, polynucleotide, organic molecule etc.) age, body weight, sex, or conditions of the patient, and should be determined by the physician in the end, in the case of oral administration, the daily dosage can generally be between about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg, preferably about 0.01 mg to about 50 mg, more preferably about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg, per kg body weight.

Three human primary cells of tissues, which were found to be positive for anti-CEACAM1 binding, were purchased from ATCC. HUVEC cells to represent the positive staining found in endothelial cells; primary prostate epithelial cells, since the apical surface of prostate glands showed positive staining, and primary renal proximal tubule epithelial cells since the inner surface of tubules stained positive.

Furthermore, high numbers of CM10 antibodies were bound to the NK cells (&#x2dc;20000) which correlates with published data showing high CEACAM1 expression on activated lymphocytes.

CEACAM1 is absence on normal melanocytes but undergoes neo-expression and is widely expressed on the vast majority of metastatic melanoma specimens (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), in other normal organ there is restricted expression of CEACAM1 in specific cells within several tissues. A quantitative analysis, measuring the number of CM10 molecules that are bound to cells, revealed a very low numbers of bound-CM10 on normal human primary cell (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). These results imply that the majority of CM10 molecule injected to patients will mainly target cancer cells and not normal tissues due to expression differences. Furthermore, CM10 has no effect on cell proliferation, CDC activity, and negligible or low ADCC activity which suggests that the binding of CM10 to non-target cells, would not result in unwanted cell outcome.</p><heading id="h-0036" level="2">The Effect of CM10 on the Immune System</heading><p id="p-0284" num="0291">CM10 is an immunostimulatory antibody that blocks the interaction between two CEACAM1 molecules and by doing so mediates stimulation of lymphocytes against malignant cells. It is important to verify that the antibody will not cause unleashed stimulation of the immune system which can cause severe adverse events. In normal lymphocytes there is a neglect expression of CEACAM1 on the cell membrane, only following cell activation CEACAM1 is mobilized to the membrane, where it rapidly and strongly up-regulated on activated lymphocytes (Gray-Owen and Blumberg 2006, Nat Rev Immunol 6, 433-46). As demonstrated above, no cross reactivity to normal lymphatic tissues (Spleen, Thymus, Bone Marrow) or to lymphocytes was observed; nevertheless various in-vitro and ex-vivo immuno-toxicity analyses were performed to help in predicting potential side effects.</p><heading id="h-0037" level="2">The Effect of CM10 on Human Lymphocytes Proliferation</heading><p id="p-0285" num="0292">One of the most common and acceptable ways to evaluate safety of immunomodulatory antibodies in-vitro is by examine its effects on proliferation and cytokine secretion of normal human PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells). Human PBMC from 3 unrelated donors were isolated and incubated with CM10 using 3 different concentrations (2 &#x3bc;g/ml, 20 &#x3bc;g/ml or 200 &#x3bc;g/ml) or with a control mAb IgG1K (200 &#x3bc;g/ml) for 60 minutes and with eight replicate wells. PHA (1 &#x3bc;g/ml) was added to 4 of the assay replicate wells and cells were incubated for 96 hours. 3H-Thymidine incorporation used to assay cell proliferation. Mock stimulated cells and PHA only stimulated cells used as assay's negative and positive controls respectively. The proliferation was assessed in resting lymphocytes as well as in activated lymphocytes (PHA treated). Mock stimulated cells and PHA only stimulated cells used as assay's negative and positive controls respectively. The results (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) clearly show that CM10 has no effect on the proliferation of na&#xef;ve or activated human lymphocytes. In addition to the PBMC proliferation study, the effect of CM10 on cytokine secretion from human PBMC is assessed. Cytokine secretion studies define the immunomodulatory effect of CM10 and assist in predicting potential side effects.</p><heading id="h-0038" level="1">Example 8.

The CEACAM proteins have been implicated in various adhesion mediated effects that govern the growth and differentiation of normal and cancerous cells (Gray-Owen and Blumberg 2006, Nat Rev Immunol 6, 433-46). The closely related proteins in the family share a high amino acid similarity that varies from 45% up to 90% similarity between certain members.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0294">A standard FACS protocol was used with CM10 conjugated to a Biotin molecule and Strep-Avidin APC as secondary agent. 721.221 cells expressing CEACAM 1,5,6,8 or HEK 293 T transient expressing CEACAM 3, 4, were stained with biotinylated CM10 (1 &#x3bc;g/ml) and Strep-Avidin APC as secondary agent. Empty histograms represent mAb staining while red histograms represent background staining. At least 10000 cells were used to analyze CM10 binding in each histogram. FAB was calculated by dividing the MFI of the stained cells in the MFI of the background staining. The results demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, clearly indicate that CM10 bind strongly to cells expressing CEACAM1.

The over-expression of CEACAM1 has been identified in a few malignancies among them melanoma, NSCLC, Thyroid cancer and gastric cancer. The evidence indicates that over-expression of CEACAM1 can be correlated with poor prognosis in melanoma and NSCLC patients. CEACAM5 has been found to be over-expressed in a high percentage of many human tumors, including 90% of gastrointestinal, colorectal (CRC) and pancreatic cancers, 70% of non-small cell lung cancer cells and 50% of breast cancers. It is also over-expressed in thyroid, stomach, ovarian and uterine cancers (Thompson, Grunert et al. 1991, J Clin Lab Anal 5, 344-66). CEACAM5 even serves as a clinical marker for liver metastasis in CRC and post-surgical surveillance of colon cancer (Duffy 2001, Clin Chem 47, 624-30). The evidence that CM10 is capable to bind CEACA5 is very important and can expand the possible indications that can be treated by CM10 from 4-5 types of malignancies to above 10. The anti-CEACAM5 agents that have entered clinical trials include anti-CEACAM5 antibodies conjugated to toxic substances such as radioactive substances for both diagnostic purposes and for the treatment of various malignancies. It seems that even these toxic conjugated forms don't show safety problems, which can indicate that CEACAM5 is a safe target (Liersch, et al. 2005, J Clin Oncol 23(27), 6763-70; Ychou, et al. 2008, Clin Cancer Res 14(11), 3487-93). On the other hand, none of these agents target the immunological regulation of tumors, which can be targeted by an antibody which can bind both CEACAM1 and CEACAM5, such as CM10.</p><heading id="h-0040" level="1">Example 9: Epitope Mapping of CM10</heading><p id="p-0289" num="0296">To reconstruct discontinuous epitopes of the target molecule, a library of structured peptides was synthesized.

The side-chains of multiple cysteines in the peptides are coupled to one or two CLIPS templates. For example, a 0.5 mM solution of the T2 CLIPS template 1,3-bis (bromomethyl) benzene is dissolved in ammonium bicarbonate (20 mM, pH 7.9)/acetonitrile (1:1(v/v). This solution is added onto the peptide arrays. The CLIPS template will bind to side-chains of two cysteines as present in the solid-phase bound peptides of the peptide-arrays (455 wells plate with 3 &#x3bc;l wells). The peptide arrays are gently shaken in the solution for 30 to 60 minutes while completely covered in solution. Finally, the peptide arrays are washed extensively with excess of H<sub>2</sub>O and sonicated in disrupt-buffer containing 1 percent SDS/0.1 percent beta-mercaptoethanol in PBS (pH 7.2) at 70&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes, followed by sonication in H<sub>2</sub>O for another 45 minutes.

PD markers are often proximal in a molecular pathway to the drug target and are used to measure the effect of a drug regardless of therapeutic effect. Granzyme B is a serine protease that is released through cytoplasmic granules of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and NK cells upon recognition of specific targets. This in turn mediates the apoptosis of the target cells.

In this model, human tumor cells are transplanted under the skin into immunocompromised mice that do not reject human cells. Depending upon the number of cells injected and the cells' growth rate, the tumor develops over several weeks, and the response to appropriate therapeutic regimes can be studied in vivo. The advantage of a model that involves treatment in early stages of tumor formation is the opportunity to examine the agent's influence in a setting that can be more similar to metastasis spread in patients and to identify the effect of the treatment on initial tumor implantation.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0314">The immunomodulatory activity of CM10 in vivo was therefore examined in SCID-NOD mice engrafted with human melanoma cells under prophylactic treatment regime.

Thus, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid sequence introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as &#x201c;import&#x201d; residues, which are typically taken from an &#x201c;import&#x201d; variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525, 1986; Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327, 1988; Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536, 1988), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0322">The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called &#x201c;best-fit&#x201d; method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework (FR) for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., J. Immunol., 151:2296, 1993; Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol., 196:901, 1987). Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285, 1992; Presta et al., J. Immunol., 151:2623, 1993).</p><p id="p-0317" num="0323">It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0324">Alternatively, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge (e.g., Jakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:2551, 1993; Jakobovits et al., Nature, 362:255-258, 1993; Bruggermann et al., Year in Immuno., 7:33, 1993; and Duchosal et al. Nature 355:258, 1992. Human antibodies can also be derived from phage-display libraries (Hoogenboom et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227:381, 1991; Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597, 1991; Vaughan et al. Nature Biotech 14:309, 1996).</p><heading id="h-0049" level="1">Example 12. Antibody Fragments</heading><p id="p-0319" num="0325">Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (e.g., Morimoto et al., Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24:107-117, 1992 and Brennan et al., Science, 229:81, 1985). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. For example, the antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab&#x2032;-SH fragments can be directly recovered from <i>E. coli </i>and chemically coupled to form F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments (Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167, 1992). According to another approach, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner.
