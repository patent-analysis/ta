This text file is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are many instances where the efficacy of a therapeutic protein is limited by an unwanted immune reaction to the therapeutic protein.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Several mouse monoclonal antibodies have shown promise as therapies in a number of human disease settings but in certain cases have failed due to the induction of significant degrees of a human anti-murine antibody (HAMA) response (Schroff, R. W. et al. (1985) <i>Cancer Res. </i>45: 879-885; Shawler, D. L. et al. (1985) <i>J. Immunol. </i>135: 1530-1535). For monoclonal antibodies, a number of techniques have been developed in attempt to reduce the HAMA response (WOA8909622; EPA0239400; EPA0438310; WOA9106667; EPA0699755). These recombinant DNA approaches have generally reduced the mouse genetic information in the final antibody construct whilst increasing the human genetic information in the final construct to result in antibody molecules which are generally termed &#x201c;humanised&#x201d; antibodies.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Humanised antibodies, for the most part, are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which hypervariable region residues of the recipient are replaced by hypervariable region residues from a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or primate, and this process is sometimes termed &#x201c;CDR grafting&#x201d;. Generally additional Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues and in some instances other substitutions are made to further restore the antibody function. Typically humanised antibodies are reconstituted into whole antibody molecules comprising two variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanised antibody will also generally comprise at least a portion of a human derived immunoglobulin constant region (Fc) (Jones et al. (1986), <i>Nature </i>321: 522-525; Reichmann et al. (1988), <i>Nature </i>332: 323-329). Notwithstanding, humanised antibodies have, in several cases, still elicited an immune response in patients (Issacs J. D. (1990) <i>Sem. Immunol. </i>2: 449, 456; Rebello, P. R. et al. (1999) <i>Transplantation </i>68: 1417-1420).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Key to the induction of an immune response is the presence within the protein of peptides that can stimulate the activity of T-cells via presentation on MHC Class II molecules, so-called &#x201c;T-cell epitopes&#x201d;. Such T-cell epitopes are commonly defined as any amino acid residue sequence with the ability to bind to MHC Class II molecules. Implicitly, a &#x201c;T-cell epitope&#x201d; means an epitope which when bound to MHC molecules can be recognized by a T-cell receptor (TCR), and which can, at least in principle, cause the activation of these T-cells by engaging a TCR to promote a T-cell response.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">MHC Class II molecules are a group of highly polymorphic proteins which play a central role in helper T-cell selection and activation. The human leukocyte antigen group DR (HLA-DR) are the predominant isotype of this group of proteins and isotypes HLA-DQ and HLA-DP perform similar functions. In the human population, individuals bear two to four DR alleles, two DQ and two DP alleles. The structure of a number of DR molecules has been solved and these appear as an open-ended peptide binding groove with a number of hydrophobic pockets which engage hydrophobic residues (pocket residues) of the peptide (Brown et al. <i>Nature </i>(1993) 364: 33; Stern et al. <i>Nature </i>(1994) 368: 215). Polymorphism identifying the different allotypes of Class II molecule contributes to a wide diversity of different binding surfaces for peptides within the peptide binding grove and at the population level ensures maximal flexibility with regard to the ability to recognize foreign proteins and mount an immune response to pathogenic organisms.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An immune response to a therapeutic protein proceeds via the MHC Class II peptide presentation pathway. Here exogenous proteins are engulfed and processed for presentation in association with MHC Class II molecules of the DR, DQ or DP type. MHC Class II molecules are expressed by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages and dendritic cells amongst others. Engagement of a MHC Class II peptide complex by a cognate T-cell receptor on the surface of the T-cell, together with the cross-binding of certain other co-receptors such as the CD4 molecule, can induce an activated state within the T-cell. Activation leads to the release of cytokines further activating other lymphocytes such as B cells to produce antibodies or activating T killer cells as a full cellular immune response.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">T-cell epitope identification is the first step to epitope elimination. Identified epitopes may be eliminated by judicious amino acid substitution or other modification strategies. Such an approach is recognized in WO98/52976 and WO00/34317 where in the latter case computational threading techniques are described as a means to identify polypeptide sequences with the potential to bind a sub-set of human MHC Class II DR allotypes and the predicted T-cell epitopes are removed by amino acid substitution within the protein of interest.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It would be desirable to identify and to remove, or at least to reduce, T-cell epitopes from a given, in principle therapeutically valuable, but originally immunogenic peptide, polypeptide or protein. One of these therapeutically valuable molecules is a monoclonal antibody with binding specificity for the human B-cell antigen CD20. The preferred monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are modified forms of the antibody 2B8 and Leu16. Antibody 2B8 is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,137, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Antibody Leu16 is described in Wu et al. <i>Protein Engineering </i>(2001) 14:1025-1033, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">CD20 is a non-glycosylated phosphoprotein of 35,000 Daltons, typically designated as the human B lymphocyte restricted differentiation antigen Bp35B. The protein is a highly cell specific surface molecule expressed on pre-B and mature B-cells including greater than 90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Monoclonal antibodies and radioimmunoconjugates targeting CD20 have emerged as new treatments for NHL. The most significant example includes the parental antibody of the present invention, namely monoclonal antibody 2B8 (Reff, M. E. et al. (1994) <i>Blood </i>83: 435-445). The variable region domains of 2B8 have been cloned and combined with human constant region domains to produce a chimeric antibody designated C2B8 which is marketed as RITUXAN&#x2122; in the U.S.A. or MABTHERA&#xae; (rituximab) in Europe. C2B8 is recognized as a valuable therapeutic agent for the treatment of NHL and other B-cell diseases (Maloney, D. G. et al. (1997) <i>J. Clin. Oncol. </i>15: 3266-3274; Maloney, D. G. et al. (1997) <i>Blood </i>90: 2188-2195).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An additional example of an anti-CD20 therapeutic is provided by the antibody B1, described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,090,365, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This antibody has similarly achieved registration for use as a NHL therapeutic although in this case the molecule (BEXXAR&#x2122;) is a <sup>131</sup>I radioimmunoconjugate. The native B1 (non-conjugated) antibody has utility in ex vivo purging regimens for autologous bone marrow transplantation therapies for lymphoma and refractory leukaemia (Freedman, A. S. et al. (1990), <i>J. Clin. Oncol. </i>8: 784).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Despite the success of antibodies such as C2B8 (rituximab) and BEXXAR&#x2122; there is a continued need for anti-CD20 analogues with enhanced properties. There is a particular need for enhancement of the in vivo characteristics when administered to the human subject. In this regard, it is highly desired to provide anti-CD20 antibodies with reduced or absent potential to induce an immune response in the human subject. Such proteins would display an increased circulation time within the human subject and would be of particular benefit in chronic use settings such as is the case for the therapeutic use of anti-CD20 molecules.

CD20-binding polypeptide compositions include one or more polypeptide chains having a binding affinity for the CD20 antigen, preferably human CD20 antigen. CD20-binding polypeptide compositions of the invention include one or more CD20-binding polypeptide chains having a reduced number of human T cell epitopes as compared to the native heavy chain variable region (Vh) and/or the native light chain variable region (Vk) of murine monoclonal antibodies 2B8 and Leu16, per se, as well as these polypeptides in a suitable carrier vehicle, which can be a liquid or a solid.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Reference to &#x201c;substantially non-immunogenic&#x201d; or &#x201c;reduced immunogenic potential,&#x201d; as used herein and in the appended claims, means reduced immunogenicity compared to a counterpart or &#x201c;parent&#x201d; antibody, i.e. a non-modified murine or chimeric monoclonal antibody such as 2B8 or Leu16. The term &#x201c;immunogenicity&#x201d; means an ability to provoke, induce or otherwise facilitate a humoral and or T-cell mediated response in a host animal and in particular where the &#x201c;host animal&#x201d; is a human.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The term &#x201c;antibody molecule&#x201d; refers to a polypeptide of the immunoglobulin family, including a whole antibody, that is capable of combining, interacting or otherwise associating with an antigen. The term &#x201c;antigen&#x201d; is used herein to refer to a substance that is capable of interacting with the antibody molecule and in the context of the present invention is meant to be CD20. The CD20 of the present invention is human CD20 or any CD20 representing an antigen for antibody 2B8. The CD20 may be a soluble CD20 derivative or membrane associated CD20.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The term &#x201c;immunoglobulin&#x201d; is used herein to refer to a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the &#x3ba;, &#x3bb;, &#x3b1;, &#x3b3; (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), &#x3c3;, &#x3b5;, and &#x3bc; constant region genes and in nature multiple immunoglobulin variable region genes. One natural form of immunoglobulin is a tetramer comprising two identical pairs in which each pair has one light chain and one heavy chain. In each pair the heavy and light chain variable regions together provide the binding surface capable of interacting with the antigen. The term Vh is used herein to refer to the heavy chain variable region, and the term Vk is used herein to refer to the light chain variable region and in this instance in common with numerous monoclonal antibodies the light chain is a &#x201c;kappa&#x201d; (k) type chain.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The V-region includes amino acid residues from a &#x201c;complementarity determining region&#x201d; or &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; (i.e. at about amino acid residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and at about amino acid residues 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain as defined by Kabat et al. (Kabat et al. <i>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, </i>5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). Alternative definitions of the CDRs are also recognized in the art for example according to the scheme of Chothia (Chothia and Lesk (1987) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>196: 901-917) in which case the CDRs are found at about amino acid residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain, and at about amino acid residues 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain. &#x201c;Framework&#x201d; or &#x201c;FR&#x201d; residues are those V-region residues other than the CDR residues as herein defined.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As used herein, Vh includes a polypeptide that is about 110 to 125 amino acid residues in length, the sequence of which corresponds to any of the specified Vh chains herein which in combination with a Vk are capable of binding human CD20. Similarly, Vk includes a polypeptide that is about 95-130 amino acid residues in length, the sequence of which corresponds to any of the specified Vk chains herein which in combination with a Vh are capable of binding human CD20. Full-length immunoglobulin heavy chains are about 50 kDa molecular weight and are encoded by a Vh gene at the N-terminus and one of the constant region genes (e.g. &#x3b3;) at the C-terminus. Similarly, full-length light chains are about 25 kDa molecular weight and are encoded by a V-region gene at the N-terminus and a &#x3ba; or &#x3b3; constant region gene at the C-terminus.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition to a whole antibody (a tetramer), immunoglobulins may exist in a number of other forms produced by application of recombinant DNA techniques or protein biochemistry. These forms include for example Fv, Fab, Fab&#x2032; and F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>molecules and could all contain any of the Vh or Vk sequences of the present invention. An additional example is a &#x201c;bi-specific&#x201d; antibody, that is comprising a Vh/Vk combination of the present invention in combination with a second Vh/Vk combination with a different antigen specificity.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The term &#x201c;T-cell epitope,&#x201d; as used herein and in the appended claims, means an amino acid sequence which is able to bind MHC Class II, able to stimulate T-cells and/or also to bind (without necessarily measurably activating) T-cells in complex with MHC Class II.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The term &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; as used herein and in the appended claims, is a compound that includes two or more amino acid residues. The amino acid residues are linked together by a peptide bond (defined herein below). There are 20 different common, naturally occurring amino acids involved in the biological production of peptides, and any number of them may be linked in any order to form a peptide chain or ring. The naturally occurring amino acids employed in the biological production of peptides all have the L-configuration. Synthetic peptides can also be prepared employing conventional synthetic methods, utilizing L-amino acids as well as D-amino acids, or various combinations of amino acids of the two different configurations. Some peptides contain only a few amino acid residues. Short peptides, e.g., having less than ten amino acid residues, are sometimes referred to as &#x201c;oligopeptides.&#x201d; Other peptides contain a large number of amino acid residues, e.g. up to 100 or more, and are referred to as &#x201c;polypeptides.&#x201d; By convention, a &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; may be considered as any peptide chain containing three or more amino acid residues, whereas an &#x201c;oligopeptide&#x201d; is usually considered as a particular type of &#x201c;short&#x201d; polypeptide. Thus, as used herein, it is understood that any reference to a &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; herein also includes an oligopeptide. Further, any reference to a &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; includes polypeptides, oligopeptides, and proteins. Each different arrangement of amino acid residues forms different polypeptides or proteins.

The amino acid residue sequences of the modified Vh and Vk polypeptides were designed based on an analysis of the V-region amino acid residue sequences of the mouse monoclonal antibodies 2B8 and Leu16. These antibodies are disclosed fully in respect of their useful in vitro and in vivo properties in U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,137; U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,456;U.S. Pat. No. 6,399,061; U.S. Pat. No. 6,455,043 and foreign equivalents, and in Wu et al. (<i>Protein Enginering </i>(2001) 14:1025-1033) and references cited therein.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Sequence analysis was conducted to identify portions of the Vh and Vk peptides that can bind to a MHC Class II ligand and therefore, can function as a T-cell epitope in man. Identification of the positions of potential MHC Class II epitopes within a given peptide sequence is a first step of the engineering process. Epitope identification was conducted computationally, following the scheme outlined in detail in WO 02/069232, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Substitution of particular amino acid residues within a V-region heavy chain (Vh) or light chain (Vk) of the parental antibody results in a modified Vh or Vk polypeptide with a reduced number of MHC Class II ligands and accordingly, a reduced propensity for the polypeptide to act as a T-cell epitope in a human. At the same time, the amino acid residue substitutions provide polypeptides that retain structural and functional properties of the parental antibody Vh and Vk regions, including stable expression within a host cell and ability for the polypeptide to bind to human CD20 antigen, and especially the ability to bind to human B-cells in vitro.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The Vh and Vk amino acid residue sequences of 2B8 and Leu16, as well as the anti-CD20 antibody B1, are quite similar, even though they are of independent origin. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is notable that the sequence CEPA<u style="single">NPS</u>EKNSPSTQYC (SEQ ID NO: 29) in human CD20, which is part of the short extracellular peptide of CD20, and which is flanked by cysteines that are likely to form a disulfide bond, corresponds to the sequence CEPS<u style="single">NSS</u>EKNSPSTQYC (SEQ ID NO: 38) in mouse CD20. The mouse NSS sequence (underlined in SEQ ID NO: 38, above) is likely to be an N-linked glycosylation site, while the corresponding NPS sequence (underlined in SEQ ID NO: 29, above) in humans is not likely to be an N-linked glycosylation site. This difference between the mouse and human CD20 sequences indicates the location of a human T cell epitope. Accordingly, it is likely that all of the mouse antibodies generated against human CD20 may be used to recognize a very narrowly defined epitope.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The present invention provides a set of reduced-immunogenicity consensus V-region sequences that are useful for recognition of human CD20. For example, a modified heavy chain variable region including the sequence segment VSCKASGYT (SEQ ID NO: 16) is a less immunogenic polypeptide than a polypeptide containing the corresponding sequence segment MSCKASGYT (SEQ ID NO: 30), from the native 2B8 and Leu16 antibodies. Similarly, modified heavy chain variable regions that include one or more of the modified sequences YNQKFKGKT (SEQ ID NO: 18), FKGKTTLTA (SEQ ID NO: 19), and YMELSSLRS (SEQ ID NO: 20) are less immunogenic than native heavy chain variable regions containing the corresponding sequences, YNQKFKGKA (SEQ ID NO: 31), FKGKATLTA (SEQ ID NO: 32), and YMQLSSLRS (SEQ ID NO: 33), which are found in the parental 2B8 and Leu16 antibodies.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">A modified light chain variable region including the sequence IITASPGEKV (SEQ ID NO: 23) is less immunogenic than a light chain variable region containing the corresponding sequence ILSASPGEKV (SEQ ID NO: 34), from the parental 2B8 and Leu16 antibodies. Similarly, modified light chain variable regions including one or more of the sequences LASGVPSRF (SEQ ID NO: 26), FSGSGSGTT (SEQ ID NO: 27), and YSMTISSLE (SEQ ID NO: 28) are less immunogenic than light chain variable regions including the corresponding sequences, LASGVPVARF (SEQ ID NO: 35), FSGSGSGTS (SEQ ID NO: 36), and YSLTISRVE (SEQ ID NO: 37), which are found in the parental 2B8 and Leu16 antibodies.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">For the elimination of T-cell epitopes, amino acid substitutions are made at appropriate points within the peptide sequence predicted to achieve substantial reduction or elimination of the activity of the T-cell epitope. In practice an appropriate point will preferably equate to an amino acid residue binding within one of the pockets provided within the MHC Class II binding groove.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is most preferred to alter binding within the first pocket of the cleft at the so-called P1 or &#x201c;P1 anchor&#x201d; position of the peptide. The quality of binding interaction between the P1 anchor residue of the peptide and the first pocket of the MHC Class II binding groove is recognized as being a major determinant of overall binding affinity for the whole peptide. An appropriate substitution at this position of the peptide is for a residue less readily accommodated within the pocket, for example, substitution to a more hydrophilic residue. Amino acid residues in the peptide at positions equating to binding within other pocket regions within the MHC binding cleft are also considered and fall under the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">A single amino acid substitution within a given potential T cell epitope is the most preferred route by which the epitope may be eliminated. Combinations of substitution within a single epitope may be contemplated, and for example, can be particularly appropriate where individually defined epitopes are in overlap with each other. Moreover, amino acid substitutions either singly within a given epitope, or in combination within a single epitope, may be made at positions not equating to the &#x201c;pocket residues&#x201d; with respect to the MHC Class II binding groove, but at any point within the peptide sequence. All such substitutions fall within the scope of the present.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A significant feature of the CD20-binding polypeptide compositions of the invention, such as modified anti-CD20 antibody molecules, is that they retain the functional activities of the non-modified parental antibody. It is therefore particularly desired to produce modified antibodies, modified antibody molecules, and other CD20-binding polypeptide compositions in which substantially all of the beneficial technical features associated with the therapeutic efficacy of the parental non-modified antibody are exhibited. This is pertinent to the contemplated utility of the invention, namely to provide a composition with therapeutic efficacy in a number of important diseases in man including especially B-cell lymphoma and other B-cell mediated pathologies. Such therapeutic agents are preferred embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Accordingly, the CD20-binding polypeptide compositions of the present invention exhibit an affinity for its target CD20 antigen that is similar to the affinity exhibited by the parental antibody. The polypeptide compositions therefore recognize CD20 positive human B-cells. The therapeutic efficacy of a parental antibody such as 2B8 and Leu16 is considered to be mediated by the ability of the antibody to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytoxicity (ADCC). A significant feature of this activity is the ability of the antibody constant region (i.e. the Fc domain) to bind human serum complement component C1q. ADCC and C1q binding are both mediated by the constant region domain of whole antibody molecule. The present invention contemplates, in one aspect, production of whole antibody molecules comprising a human Fc region that is compatible with ADCC induction. Such constant regions are most preferably IgG1 heavy chains in combination with human kappa light (e.g. Km3) chains.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The present invention also provides antibody fragments of reduced immunogenicity, including for example, Fv, Fab, Fab&#x2032; and F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments. Such fragments may be prepared by standard methods (see, for example; Coligan et al. (<i>Current Protocols in Immunology</i>, John Wiley &#x26; Sons 1991-1997). The present invention also provides various recombinant forms of antibody molecules. Such species include stabilized Fv fragments having single chain Fv forms (e.g. scFv) and comprising a peptide linker joining the Vh and Vk domains, as well as an Fv fragments stabilized by inter-chain disulfide linkage (dsFv), and which contain additional cysteine residues engineered to facilitate the conjoining of the Vh and Vk domains. Other compositions include species referred to as &#x201c;minibodies&#x201d;; and single variable domain &#x201c;dAbs&#x201d;, as well as materials that incorporate structures that increase the valency of the modified antibody V-region domain, i.e. materials having multiple antigen binding sites, for example, by including dimerization domains (e.g. &#x201c;leucine zippers&#x201d;) or other chemical modifications.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In yet another aspect, the invention relates to fusion proteins in which modified anti-CD20 V-regions are coupled to a non-immunoglobulin fusion partner protein, such as an anticancer protein. Examples of such proteins include toxins, such as <i>Pseudomonas </i>exotoxin; enzymes, such as bacterial proteases for antibody-dependent prodrug therapy (&#x201c;ADEPT&#x201d;), or most preferably, cytokines Particularly useful cytokines are wild-type and mutant versions of IL-2, IL-12, fused forms of IL-2 and IL-12, and other interleukins, interferons, and tumor necrosis factors. Gillies and co-workers (U.S. Pat. No. 5,150,650, WO98/25978, WO01/10912, WO02/72605, WO03/48334), Epstein (WO 03/15697), and Halin et al. (<i>Cancer Res</i>. (2003) 63:3202-10, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, have described a number of configurations of anti-cancer antibody V-regions and cytokines. The immunoglobulin constant regions of fusion proteins comprising the V-regions of the present invention may be further modified by mutations, such as mutations affecting complement fixation, mutations affecting Fc receptor binding, mutations affecting FcRn binding, mutations affecting the serum half-life of the fusion protein and mutations removing potential T cell epitopes from the junction region of an Ig heavy chain fusion protein. Examples of such mutations are described in WO09943713, WO01/58957, WO02/079232, and WO02/079415, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">For Ig fusion proteins it has been observed that alteration of amino acid residues near the junction of the Ig heavy chain constant region and the non-Ig fusion partner protein can dramatically increase the serum half-life of the Ig fusion protein (PCT publication WO 01/58957, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference). Accordingly, the junction region of an anti-CD20 Ig fusion protein of the present invention can contain alterations that, relative to the naturally-occurring sequences of an immunoglobulin heavy chain and the fusion partner protein (such as IL-2), preferably lie within about 10 amino acid residues of the junction point. These amino acid residue changes can increase hydrophobicity by, for example, changing the C-terminal lysine of the Ig heavy chain constant region to a hydrophobic amino acid residue such as alanine or leucine.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In other embodiments, the Ig heavy chain portion of the Ig fusion protein contains amino acid residue alterations of the Leu-Ser-Leu-Ser (SEQ ID NO: 46) segment near the C-terminus of the immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region. The amino acid residue substitutions of the Leu-Ser-Leu-Ser (SEQ ID NO: 46) segment eliminate potential junctional T-cell epitopes. In one particular embodiment, the Leu-Ser-Leu-Ser (SEQ ID NO: 46) amino acid residue sequence near the C-terminus of the Ig heavy chain portion is replaced with an Ala-Thr-Ala-Thr (SEQ ID NO: 47) amino acid residue sequence. In other embodiments, the amino acid residues within the Leu-Ser-Leu-Ser (SEQ ID NO: 46) segment are replaced with other amino acid residues such as glycine or proline. Detailed methods of generating amino acid substitutions of the Leu-Ser-Leu-Ser (SEQ ID NO: 46) segment near the C-terminus of an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, or other immunoglobulin class molecule have been described in U.S. patent application Ser.

Administration by inhalation, orally, or by suppositories is also possible, as are other routes of administration. Administration is preferably in a four-week cycle of three times per week, followed by no treatment for the next three weeks. Treatments can be more or less frequent depending on the pharmacokinetic behavior of the fusion protein in a given individual. The preferred dosage for an adult of about 70 kilograms is in the range of about 1 to about 100 milligrams per dose, with a preferred range of about 4 to about 20 milligrams per dose.

This schedule was chosen due to the much longer circulating half-life of rituximab (several days) compared to the immunocytokines (about 8 hours). Under these conditions, rituximab (25 mg/kg&#xd7;3) extended the 50% survival of tumor bearing mice from 39 to 56 days, relative to the PBS control (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The low dose chimeric and Leu16VhY/VkZ-IL2 groups (0.25 mg/kg&#xd7;5) had similar survival curves (50% survival at 64 days) as the high-dose rituximab. The groups treated with the higher doses of the immunocytokines (1 mg/kg&#xd7;5) showed a dramatic increase in survival with no mouse deaths in the Leu16VhY/VkZ-IL2 group at the termination of the experiment (Day 110) and only 1 of 8 mice dead in the chLeu16-IL2 group. Thus, the epitope-depleted V-regions of the Leu16 antibody were as effective as those of the murine Leu16 antibody, in the context of an IL-2 based immunocytokine, for the treatment of disseminated lymphoma in SCID mice.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the anti-CD20 binding activity of CD20-binding polypeptide compositions and immunocytokines (ICs). Human Daudi lymphoma cells were incubated with varying concentrations of polypeptide compositions and ICs and relative binding to the cells was assessed by flow cytometry, as described in Example 2. Panel A shows the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI, Y axis), which increases as a function of polypeptide concentration (X axis). Panel B shows the fluorescence intensity measured on a Daudi cell sample with no primary antibody present (leftmost peak, labeled control); an antibody-IL2 fusion directed against EGF receptor (425-IL2), which is not expressed on Daudi cells (left-central peak); and Leu16VhY/VkZ-IL2 (anti-CD20 PC2) (right-most peak, labeled DILeu16-IL2).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the same experiment, the contribution of antibody effector function on anti-tumor activity was also tested using the enzymatically de-glycosylated Leu16VhY/VkZ-IL2 (anti-CD20 PC3), which was shown above to have lost ADCC activity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, Panel B). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a significant portion of the anti-tumor activity was preserved despite the loss of ADCC activity. At later time points, a marked difference between the intact and de-glycosylated forms was observed in the higher dose groups. Therefore, while ADCC appears to play a role in this model, a good deal of the anti-tumor activity in this model can be attributed to targeted delivery of IL-2 to the tumor alone.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">To address the importance of actual binding of an epitope-depleted immunocytokine to a target cell, as opposed to an effect of simply extending the serum half-life of IL-2, a control IL-2 immunocytokine targeting EGFR (Cruz et al. <i>J. Biotechnol</i>. (2002) 26; 96:169-183), which is expressed at only very low levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, Panel B) on this cell line, was tested. It was found that even the higher dose (1 mg/kg) given 5 consecutive days had far less anti-tumor activity in this model than the same dose of the immunocytokines targeting CD20 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The EGFR-targeted immunocytokine also had significantly less activity than the same dose of Leu16VhY/VkZ-IL2 given only twice, three days apart (Days 7 and 10), or at a four-fold lower dose given over 5 days. These results demonstrate the importance of specific tumor cell targeting for anti-tumor activity.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="1">Example 7</heading><heading id="h-0022" level="1">Antitumor Activity of Leu16VhY/VkZ Molecules in Mice Reconstituted with Human Immune Cells</heading><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In the SCID model reconstituted with human B cells, mice were injected i.v. with 5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>CD20+ Daudi lymphoma cells on Day 0 and 4.5&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>human PBMC on C 5. One group (n=8) of mice received PBS only; one group received antibody only (500 mg on Days 7, 9 and 11); one group received immunocytokine only (20 mg on Days 11-15); and one group received the combination of antibody (500 mg on Days 7, 9 and 11) and immunocytokine (20 mg on Days 11-15). All mice were checked for the presence of human antibodies in their serum by anti-human IgG ELISA on Days 21 and 34.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Targeting CD20 on B lymphoma cells is complicated by the fact that the antigen is expressed on normal B cells. Thus, therapy involves the targeted depletion of tumor cells in the background of a vast number of normal B cells. Since IL-2 immunocytokine dosing is likely to be limited by the toxicity of the IL-2 component, it is unlikely that the high doses required for normal B cell depletion by the naked antibody could be used for Leu16VhY/VkZ-IL2. Combination treatment is a likely clinical approach in which Leu16VhY/VkZ-IL2 therapy would follow rituximab treatment to first de-bulk both CD20+ tumor cells and normal B cells.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In an attempt to create a more realistic tumor model mice were injected with PBMC containing human B cells and then compared monotherapy with rituximab or Leu16VhY/VkZ-IL2 (labeled DILeu16-IL2 in Table 3) as well as the combination in which the antibody is given as a single dose at Day 7, followed by a course of therapy with Leu16VhY/VkZ-IL2 beginning on Day 11. A second set of mice were not implanted with human PBMC but received the same treatment regimens. Confirmation that B cells had been implanted was obtained by measuring levels of human IgG in all mice groups.

Without wishing to be bound by theory, this may be due in part to the ability of Leu16VhY/VkZ-IL2 alone to eliminate the majority of implanted B cells, as well as tumor cells. The level of activity of Leu16VhY/VkZ-IL2 in this model was markedly reduced compared to earlier experiments due to the delay in initiating treatment (Day 11 vs. Day 7) however, it should be noted that only a single course of treatment was used to compare different molecules and additional cycles of treatment would be used clinically. The combination of a single dose of rituximab, followed by a single course of Leu16VhY/VkZ-IL2 had at least additive anti-tumor activity with the majority of mice remaining disease free at the end of the experiment (Day 120).</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">Example 8</heading><heading id="h-0024" level="1">General Methods for Removing T Cell Epitopes from Anti-CD20 Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Haisma et al. (<i>Blood </i>92:184 (1998)) have described another anti-CD20 antibody, termed 1H4, whose V-regions are about 95% identical to the V-regions of Leu16. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows an alignment of the heavy and light (kappa) V-regions of 2B8, Leu16, their epitope-depleted derivatives according to the invention, and 1H4.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">From the finding that the antibodies 2B8, Leu16, and 1H4 are so similar in sequence, it is likely that all of these antibodies recognize the same epitope in CD20. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that CD20 is a highly conserved protein between mouse and humans, and that there is a sequence CEPA<u style="single">NPS</u>EKNSPSTQYC (SEQ ID NO: 38) in the extracellular domain of human CD20 that corresponds to the sequence CEPS<u style="single">NSS</u>EKNSPSTQYC (SEQ ID NO: 29) in mouse CD20. In human CD20, the sequence NPS (underlined) is not N-glycosylated, while the corresponding sequence NSS (underlined) in mouse CD20 is N-glycosylated. The lack of N-glycosylation in the human CD20 reveals an antibody epitope that is absent in mouse CD20, so that when mice are immunized with human CD20, this epitope will not be recognized as &#x201c;self&#x201d; by the mouse immune system.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Thus, according to the invention, the native V-regions of a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20 are at least 80% identical in sequence, and more often at least 90% identical in sequence, to Leu16 or 2B8 V-regions. The antibody 1H4 is one such example. Accordingly, T cell epitopes in an anti-CD20 antibody, for example 1H4, can be removed by first aligning the heavy and light chain V-regions with Leu16, 2B8, and the corresponding epitope-depleted variants shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, and then by introducing mutations in the V-regions of the CD20 antibody, such as 1H4, that correspond to the mutations introduced in epitope-depleted versions of Leu16 and/or 2B8. The alignments can be performed by manual alignment or using well-known alignment programs such as BLAST.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">For example, using the alignments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, it is apparent that an anti-CD20 Vh domain with one or more of the following amino acid segments is generated: SGAELKKPGAS, VSCKASGYT, LEWTGAIY, YNQKFKGKT, FKGKTTLTA, YMELSSLRS, SSLRSEDTAV, and DWGTGTTVT (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 15-22, respectively). Similarly, using the alignments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, it is apparent that an anti-CD20 light chain variable domain with one or more of the following amino acid segments is generated: IITASPGEKV, CRASTSASY, QQKPTSSP, LASGVPSRF, FSGSGSGTT, and YSMTISSLE (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 23-28, respectively). In particular, a variant of the antibody 1H4 with one or more of the preceding amino acid segments of this paragraph can be generated, which has the utility of the newly introduced mutations, using a variety of methods known in the art. For example, methods such as those of Carr et al. (U.S. Patent Application 20030153043 and WO02/069232) may be used. Alternatively, peptides corresponding to potential T cell epitopes may be added to immune cells, preferably human immune cells, and tested for the ability to stimulate cell proliferation according to standard techniques.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The corresponding V-region-containing polypeptide compositions can be configured as whole antibodies, antibody fusion proteins, Fabs, Fab fusion proteins, single-chain Fv proteins, or other standard configurations of antibody V-regions.
