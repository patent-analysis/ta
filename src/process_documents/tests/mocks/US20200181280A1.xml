effective for destroying or inhibiting the growth of undesirable cells, e.g., cancer cells. Accordingly, PE may be useful for treating or preventing diseases such as, e.g., cancer. However, PE may be highly immunogenic. Accordingly, PE administration may stimulate an anti-PE immune response including, for example, the production of anti-PE antibodies and/or T-cells, that undesirably neutralizes the cytotoxic activity of PE. Such immunogenicity may reduce the amount of PE that can be given to the patient which may, in turn, reduce the effectiveness of the PE for treating the disease, e.g., cancer. Thus, there is a need for improved PE.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several deimmunized <i>Pseudomonas </i>exotoxins (PE) are known in art. The domain II deleted versions (for example, PE24) may be less immunogenic and may cause fewer side effects (such as, for example, capillary leak syndrome and hepatotoxicity) as compared to PE38, which contains domain II. Without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that the reduced immunogenicity and fewer side effects of PE24 could, at least in part, be due to the reduced size of PE24, which disadvantageously results in a shorter serum half life. Different furin cleavable linkers may be employed in PE24 variants. PE immunoconjugates have mostly used dsFv fragments as targeting moieties. Such deimmunized <i>Pseudomonas </i>exotoxins (PE) are described in, for example, International Patent Application Publications WO2005052006, WO2007016150, WO2007014743, WO2007031741, WO200932954, WO201132022, WO2012/154530, and WO 2012/170617.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Previous immunotoxins have many disadvantages. For example, deimmunization of previous immuntoxins has been incomplete with respect to the human B-cell epitopes because immunogenic reactions still occurred. In addition, the deimmunization of previous immunotoxins was accompanied by a reduced cytotoxic potency. For example, a LO10 deimmunized PE variant described in WO 2012/170617 provided a loss of potency of at least 40% compared to wild type (WT) PE and other PE variants. In International Patent Application Publication WO2013/040141, <i>Pseudomonas </i>exotoxins with less immunogenic B-cell epitopes have been described. In the PE variant LRO10, all B-cell epitopes were removed. This, however, also led to a reduction of cytotoxicity towards tumor cells.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, fusion of a dsFv with domain II deleted versions of PE (PE24) have a shorter serum half life due to their reduced overall size as compared to dsFv fusions with PE38. The linkers of previous immunoxins also contained T-cell epitopes and poor developability such as, for example, a poor stability at 37&#xb0; C. In addition, previous anti-mesothelin (MSLN) immunotoxins have only used mouse-derived dsFv fragments fused to PE, which may further contribute to immunogenicity. International Patent Application Publication WO 2012/154530 refers to <i>Pseudomonas </i>exotoxin variant chimeric molecules with short flexible linkers which improve the cytotoxicity towards tumor cells.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention relates to deimmunized <i>Pseudomonas </i>exotoxins and Fab fusions thereof (e.g., humanized anti-MSLN), methods for the treatment of cancer, stabilized pharmaceutical formulations, methods for the reduction of side effects and methods for enhancing the serum half life and optimizing treatment schedule.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An embodiment of the invention provides a <i>Pseudomonas </i>exotoxin A (PE) comprising a PE amino acid sequence, wherein one or more of amino acid residues F443, R456, L477, R494, and L552 as defined by reference to SEQ ID NO: 1 are, independently, substituted, wherein the PE optionally has:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">(i) a further substitution of one or more amino acid residues within one or more B cell epitopes, and the further substitution for an amino acid within one or more B-cell epitopes is a substitution of, independently, one or more of amino acid residues D403, D406, R412, R427, E431, R432, D461, R463, R467, R490, R505, R513, E522, R538, E548, R551, R576, Q592, and L597 as defined by reference to SEQ ID NO: 1,</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">(ii) a further substitution of one or more amino acid residues within one or more T-cell epitopes,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">(iii) a deletion of one or more continuous amino acid residues of residues 1-273 and 285-394 as defined by SEQ ID NO: 1, or</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">(iv) a combination of any one, two, or three of (i)-(iii).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another embodiment of the invention provides an isolated, mutated <i>Pseudomonas </i>exotoxin A (PE), comprising a sequence of the following formula:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>R<sup>1</sup><sub>n</sub>-FCS-R<sup>2</sup><sub>n</sub>&#x2014;R<sup>3</sup><sub>n</sub>-PE functional domain III<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">wherein:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">n=0 or 1 independently for each of R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2 </sup>and R<sup>3</sup>,</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">R<sup>1</sup>=1 to 10 amino acid residues</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">FCS=a furin cleavage sequence of amino acid residues, which sequence is cleavable by furin and has an amino end and a carboxyl end,</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">R<sup>2</sup>=1 to 10 amino acid residues;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">R<sup>3</sup>=1 or more contiguous residues of residues 365-394 of SEQ ID NO:1;

The native, wild-type PE sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,095, which is incorporated herein by reference. Native, wild-type PE includes three structural domains that contribute to cytotoxicity. Domain Ia (amino acids 1-252) mediates cell binding, domain II (amino acids 253-364) mediates translocation into the cytosol, and domain III (amino acids 400-613) mediates ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2. While the structural boundary of domain III of PE is considered to start at residue 400, it is contemplated that domain III may require a segment of domain Ib to retain ADP-ribosylating activity. Accordingly, functional domain III is defined as residues 395-613 of PE. The function of domain Ib (amino acids 365-399) remains undefined. Without being bound by a particular theory or mechanism, it is believed that the cytotoxic activity of PE occurs through the inhibition of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells, e.g., by the inactivation of the ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0076">Substitutions of PE are defined herein by reference to the amino acid sequence of PE. Thus, substitutions of PE are described herein by reference to the amino acid residue present at a particular position, followed by the amino acid with which that residue has been replaced in the particular substitution under discussion. In this regard, the positions of the amino acid sequence of a particular embodiment of a PE are referred to herein as the positions of the amino acid sequence of the particular embodiment or as the positions as defined by SEQ ID NO: 1. When the positions are as defined by SEQ ID NO: 1, then the actual positions of the amino acid sequence of a particular embodiment of a PE are defined relative to the corresponding positions of SEQ ID NO: 1 and may represent different residue position numbers than the residue position numbers of SEQ ID NO: 1. Thus, for example, substitutions refer to a replacement of an amino acid residue in the amino acid sequence of a particular embodiment of a PE corresponding to the indicated position of the 613-amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 with the understanding that the actual positions in the respective amino acid sequences may be different. For example, when the positions are as defined by SEQ ID NO: 1, the term &#x201c;R490&#x201d; refers to the arginine normally present at position 490 of SEQ ID NO: 1, &#x201c;R490A&#x201d; indicates that the arginine normally present at position 490 of SEQ ID NO: 1 is replaced by an alanine, while &#x201c;K590Q&#x201d; indicates that the lysine normally present at position 590 of SEQ ID NO: 1 has been replaced with a glutamine. In the event of multiple substitutions at two or more positions, the two or more substitutions may be the same or different, i.e., each amino acid residue of the two or more amino acid residues being substituted can be substituted with the same or different amino acid residue unless explicitly indicated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0077">The terms &#x201c;<i>Pseudomonas </i>exotoxin&#x201d; and &#x201c;PE&#x201d; as used herein include PE that has been modified from the native protein to reduce or to eliminate immunogenicity. Such modifications may include, but are not limited to, elimination of domain Ia, various amino acid deletions in domains Ib, II, and III, single amino acid substitutions and the addition of one or more sequences at the carboxyl terminus such as DEL and REDL (SEQ ID NO: 7). See Siegall et al., J. Biol. Chem., 264: 14256-14261 (1989). Such modified PEs may be further modified to include any of the inventive substitution(s) for one or more amino acid residues within one or more T-cell and/or B-cell epitopes described herein. In an embodiment, the modified PE may be a cytotoxic fragment of native, wild-type PE. Cytotoxic fragments of PE may include those which are cytotoxic with or without subsequent proteolytic or other processing in the target cell (e.g., as a protein or pre-protein). In a preferred embodiment, the cytotoxic fragment of PE retains at least about 20%, preferably at least about 40%, more preferably at least about 50%, even more preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 90%, and still more preferably at least about 95% of the cytotoxicity of native PE. In particularly preferred embodiments, the cytotoxic fragment has at least the cytotoxicity of native PE, and preferably has increased cytotoxicity as compared to native PE.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0078">Modified PE that reduces or eliminates immunogenicity includes, for example, PE4E, PE40, PE38, PE25, PE38QQR, PE38KDEL, and PE35. In an embodiment, the PE may be any of PE4E, PE40, PE38, PE25, PE38QQR (in which PE38 has the sequence QQR added at the C-terminus), PE38KDEL (in which PE38 has the sequence KDEL (SEQ ID NO: 5) added at the C-terminus), PE-LR (resistance to lysosomal degradation)(also referred to as PE24), PE24-LO10, and PE35.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0079">In an embodiment, the PE has been modified to reduce immunogenicity by deleting domain Ia as described in in U.S. Pat. No. 4,892,827, which is incorporated herein by reference. The PE may also be modified by substituting certain residues of domain Ia. In an embodiment, the PE may be PE4E, which is a substituted PE in which domain Ia is present but in which the basic residues of domain Ia at positions 57, 246, 247, and 249 are replaced with acidic residues (e.g., glutamic acid), as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,658, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0080">PE40 is a truncated derivative of PE (Pai et al., <i>Proc. Nat'lAcad. Sci</i>. USA, 88: 3358-62 (1991) and Kondo et al., <i>Biol. Chem., </i>263: 9470-9475 (1988)). PE35 is a 35 kD carboxyl-terminal fragment of PE in which amino acid residues 1-279 have been deleted and the molecule commences with a Met at position 280 followed by amino acids 281-364 and 381-613 of native PE. PE35 and PE40 are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,602,095 and 4,892,827, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. PE25 contains the 11-residue fragment from domain II and all of domain III. In some embodiments, the PE contains only domain III.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0081">In a preferred embodiment, the PE is PE38. PE38 contains the translocating and ADP ribosylating domains of PE but not the cell-binding portion (Hwang J. et al., <i>Cell, </i>48: 129-136 (1987)). PE38 is a truncated PE pro-protein composed of amino acids 253-364 and 381-613 which is activated to its cytotoxic form upon processing within a cell (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,608,039, which is incorporated herein by reference, and Pastan et al., <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta, </i>1333: C1-C6 (1997)).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0082">In another preferred embodiment, the PE is PE-LR. PE-LR contains a deletion of domain II except for a furin cleavage sequence (FCS) corresponding to amino acid residues 274-284 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (RHRQPRGWEQL (SEQ ID NO: 8)) and a deletion of amino acid residues 365-394 of domain Ib. Thus, PE-LR contains amino acid residues 274-284 and 395-613 of SEQ ID NO: 1. PE-LR is described in International Patent Application Publication WO 2009/032954, which is incorporated herein by reference. The PE-LR may, optionally, additionally comprise a GGS (SEQ ID NO: 283) linking peptide between the FCS and amino acid residues 395-613 of SEQ ID NO: 1.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">As noted above, alternatively or additionally, some or all of domain Ib may be deleted with the remaining portions joined by a bridge or directly by a peptide bond. Alternatively or additionally, some of the amino portion of domain II may be deleted. Alternatively or additionally, the C-terminal end may contain the native sequence of residues 609-613 (REDLK) (SEQ ID NO: 6), or may contain a variation that may maintain the ability of the PE to translocate into the cytosol, such as KDEL (SEQ ID NO: 5) or REDL (SEQ ID NO: 7), and repeats of these sequences. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,854,044; 5,821,238; and 5,602,095 and International Patent Application Publication WO 1999/051643, which are incorporated herein by reference.

A quantitative decrease in immunogenicity encompasses a decrease in the magnitude or degree of the immune response. The magnitude or degree of immunogenicity can be measured on the basis of any number of known parameters, such as a decrease in the level of cytokine (e.g., antigen-specific cytokine) production (cytokine concentration), a decrease in the number of lymphocytes activated (e.g., proliferation of lymphocytes (e.g., antigen-specific lymphocytes)) or recruited, and/or a decrease in the production of antibodies (antigen-specific antibodies), etc. A qualitative decrease in immunogenicity encompasses any change in the nature of the immune response that renders the immune response less effective at mediating the reduction of the cytotoxic activity of the PE. Methods of measuring immunogenicity are known in the art. For example, measuring the types and levels of cytokines produced can measure immunogenicity. Alternatively or additionally, measuring the binding of PE to antibodies (e.g., antibodies previously exposed to PE) and/or measuring the ability of the PE to induce antibodies when administered to a mammal (e.g., humans, mice, and/or mice in which the mouse immune system is replaced with a human immune system) can measure immunogenicity. A less immunogenic PE may be characterized by a decrease in the production of cytokines such as any one or more of IFN-&#x3b3;, TNF-&#x3b1;, and granzyme B, and/or a reduced stimulation of a cell-mediated immune response, such as a decrease in the proliferation and activation of T-cells and/or macrophages specific for PE as compared to that obtained with an unsubstituted PE. Alternatively or additionally, less immunogenic PE may be characterized by an increase in the production of TGF-beta and/or IL-10 as compared to that obtained with an unsubstituted PE. In a preferred embodiment, reduced immunogenicity is characterized by any one or more of a decrease in T cell stimulation, a decrease in T cell proliferation, and a decrease in T cell IFN&#x3b3; and/or granzyme B secretion. Alternatively or additionally, a less immunogenic PE may be characterized by a decrease in the stimulation and/or activation of B-cells specific for PE as compared to that obtained with an unsubstituted PE. For example, less immunogenic PE may be characterized by a decrease in the differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells and/or memory cells as compared to that obtained with an unsubstituted PE. Reduced immunogenicity may be characterized by any one or more of a decrease in B cell stimulation, a decrease in B cell proliferation, and a decrease in anti-PE antibody secretion.

(Gaithersburg, Md.), and Multiple Peptide Systems (San Diego, Calif.). In this respect, the inventive PEs and chimeric molecules can be synthetic, recombinant, isolated, and/or purified.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0313">It may be desirable, in some circumstances, to free the PE from the targeting moiety when the chimeric molecule has reached one or more target cells. In this regard, the inventive chimeric molecules may comprise a cleavable linker. The linker may be cleavable by any suitable means, e.g., enzymatically. For example, when the target cell is a cancer (e.g., tumor) cell, the chimeric molecule may include a linker cleavable under conditions present at the tumor site (e.g., when exposed to tumor-associated enzymes or acidic pH).</p><p id="p-0325" num="0314">An embodiment of the invention provides a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding any of the inventive PEs or the inventive chimeric molecules described herein. The term &#x201c;nucleic acid,&#x201d; as used herein, includes &#x201c;polynucleotide,&#x201d; &#x201c;oligonucleotide,&#x201d; and &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule,&#x201d; and generally means a polymer of DNA or RNA, which can be single-stranded or double-stranded, which can be synthesized or obtained (e.g., isolated and/or purified) from natural sources, which can contain natural, non-natural or altered nucleotides, and which can contain a natural, non-natural, or altered internucleotide linkage, such as a phosphoroamidate linkage or a phosphorothioate linkage, instead of the phosphodiester found between the nucleotides of an unmodified oligonucleotide. It is generally preferred that the nucleic acid does not comprise any insertions, deletions, inversions, and/or substitutions. However, it may be suitable in some instances, as discussed herein, for the nucleic acid to comprise one or more insertions, deletions, inversions, and/or substitutions.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0315">Preferably, the nucleic acids of the invention are recombinant. As used herein, the term &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; refers to (i) molecules that are constructed outside living cells by joining natural or synthetic nucleic acid segments, or (ii) molecules that result from the replication of those described in (i) above. For purposes herein, the replication can be in vitro replication or in vivo replication.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0316">The nucleic acids can be constructed based on chemical synthesis and/or enzymatic ligation reactions using procedures known in the art. See, for example, Sambrook et al., supra, and Ausubel et al., supra. For example, a nucleic acid can be chemically synthesized using naturally occurring nucleotides or variously modified nucleotides designed to increase the biological stability of the molecules or to increase the physical stability of the duplex formed upon hybridization (e.g., phosphorothioate derivatives and acridine substituted nucleotides). Examples of modified nucleotides that can be used to generate the nucleic acids include, but are not limited to, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-chlorouracil, 5-iodouracil, hypoxanthine, xanthine, 4-acetylcytosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxymethyl) uracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluracil, dihydrouracil, beta-D-galactosylqueosine, inosine, N<sup>6</sup>-isopentenyladenine, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2-dimethylguanine, 2-methyladenine, 2-methylguanine, 3-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N<sup>6</sup>-substituted adenine, 7-methylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyluracil, 5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5&#x2032;-methoxycarboxymethyluracil, 5-methoxyuracil, 2-methylthio-N<sup>6</sup>-isopentenyladenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), wybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, 3-(3-amino-3-N-2-carboxypropyl) uracil, and 2,6-diaminopurine. Alternatively, one or more of the nucleic acids of the invention can be purchased from companies, such as Macromolecular Resources (Fort Collins, Colo.) and Synthegen (Houston, Tex.).</p><p id="p-0328" num="0317">The invention also provides a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence which is complementary to the nucleotide sequence of any of the nucleic acids described herein or a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent conditions to the nucleotide sequence of any of the nucleic acids described herein.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0318">The nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent conditions preferably hybridizes under high stringency conditions. By &#x201c;high stringency conditions&#x201d; is meant that the nucleotide sequence specifically hybridizes to a target sequence (the nucleotide sequence of any of the nucleic acids described herein) in an amount that is detectably stronger than non-specific hybridization. High stringency conditions include conditions which would distinguish a polynucleotide with an exact complementary sequence, or one containing only a few scattered mismatches, from a random sequence that happened to have only a few small regions (e.g., 3-10 bases) that matched the nucleotide sequence. Such small regions of complementarity are more easily melted than a full-length complement of 14-17 or more bases, and high stringency hybridization makes them easily distinguishable. Relatively high stringency conditions would include, for example, low salt and/or high temperature conditions, such as provided by about 0.02-0.1 M NaCl or the equivalent, at temperatures of about 50-70&#xb0; C. Such high stringency conditions tolerate little, if any, mismatch between the nucleotide sequence and the template or target strand, and are particularly suitable for detecting expression of any of the inventive PEs or chimeric molecules. It is generally appreciated that conditions can be rendered more stringent by the addition of increasing amounts of formamide.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0319">The invention also provides a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence that is about 70% or more, e.g., about 80% or more, about 90% or more, about 91% or more, about 92% or more, about 93% or more, about 94% or more, about 95% or more, about 96% or more, about 97% or more, about 98% or more, or about 99% or more identical to any of the nucleic acids described herein.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0320">The nucleic acids of the invention can be incorporated into a recombinant expression vector. In this regard, the invention provides recombinant expression vectors comprising any of the nucleic acids of the invention. For purposes herein, the term &#x201c;recombinant expression vector&#x201d; means a genetically-modified oligonucleotide or polynucleotide construct that permits the expression of an mRNA, protein, polypeptide, or peptide by a host cell, when the construct comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding the mRNA, protein, polypeptide, or peptide, and the vector is contacted with the cell under conditions sufficient to have the mRNA, protein, polypeptide, or peptide expressed within the cell. The vectors of the invention are not naturally-occurring as a whole. However, parts of the vectors can be naturally-occurring. The inventive recombinant expression vectors can comprise any type of nucleotides, including, but not limited to DNA and RNA, which can be single-stranded or double-stranded, which can be synthesized or obtained in part from natural sources, and which can contain natural, non-natural or altered nucleotides. The recombinant expression vectors can comprise naturally-occurring, non-naturally-occurring internucleotide linkages, or both types of linkages. Preferably, the non-naturally occurring or altered nucleotides or internucleotide linkages does not hinder the transcription or replication of the vector.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0321">The recombinant expression vector of the invention can be any suitable recombinant expression vector, and can be used to transform or transfect any suitable host cell. Suitable vectors include those designed for propagation and expansion or for expression or for both, such as plasmids and viruses. The vector can be selected from the group consisting of the pUC series (Fermentas Life Sciences), the pBluescript series (Stratagene, LaJolla, Calif.), the pET series (Novagen, Madison, Wis.), the pGEX series (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), and the pEX series (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.). Bacteriophage vectors, such as &#x3bb;GT10, &#x3bb;GT11, &#x3bb;ZapII (Stratagene), kEMBL4, and XNM1149, also can be used. Examples of plant expression vectors include pBI01, pBI101.2, pBI101.3, pBI121 and pBIN19 (Clontech). Examples of animal expression vectors include pEUK-C1, pMAM, and pMAMneo (Clontech). Preferably, the recombinant expression vector is a viral vector, e.g., a retroviral vector.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0322">The recombinant expression vectors of the invention can be prepared using standard recombinant DNA techniques described in, for example, Sambrook et al., supra, and Ausubel et al., supra. Constructs of expression vectors, which are circular or linear, can be prepared to contain a replication system functional in a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell. Replication systems can be derived, e.g., from ColE1, 2&#x3bc; plasmid, &#x3bb;, SV40, bovine papilloma virus, and the like.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0323">Desirably, the recombinant expression vector comprises regulatory sequences, such as transcription and translation initiation and termination codons, which are specific to the type of host (e.g., bacterium, fungus, plant, or animal) into which the vector is to be introduced, as appropriate and taking into consideration whether the vector is DNA- or RNA-based.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0324">The recombinant expression vector can include one or more marker genes, which allow for selection of transformed or transfected hosts. Marker genes include biocide resistance, e.g., resistance to antibiotics, heavy metals, etc., complementation in an auxotrophic host to provide prototrophy, and the like. Suitable marker genes for the inventive expression vectors include, for instance, neomycin/G418 resistance genes, hygromycin resistance genes, histidinol resistance genes, tetracycline resistance genes, and ampicillin resistance genes.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0325">The recombinant expression vector can comprise a native or nonnative promoter operably linked to the nucleotide sequence encoding the inventive PE or chimeric molecule (including functional portions and functional variants), or to the nucleotide sequence which is complementary to or which hybridizes to the nucleotide sequence encoding the PE or chimeric molecule. The selection of promoters, e.g., strong, weak, inducible, tissue-specific, and developmental-specific, is within the ordinary skill of the artisan. Similarly, the combining of a nucleotide sequence with a promoter is also within the ordinary skill of the artisan. The promoter can be a non-viral promoter or a viral promoter, e.g., a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, an SV40 promoter, an RSV promoter, or a promoter found in the long-terminal repeat of the murine stem cell virus.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0326">The inventive recombinant expression vectors can be designed for either transient expression, for stable expression, or for both. Also, the recombinant expression vectors can be made for constitutive expression or for inducible expression.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0327">Another embodiment of the invention further provides a host cell comprising any of the recombinant expression vectors described herein. As used herein, the term &#x201c;host cell&#x201d; refers to any type of cell that can contain the inventive recombinant expression vector. The host cell can be a eukaryotic cell, e.g., plant, animal, fungi, or algae, or can be a prokaryotic cell, e.g., bacteria or protozoa. The host cell can be a cultured cell, an adherent cell or a suspended cell, i.e., a cell that grows in suspension. For purposes of producing a recombinant inventive PE or chimeric molecule, the host cell is preferably a prokaryotic cell, e.g., an <i>E. coli </i>cell.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0328">Also provided by the invention is a population of cells comprising at least one host cell described herein. The population of cells can be a heterogeneous population comprising the host cell comprising any of the recombinant expression vectors described, in addition to at least one other cell, e.g., a host cell which does not comprise any of the recombinant expression vectors. Alternatively, the population of cells can be a substantially homogeneous population, in which the population comprises mainly (e.g., consisting essentially of) host cells comprising the recombinant expression vector. The population also can be a clonal population of cells, in which all cells of the population are clones of a single host cell comprising a recombinant expression vector, such that all cells of the population comprise the recombinant expression vector. In one embodiment of the invention, the population of cells is a clonal population of host cells comprising a recombinant expression vector as described herein.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0329">The inventive PEs, chimeric molecules (including functional portions and functional variants), nucleic acids, recombinant expression vectors, host cells (including populations thereof), and populations of cells can be isolated and/or purified. The term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; as used herein means having been removed from its natural environment. The term &#x201c;purified&#x201d; as used herein means having been increased in purity, wherein &#x201c;purity&#x201d; is a relative term, and not to be necessarily construed as absolute purity. For example, the purity can be about 50% or more, about 60% or more, about 70% or more, about 80% or more, about 90% or more, or about 100%. The purity preferably is about 90% or more (e.g., about 90% to about 95%) and more preferably about 98% or more (e.g., about 98% to about 99%).</p><p id="p-0341" num="0330">The inventive PEs, chimeric molecules (including functional portions and functional variants), nucleic acids, recombinant expression vectors, host cells (including populations thereof), and populations of cells, all of which are collectively referred to as &#x201c;inventive PE materials&#x201d; hereinafter, can be formulated into a composition, such as a pharmaceutical composition. In this regard, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising any of the PEs, chimeric molecules (including functional portions and functional variants), nucleic acids, recombinant expression vectors, host cells (including populations thereof), and populations of cells, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The inventive pharmaceutical composition containing any of the inventive PE materials can comprise more than one inventive PE material, e.g., a polypeptide and a nucleic acid, or two or more different PEs. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition can comprise an inventive PE material in combination with one or more other pharmaceutically active agents or drugs, such as a chemotherapeutic agents, e.g., asparaginase, busulfan, carboplatin, cisplatin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, gemcitabine, hydroxyurea, methotrexate, paclitaxel, rituximab, vinblastine, vincristine, etc.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0331">Preferably, the carrier is a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. With respect to pharmaceutical compositions, the carrier can be any of those conventionally used and is limited only by chemico-physical considerations, such as solubility and lack of reactivity with the active compound(s), and by the route of administration. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers described herein, for example, vehicles, adjuvants, excipients, and diluents, are well-known to those skilled in the art and are readily available to the public. It is preferred that the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier be one which is chemically inert to the active agent(s) and one which has no detrimental side effects or toxicity under the conditions of use.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0332">The choice of carrier will be determined in part by the particular inventive PE material, as well as by the particular method used to administer the inventive PE material. Accordingly, there are a variety of suitable formulations of the pharmaceutical composition of the invention. The following formulations for parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intradermal, interperitoneal, and intrathecal), oral, and aerosol administration are exemplary and are in no way limiting. More than one route can be used to administer the inventive PE materials, and in certain instances, a particular route can provide a more immediate and more effective response than another route.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0333">Topical formulations are well-known to those of skill in the art. Such formulations are particularly suitable in the context of the invention for application to the skin.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0334">Formulations suitable for oral administration can include (a) liquid solutions, such as an effective amount of the inventive PE material dissolved in diluents, such as water, saline, or orange juice; (b) capsules, sachets, tablets, lozenges, and troches, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as solids or granules; (c) powders; (d) suspensions in an appropriate liquid; and (e) suitable emulsions. Liquid formulations may include diluents, such as water and alcohols, for example, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, and the polyethylene alcohols, either with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant. Capsule forms can be of the ordinary hard- or soft-shelled gelatin type containing, for example, surfactants, lubricants, and inert fillers, such as lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate, and corn starch. Tablet forms can include one or more of lactose, sucrose, mannitol, corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid, microcrystalline cellulose, acacia, gelatin, guar gum, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, stearic acid, and other excipients, colorants, diluents, buffering agents, disintegrating agents, moistening agents, preservatives, flavoring agents, and other pharmacologically compatible excipients. Lozenge forms can comprise the inventive PE material in a flavor, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, as well as pastilles comprising the inventive PE material in an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia, emulsions, gels, and the like additionally containing such excipients as are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0335">The inventive PE material, alone or in combination with other suitable components, can be made into aerosol formulations to be administered via inhalation. These aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like. The aerosol formulations also may be formulated as pharmaceuticals for non-pressured preparations, such as in a nebulizer or an atomizer. Such spray formulations also may be used to spray mucosa.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0336">Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. The inventive PE material can be administered in a physiologically acceptable diluent in a pharmaceutical carrier, such as a sterile liquid or mixture of liquids, including water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, an alcohol, such as ethanol or hexadecyl alcohol, a glycol, such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, dimethylsulfoxide, glycerol, ketals such as 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol, ethers, poly(ethyleneglycol) 400, oils, fatty acids, fatty acid esters or glycerides, or acetylated fatty acid glycerides with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, such as a soap or a detergent, suspending agent, such as pectin, carbomers, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, or carboxymethylcellulose, or emulsifying agents and other pharmaceutical adjuvants.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0337">Oils, which can be used in parenteral formulations include petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic oils. Specific examples of oils include peanut, soybean, sesame, cottonseed, corn, olive, petrolatum, and mineral. Suitable fatty acids for use in parenteral formulations include oleic acid, stearic acid, and isostearic acid. Ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate are examples of suitable fatty acid esters.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0338">Suitable soaps for use in parenteral formulations include fatty alkali metal, ammonium, and triethanolamine salts, and suitable detergents include (a) cationic detergents such as, for example, dimethyl dialkyl ammonium halides, and alkyl pyridinium halides, (b) anionic detergents such as, for example, alkyl, aryl, and olefin sulfonates, alkyl, olefin, ether, and monoglyceride sulfates, and sulfosuccinates, (c) nonionic detergents such as, for example, fatty amine oxides, fatty acid alkanolamides, and polyoxyethylenepolypropylene copolymers, (d) amphoteric detergents such as, for example, alkyl-&#x3b2;-aminopropionates, and 2-alkyl-imidazoline quaternary ammonium salts, and (e) mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0339">The parenteral formulations will typically contain from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight of the inventive PE material in solution. Preservatives and buffers may be used. In order to minimize or eliminate irritation at the site of injection, such compositions may contain one or more nonionic surfactants having a hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of from about 12 to about 17. The quantity of surfactant in such formulations will typically range from about 5% to about 15% by weight. Suitable surfactants include polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters, such as sorbitan monooleate and the high molecular weight adducts of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base, formed by the condensation of propylene oxide with propylene glycol. The parenteral formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampoules and vials, and can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid excipient, for example, water, for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously described. The requirements for effective pharmaceutical carriers for parenteral compositions are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., <i>Pharmaceutics and Pharmacy Practice</i>, J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, Pa., Banker and Chalmers, eds., pages 238-250 (1982), and <i>ASHP Handbook on Injectable Drugs</i>, Toissel, 4th ed., pages 622-630 (1986)).</p><p id="p-0351" num="0340">It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that, in addition to the above-described pharmaceutical compositions, the inventive PE materials of the invention can be formulated as inclusion complexes, such as cyclodextrin inclusion complexes, or liposomes.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0341">For purposes of the invention, the amount or dose of the inventive PE material administered should be sufficient to effect a desired response, e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response, in the mammal over a reasonable time frame. For example, the dose of the inventive PE material should be sufficient to inhibit growth of a target cell or treat or prevent cancer in a period of from about 2 hours or longer, e.g., 12 to 24 or more hours, from the time of administration. In certain embodiments, the time period could be even longer. The dose will be determined by the efficacy of the particular inventive PE material and the condition of the mammal (e.g., human), as well as the body weight of the mammal (e.g., human) to be treated.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0342">Many assays for determining an administered dose are known in the art. An administered dose may be determined in vitro (e.g., cell cultures) or in vivo (e.g., animal studies). For example, an administered dose may be determined by determining the IC<sub>50 </sub>(the dose that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms), LD<sub>50 </sub>(the dose lethal to 50% of the population), the ED<sub>50 </sub>(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population), and the therapeutic index in cell culture and/or animal studies. The therapeutic index is the ratio of LD<sub>50 </sub>to ED<sub>50 </sub>(i.e., LD<sub>50</sub>/ED<sub>50</sub>).</p><p id="p-0354" num="0343">The dose of the inventive PE material also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side effects that might accompany the administration of a particular inventive PE material. Typically, the attending physician will decide the dosage of the inventive PE material with which to treat each individual patient, taking into consideration a variety of factors, such as age, body weight, general health, diet, sex, inventive PE material to be administered, route of administration, and the severity of the condition being treated. By way of example and not intending to limit the invention, the dose of the inventive PE material can be about 0.001 to about 1000 mg/kg body weight of the subject being treated/day, from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg body weight/day, about 0.01 mg to about 1 mg/kg body weight/day, from about 1 to about to about 1000 mg/kg body weight/day, from about 5 to about 500 mg/kg body weight/day, from about 10 to about 250 mg/kg body weight/day, about 25 to about 150 mg/kg body weight/day, or about 10 mg/kg body weight/day.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0344">Alternatively, the inventive PE materials can be modified into a depot form, such that the manner in which the inventive PE material is released into the body to which it is administered is controlled with respect to time and location within the body (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,450,150). Depot forms of inventive PE materials can be, for example, an implantable composition comprising the inventive PE materials and a porous or non-porous material, such as a polymer, wherein the inventive PE materials is encapsulated by or diffused throughout the material and/or degradation of the non-porous material. The depot is then implanted into the desired location within the body and the inventive PE materials are released from the implant at a predetermined rate.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0345">The inventive PE materials may be assayed for cytoxicity by assays known in the art. Examples of cytotoxicity assays include a WST assay, which measures cell proliferation using the tetrazolium salt WST-1 (reagents and kits available from Roche Applied Sciences), as described in International Patent Application Publication WO 2011/032022.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0346">It is contemplated that the inventive pharmaceutical compositions, PEs, chimeric molecules, nucleic acids, recombinant expression vectors, host cells, or populations of cells can be used in methods of treating or preventing cancer. Without being bound by a particular theory or mechanism, it is believed that the inventive PEs destroy or inhibit the growth of cells through the inhibition of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells, e.g., by the inactivation of the ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2). Without being bound to a particular theory or mechanism, the inventive chimeric molecules recognize and specifically bind to cell surface markers, thereby delivering the cytotoxic PE to the population of cells expressing the cell surface marker with minimal or no cross-reactivity with cells that do not express the cell surface marker. In this way, the cytoxicity of PE can be targeted to destroy or inhibit the growth of a particular population of cells, e.g., cancer cells. In this regard, the invention provides a method of treating or preventing cancer in a mammal comprising administering to the mammal any of the PEs, chimeric molecules, nucleic acids, recombinant expression vectors, host cell, population of cells, or pharmaceutical compositions described herein, in an amount effective to treat or prevent cancer in the mammal.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0347">The terms &#x201c;treat&#x201d; and &#x201c;prevent&#x201d; as well as words stemming therefrom, as used herein, do not necessarily imply 100% or complete treatment or prevention. Rather, there are varying degrees of treatment or prevention of which one of ordinary skill in the art recognizes as having a potential benefit or therapeutic effect. In this respect, the inventive methods can provide any amount of any level of treatment or prevention of cancer in a mammal.

The enriched PBMCs were subsequently exposed to a peptide library composed of 111 partially overlapping peptides spanning the sequence of PE38 and T cell activation was measured using an ELISpot assay for interleukin-2 (IL-2).</p><p id="p-0367" num="0356">Samples from 50 normal donors with no recorded previous exposure to PE38 and with a broad distribution of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles were analyzed. The cells of this population contained na&#xef;ve T cell epitope. Samples from nine mesothelioma and seven hairy cell leukemia (IIHCL) patients that were previously treated with PE-based RIT and who had developed high levels of neutralizing antibodies were also analyzed. The cells of this population contained memory T cell epitopes.

The strongest positive response is shown as &#x3e;20%, medium responses are shown as 10%-20%, weak responses are shown as 3%-10%, and the absence of a response (negative) is shown as &#x3c;3%. The results included a total of 258 positive responses, and 201 of those were weak (3-10%), 44 were medium (10-20%), and 13 were strong (&#x3e;20%), leaving a total of 5292 negative responses (&#x3c;3%). There were 122 responses in domain II (peptides 1-38) including 11 strong, 24 medium, and 87 weak responses. There were 136 responses in domain III (peptides 39-111) including two strong, 20 medium and 114 weak responses.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0358">Peptides 15 and 14 (in pool 3) provided the strongest and most frequent responses in the study with 21 and 18 positive responses, respectively. A total of 36 peptides did not provide any response. Sixteen of the 50 na&#xef;ve donors had a single epitope giving a response, as indicated by one, two, or three responses in overlapping consecutive peptides. Fifteen donors had two separate epitopes, 14 had three epitopes, and five had four epitopes. On 22 occasions, a fine screen of a positive pool did not provide a specific peptide response or was not done, resulting in five consecutive positive responses in the heat map.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0359"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates the positive and negative responses of the nine mesothelioma and the seven HCL patients. It was found that the mesothelioma patients provided 919 negative responses and 80 responses, including two strong responses (&#x3e;20%), four medium responses (10-20%), and 74 weak responses (3-10%). The two strong responses were in peptides 13 and 14, and the medium responses were in peptides 15, 35, 57 and 74. Thirty-five of the responses were in domain II (peptides 1-38) and 45 in domain III (peptides 38-111). The hot spot pattern created in the map is similar to the hot spot pattern in the na&#xef;ve donors map. The responsiveness (meaning how many epitopes were found for each patient) was higher than the donor's pattern with one patient having two epitopes, four patients having three epitopes, two patients having four epitopes and two more patients having five epitopes.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0360">Moreover, it was found that the seven HCL patients provided three strong responses (&#x3e;20%), nine medium responses (10-20%), 37 weak responses (3-10%), and 728 negative responses (&#x3c;3%). The strong responses were all in the consecutive peptides 75, 76 and 77. Twenty-two of the responses were in domain 11 and 37 responses were in domain III. Interestingly, the immunodominant epitope in peptides 14 and 15 that was identified in more than 40% of the na&#xef;ve donors and 55% of the mesothelioma patients (five out of nine samples) did not have a single response in the HCL patients. One patient responded to peptides 12 and 13 that have amino acids in common with peptides 14 and 15. However, no responses were found directly to peptides 14 and 15. This may be attributed to the biased HLA distribution of those patients' samples or to the nature of the disease.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0361">Overall, eight major epitopes were identified in PE38 that account for 93% of the responses. Because all T cell epitopes in domain II could be eliminated using the LR deletion, the five epitopes remaining in domain III were the focus of subsequent study. Table 1A summarizes the epitopes' locations, sequences, response rates, and the mutation that diminishes each with minimal disturbance to cytotoxic activity. The epitope ranking was composed of a number of factors, including the number of na&#xef;ve donors responding to the epitope, the relative strength of the response, the number of mesothelioma patients that responded, and, to a lesser extent, the HCL patients' responses. The epitopes from HCL patients were evaluated to a lesser extent in this analysis because of the HLA bias of the patient cohort and in the HCL patient population, in which HCL patients have an enrichment of BRB1_11 (Annino et al., <i>Leuk. Lymphoma, </i>14 (Suppl.) 1:63-5 (1994)). Epitope 2 spans five peptides. To simplify analysis, it was divided into two sub-epitopes: peptides 77-78 (2A) and peptides 75-76 (2B). Some donors responded to both 2A and 2B epitopes, while others responded to only one. Epitope 6 (peptides 93-96) and epitope 8 (peptides 56-59) were also divided into two sub-epitopes.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0"

The patients' DRB1 HLA alleles are shown in Table 1B. The same epitopes identified in the donor cohort were also present in the patient cohorts. One cohort was from mesothelioma patients treated with SS1P (anti-mesothelin Fv fused to P38) (Chowdhury et al., <i>Nat.

Y502A diminished the responses of both epitopes (Tables 2 and 3). For epitopes 5 and 7, alanine mutants were compared to peptide 67 and 51, respectively, and I471A and L423A had the lowest T cell response (Tables 4 and 6). To cover all 9 mer cores in epitopes 6 and 8 that contained four positive peptides, 18 mer WT and alanine variants were synthesized.

HA22-LR-T7 also has four mutations, (R505A, R427A, F443A and R551A) and had good cytotoxic activity with 113% and 100% relative activity in CA46 and Raji cells. For the construction of HA22-LR-T5, five mutations, R505A, R494A, L427A, R551A and F443A, were inserted which reduced the calculated remaining response to 39 responses. However, the protein's cytotoxic activity was severely reduced to 24% and 19% relative activity with EC<sub>50</sub>&#x3e;1 ng/ml. HA22-LR-T9 also had five point mutations (R505A, R427A, F443A, R494A and L477A). T9 had 46 calculated remaining responses; all 46 remaining responses were weak or medium). It maintained cytotoxic activity with EC<sub>50</sub>&#x3c;1 ng/ml with relative activity of 36% and 26% in CA46 and Raji cells, respectively. HA22-LR-T11 substitutes L477A in T9 with L477H which improved that activity to 0.2 ng/ml with 85% relative activity in CA46. Lastly, T18 (also referred to as &#x201c;LMB-T18&#x201d;) was the first RIT that contains six mutations and diminished all the major epitopes that were identified. It had good relative activity with IC50&#x3c;0.3 ng/ml and relative activity of 63% and 104% compared to HA22-LR in CA46 and Raji cells. To improve cytotoxic activity, a Gly-Gly-Ser peptide linker was inserted after the furin cleavage site.</p><p id="p-0406" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00011" num="00011"><table frame="none"

LMB-T18 was very potent with an EC50&#x3c;10 pM in all cell lines. Compared to MP, LMB-T18 had a small increase of 53% in activity in CA46 cells, 54% in Daudi cells and &#x3e;200% in HAL-01 cells (p=0.2, 0.06 and 0.01 respectively in Student T test); however, in Raji cells LMB-T18 had a 52% activity decrease (p=0.3 in Student T test). Without being bound by a particular theory or mechanism, it is believed that the decrease in activity in Raji cells was probably due to the domain II deletion (Weldon et al., <i>Blood, </i>113: 3792-3800 (2009)). The stability of LMB-T18 was compared with MP by heating samples for 15 minutes at various temperatures and, after cooling, measuring residual cytotoxic activities (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>) on Raji cells. MP lost 50% of its activity after 15 minutes incubation at 56&#xb0; C. Unexpectedly, LMB-T18 was more heat-resistant (p&#x3c;0.05 in Student T test); it only lost 50% of its activity after a 15-minute incubation at 70&#xb0; C. Cells from seven HCL and six chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients were used to determine activity on patient cells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27C-D</figref> show that LMB-T18 is more active than MP on CLL cells though this difference is not seen with HCL cells.</p><p id="p-0410" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00013" num="00013"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" rowsep="1">TABLE 11B</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>EC50 &#xb1; SD (pM)</entry><entry>Relative activity</entry><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Cell line</entry><entry>MP</entry><entry>LMB-T18</entry><entry>(%)</entry><entry>P value</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>CA46 (n = 4)</entry><entry>3.4 &#xb1; 1.7</entry><entry>2.2 &#xb1; 0.4</entry><entry>153</entry><entry>0.2</entry></row><row><entry>Raji (n = 4)</entry><entry>1.1 &#xb1; 0.3</entry><entry>2.3 &#xb1; 0.6</entry><entry>48</entry><entry>0.3</entry></row><row><entry>Daudi (n-4)</entry><entry>3.7 &#xb1; 1.6</entry><entry>2.4 &#xb1; 0.8</entry><entry>154</entry><entry>0.06</entry></row><row><entry>HAL-01 (n = 4)</entry><entry>25.7 &#xb1; 3&#x2003;&#x2009;</entry><entry>8.1 &#xb1; 1&#x2009;&#x2002;</entry><entry>318</entry><entry>0.01</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 6</heading><p id="p-0411" num="0387">This example demonstrates the relative activity of B and T cell epitope modified RIT.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0388">B cell epitopes in PE38 were previously identified and the bulky surface residues were mutated with alanine or serine to reduce antigenicity (Liu et al., <i>Protein Eng.

Cancer Ther., </i>12: 48-57 (2013) to fuse the dsFv fragment (via the C-terminus of VH domain) to the deimmunized PE was also used to fuse a Fab fragment (via the C-terminus of CH1 domain) to the deimmunized PE. The resulting peptide region, including parts of the CH1 domain, the linker, and part of the the deimmunized PE (SEQ ID NO: 273) was examined by TEPITOPE analysis (Bian et al., <i>Methods, </i>34: 468-475 (2004)). Potential T cell epitopes relevant for European (EU) and United States populations were identified within the region between the CH1 domain and the linker and the region between the linker and the PE24 domain. Potential T cell epitopes were characterized by a confidence number of 3 or lower. The results are shown in Table 14. As shown in Table 14, the linker region without the specific elongations (SEQ ID NO: 273) showed seven potential T-cell epitopes. One potential T-cell epitope was located in the transition region WEQLGGSPT (SEQ ID NO: 274), and the other six T-cell epitopes were located in the transition region VEPKSCKAS (SEQ ID NO: 275). Both of these regions are relevant mainly for European (EU) and Asian populations.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0399">The potential T cell epitopes were destroyed by inserting an amino acid sequence (insert) in each of the transition regions, thereby providing an insert on each of both sides of the furin cleavage site. The sequence DKTH (SEQ ID NO: 276) was inserted into the linker at a location not directly adjacent to the furin cleavage sequence (FCS), and the sequence GGG (SEQ ID NO: 277) was inserted into the linker at a location directly adjacent to the FCS without potential T-cell epitopes. The resulting elongated peptide region, including a) parts of the CH1 domain, b) the linker elongated at the Fab fusion area and elongated at the PE fusion area, and c) part of the of the the deimmunized PE comprised amino acid SEQ ID NO: 278. The elongated peptide region was studied using TEPITOPE analysis, and the results are shown in Table 15A. As shown in Table 15A, the elongated linker did not generate an alert in the TEPITOPE analysis (confidence numbers of 6 or higher) and, at the same time, provided improved stability (see Example 9.2

The VL01 promoted recovery as all VL01 combinations formed only aggregates after temperature stress but did not precipitate. Negative results of affinity measurements after temperature stress were due to these aggregates. Accordingly, the humanization variant VH1/VL1 (SEQ ID NO: 45)/(SEQ ID NO: 46) was chosen for further development. VH1 (SEQ ID NO: 45) provided favorable functionality and binding properties.

In summary, cFP0205 is much better tolerated than SS1P not only in mice, but also in cynomolgus monkeys, a fully cross-reactive species for the targeting moieties of these immunoconjugates.</p><p id="p-0554" num="0000">Characterization of Final Deimmunized PE Variant as Fab Fusion with Humanized SS1 (cFP0205)</p><p id="p-0555" num="0568">cFP0205 and SS1P were labeled with Cy5 on free amino groups.

In contrast to this, there was no staining of lung tissue observed upon cFP0205 application. Also, staining of the spleen was much less pronounced and the staining pattern was different from that of SS1P treated animals. Also in the liver, the staining with cFP0205 was drastically reduced compared to SS1P. Only isolated single cells that appear to be Kupffer cells were fluorescently stained. This suggests that the lower off-target toxicity of a Fab-PE24 compared to a dsFv-PE38 is due to differences in normal tissue distribution.</p><heading id="h-0043" level="1">Example 15</heading><p id="p-0557" num="0570">This example demonstrates the production of anti-glypican 3-PE variant chimeric molecules.</p><p id="p-0558" num="0571">An anti-glypican 3-PE variant chimeric molecule comprising a linker comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 36, a PE comprising SEQ ID NO: 37 (LO10R-456A), the variable heavy chain domain VH of SEQ ID NO: 61, and the variable light chain domain of SEQ ID NO: 62 (GPC3-PE24-LR-LO10R-456A-long-linker) was prepared by a method analogous to the method of preparing the anti-mesothelin PE variant chimeric molecule cFP-077 described in Example 12 (from cloning to purification).</p><p id="p-0559" num="0572">An anti-glypican 3-PE variant chimeric molecule comprising a linker comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 36, a PE comprising SEQ ID NO: 37 (LO10R-456A), the variable heavy chain domain VH of SEQ ID NO: 77, and the variable light chain domain of SEQ ID NO: 78 was also prepared by a method analogous to the method of preparing the anti-mesothelin PE variant chimeric molecule cFP-077 described in Example 12 (from cloning to purification).</p><heading id="h-0044" level="1">Example 16</heading><p id="p-0560" num="0573">This example demonstrates the cytotoxic properties of the anti-glypican 3-PE variant chimeric molecule GPC3-PE24-LR-LO10R-456A-long-linker as compared to GPC3-PE24-LR-LO10R.</p><p id="p-0561" num="0574">The cytotoxic potency of GPC3-PE24-LR-LO10R was compared to that of GPC3-PE24-LR-LO10R-456A-long-linker on the glypican 3-positive liver cancer cell line HepG2.
