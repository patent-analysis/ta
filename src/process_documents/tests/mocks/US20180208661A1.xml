The extracellular domain is composed of two regions: an N-terminal region of about 100 amino acids, the sequence of which exhibits similarity to equivalent regions of the GM-CSF and IL-5 receptor alpha-chains; and a region proximal to the transmembrane domain that contains four conserved cysteine residues and a WSXWS motif, common to other members of this cytokine receptor family.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The IL-3 binding domain comprises about 200 amino acid residue cytokine receptor motifs (CRMs) made up of two Ig-like folding domains. The extracellular domain of IL-3R&#x3b1; is highly glycosylated, with N-glycosylation necessary for both ligand binding and receptor signaling.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">IL-3R&#x3b1; is expressed widely throughout the hematopoietic system including hematopoietic progenitors, mast cells, erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and CD5<sup>+</sup> B-lymphocytes. Non-hematopoietic cells such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), Leydig cells, endothelial cells and stromal cells also express IL-3R&#x3b1;.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">IL-3R&#x3b1; is also expressed by cells involved in certain disease states including myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloid leukemia (for example, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)), malignant lymphoproliferative disorders such as lymphoma, allergies and autoimmune disease, such as lupus, Sj&#xf6;gren's syndrome or scleroderma.

The heavy chain constant region can be selected from any of the five isotypes: &#x3b1;, &#x3b4;, &#x3b5;, &#x3b3;, or &#x3bc;. Furthermore, heavy chains of various subclasses (such as the IgG subclasses of heavy chains) are responsible for different effector functions and thus, by choosing the desired heavy chain constant region, proteins with desired effector function can be produced. Exemplary heavy chain constant regions are gamma 1 (IgG1), gamma 2 (IgG2) and gamma 3 (IgG3), or hybrids thereof.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0154">A &#x201c;constant domain&#x201d; is a domain in an antibody the sequence of which is highly similar in antibodies/antibodies of the same type, e.g., IgG or IgM or IgE.

For example, a compound, such as an antibody, recognizes and binds to a specific protein structure rather than to proteins generally. If a compound binds to epitope &#x201c;A&#x201d;, the presence of a molecule containing epitope &#x201c;A&#x201d; (or free, unlabeled &#x201c;A&#x201d;), in a reaction containing labeled &#x201c;A&#x201d; and the compound, will reduce the amount of labeled &#x201c;A&#x201d; bound to the compound.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0159">As used herein, the term &#x201c;specifically binds&#x201d; shall be taken to mean that the binding interaction between a compound and IL-3R&#x3b1; chain is dependent on the presence of the antigenic determinant or epitope of an IL-3R&#x3b1; chain bound by the compound. The compound preferentially binds or recognizes an IL-3R&#x3b1; chain antigenic determinant or epitope even when present in a mixture of other molecules or organisms. In one example, the compound reacts or associates more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration and/or with greater affinity with IL-3R&#x3b1; or cell expressing same than it does with alternative antigens or cells. It is also understood by reading this definition that, for example, a compound specifically binds to IL-3R&#x3b1; may or may not specifically bind to a second antigen. As such. &#x201c;specific binding&#x201d; does not necessarily require exclusive binding or non-detectable binding of another antigen. The term &#x201c;specifically binds&#x201d; can be used interchangeably with &#x201c;selectively binds&#x201d; herein. Generally, reference herein to binding means specific binding, and each term shall be understood to provide explicit support for the other term. Methods for determining specific binding will be apparent to the skilled person. For example, a compound of the disclosure is contacted with IL-3R&#x3b1; or a cell expressing same or a mutant form thereof or an alternative antigen. The binding of the compound to the IL-3R&#x3b1; or mutant form or alternative antigen is then determined and a compound that binds as set out above to the IL-3R&#x3b1; rather than the mutant or alternative antigen is considered to specifically bind to IL-3R&#x3b1;. In one example, &#x201c;specific binding&#x201d; to with IL-3R&#x3b1; or cell expressing same, means that the compound binds to the with IL-3R&#x3b1; or cell expressing same with an equilibrium constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 1 &#x3bc;M or less, such as 100 nM or less, such as 50 nM or less, for example 20 nM or less, such as, 1 nM or less, e.g., 0.8 nM or less, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>M or less, such as 5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>M or less, for example, 3&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>M or less, such as 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>M or less. In one example, the K<sub>D </sub>is about 2.2&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>M or less, for example, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>M or less, for example, 9&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup>M or less, for example, about 8&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup>M or less. In one example, the K<sub>D </sub>is determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance. For example, soluble IL-3R&#x3b1; (e.g., comprising the extracellular domain of IL-3R&#x3b1;) is immobilized on a solid substrate and binding of the compound determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0160">As used herein, the term &#x201c;does not detectably bind&#x201d; shall be understood to mean that a compound binds to a candidate antigen (e.g., IL-3R&#x3b1;) at a level less than 10%, or 8% or 6% or 5% above background. The background can be the level of binding signal detected in the absence of the compound and/or in the presence of a negative control protein (e.g., an isotype control antibody) and/or the level of binding detected in the presence of a negative control antigen. The level of binding is detected using Western Blotting and/or FACS analysis of cells expressing IL-3R&#x3b1; or lacking expression of IL-3R&#x3b1; (e.g., as described herein).</p><p id="p-0191" num="0161">As used herein, phrases referring to &#x201c;reduced binding&#x201d; or &#x201c;binding being at a lower level&#x201d; in relation to an antigen will be understood to mean that a compound binds to an antigen (e.g., an alanine point mutant of SEQ ID NO: 1) with an affinity at least about 5 fold or 10 fold or 20 fold or 40 fold or 60 fold less than a control epitope or antigen (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 1). In one example, the level of binding is determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance, e.g., as described herein. In another example, the level of binding is determined by FACS. For example, a cell expressing the antigen is contacted with a labeled compound (e.g., a fluorescently labelled compound) and the amount of fluorescence on the surface of the cell determined by FACS. The level of fluorescence is considered to be related to the amount of binding of the compound. By determining the level of fluorescence in the presence and absence of the compound and the amount of fluorescence on a cell expressing a protein having the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, a compound that binds at a reduced level can be determined. In a further example, the level of binding is determined by Western blotting. For example, a recombinant mutant of IL-3R&#x3b1; as described herein and recombinant IL-3R&#x3b1; are resolved by SDS-PAGE and then contacted with labelled compound (or contacted with compound, which is then contacted with a labelled detection reagent that binds to the compound). The level of label bound is then determined (and, optionally, normalized for total amount of protein resolved) and the amount of compound bound to the IL-3R&#x3b1; and mutant form thereof determined.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0162">As used herein, the term &#x201c;contact&#x201d; will be understood to mean that a residue or chemical group of a compound of the disclosure interacts with a residue of IL-3R&#x3b1;, e.g., by a hydrogen bond, an ionic bond, a Van der Waals force, or a hydrophobic interaction.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0163">As used herein, the term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; (syn. &#x201c;antigenic determinant&#x201d;) shall be understood to mean a region of IL-3R&#x3b1; to which a compound binds. This term is not necessarily limited to the specific residues or structure to which the compound makes contact. For example, the epitope can comprise residues up to 5 or 4 or 3 or 2 or 1 residues on either side of a residue to which the compound makes contact. In one example, the residue recited herein as being within an epitope is contacted by the compound or is involved in compound binding. In some examples, the epitope comprises a series of discontinuous amino acids that are positioned close to one another when IL-3R&#x3b1; is folded, i.e., a &#x201c;conformational epitope&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0164">By &#x201c;surface exposed&#x201d; shall be understood to mean that the side chains of an amino acid residue are on the surface of a protein when folded such that they are capable of being in contact with a solvent in which the protein is present or suspended.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0165">The term &#x201c;competitively inhibits&#x201d; shall be understood to mean that a compound reduces or prevents binding of a recited antibody to IL-3R&#x3b1;. It will be apparent from the foregoing that the compound need not completely inhibit binding of the recited antibody, rather it need only reduce binding by a statistically significant amount, for example, by at least about 10% or 20% or 30% or 40% or 50% or 60% or 70% or 80% or 90% or 95%. Methods for determining competitive inhibition of binding are known in the art and/or described herein. For example, the antibody is exposed to IL-3R&#x3b1; either in the presence or absence of a compound. If less of the antibody binds in the presence of the compound than in the absence of the compound, the compound is considered to competitively inhibit binding of the antibody.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0166">By &#x201c;overlapping&#x201d; in the context of two epitopes shall be taken to mean that two epitopes share a sufficient number of amino acid residues to permit a compound that binds to one epitope to competitively inhibit the binding of a compound that binds to the other epitope. For example, the two epitopes share at least 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or more amino acids.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0167">By &#x201c;individually&#x201d; is meant that the disclosure encompasses a compound that binds to the recited antigens or groups of antigens separately, and that, notwithstanding that individual antigens or groups of antigens may not be separately listed herein the accompanying claims may define such antigens or groups of antigens separately and divisibly from each other.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0168">By &#x201c;collectively&#x201d; is meant that the disclosure encompasses a compound that binds to any number or combination of the recited antigens or groups of antigens, and that, notwithstanding that such numbers or combinations of antigens or groups of antigens may not be specifically listed herein the accompanying claims may define such combinations or sub-combinations separately and divisibly from any other combination of antigens or groups of antigens.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0169">As used herein, the term &#x201c;neutralize&#x201d; shall be taken to mean that a compound is capable of reducing or preventing IL-3-mediated signaling (syn. TL-3 signaling) in a cell and/or reducing or preventing IL-3 binding to IL-3R&#x3b1; chain and/or a heterodimer of IL-3R&#x3b1; chain and IL-3&#x3b2; chain (also known as colony stimulating factor 2 receptor). Methods for determining whether or not a compound neutralizes IL-3 signaling will be apparent to the skilled artisan. For example, recombinant cells (e.g., 293F cells) expressing IL-3R&#x3b1; and CD131 are contacted with the compound and subsequently or simultaneously (or previously) contacted with IL-3 (e.g., at a concentration 30 ng/ml) for about 20 min. STATS activity is then measured, e.g., by flow cytometry after intracellular staining with a phosphoSTAT5 antibody (pSTAT5). Reduced levels of STATS activity indicate that the compound neutralizes IL-3 signaling. In another example, Ba/F3 cells expressing IL-3R&#x3b1; and CD131 are contacted with the compound subsequently or simultaneously (or previously) contacted with increasing concentrations of IL-3 for, e.g., about 72 hours and cell proliferation determined, e.g., by tritiated-thymidine incorporation. Reduced proliferation in the presence of the compound compared to the absence of the compound indicates that the compound neutralizes IL-3 signaling.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0170">A &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain and/or hydropathicity and/or hydrophilicity. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art, including basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), &#x3b2;-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Hydropathic indices are described, for example in Kyte and Doolittle <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>157: 105-132, 1982 and hydrophylic indices are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0171">As used herein, the term &#x201c;IL-3R&#x3b1;-mediated condition&#x201d; will be understood to mean a condition associated with or caused by excessive IL-3R&#x3b1; expression and/or an excessive number of IL-3R&#x3b1; expressing cells in a mammal, such as cancer cells (e.g., leukemic cells) and/or immune cells (e.g., plasmacytoid dendritic cells).</p><p id="p-0202" num="0172">As used herein, the term &#x201c;myelodysplastic syndrome&#x201d; or &#x201c;MDS&#x201d; will be understood to refer to a diverse collection of hematological medical conditions that involve ineffective production (or dysplasia) of the myeloid class of blood cells. Subjects with MDS often develop severe anemia and can require frequent blood transfusions. In many cases, as MDS progresses the subject develops cytopenias (low blood counts) due to progressive bone marrow failure. In about one third of patients with MDS, the disease transforms into acute myclogenous leukemia (AML). The MDS can be diagnosed or classified to various systems, including the French-American-British Classification System (Bennett et al., <i>Br. J. Haematol. </i>33: 451-458, 1976), The International Prognostic Scoring System (Greenberg el al., <i>Blood </i>89: 2079-88, 1997) or a system published by the World Health Organization.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0173">As used herein, the term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; refers to clinical intervention designed to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include decreasing the rate of disease progression, ameliorating or palliating the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. An individual is successfully &#x201c;treated&#x201d;, for example, if one or more symptoms associated with a disease are mitigated or eliminated.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0174">As used herein, the term &#x201c;prevention&#x201d; includes providing prophylaxis with respect to occurrence or recurrence of a disease in an individual. An individual may be predisposed to or at risk of developing the disease or disease relapse but has not yet been diagnosed with the disease or the relapse.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0175">As used herein, a mammal &#x201c;at risk&#x201d; of developing a disease or condition or relapse thereof or relapsing may or may not have detectable disease or symptoms of disease, and may or may not have displayed detectable disease or symptoms of disease prior to the treatment according to the present disclosure. &#x201c;At risk&#x201d; denotes that a mammal has one or more risk factors, which are measurable parameters that correlate with development of the disease or condition, as known in the art and/or described herein.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0176">An &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; refers to at least an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result. An effective amount can be provided in one or more administrations. In some examples of the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; is meant an amount necessary to effect treatment of a disease or condition as hereinbefore described. The effective amount may vary according to the disease or condition to be treated and also according to the weight, age, racial background, sex, health and/or physical condition and other factors relevant to the mammal being treated. Typically, the effective amount will fall within a relatively broad range (e.g. a &#x201c;dosage&#x201d; range) that can be determined through routine trial and experimentation by a medical practitioner. The effective amount can be administered in a single dose or in a dose repeated once or several times over a treatment period.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0177">A &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; is at least the minimum concentration required to effect a measurable improvement of a particular disorder (e.g., SLE). A therapeutically effective amount herein may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the patient, and the ability of the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0178">A &#x201c;prophylactically effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount effective, at the dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically but not necessarily, since a prophylactic dose is used in mammals prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, a prophylactically effective amount may be less than a therapeutically effective amount.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0179">The &#x201c;mammal&#x201d; treated according to the present disclosure may be a mammal, such as a non-human primate or a human.

Generally, in such methods an IL-3R&#x3b1; protein or immunogenic fragment or epitope thereof or a cell expressing and displaying same (i.e., an immunogen), optionally formulated with any suitable or desired carrier, adjuvant, or pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, is administered to a non-human animal, for example, a mouse, chicken, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, dog, horse, cow, goat or pig. The immunogen may be administered intranasally, intramuscularly, sub-cutaneously, intravenously, intradermally, intraperitoneally, or by other known route.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0182">The production of polyclonal antibodies may be monitored by sampling blood of the immunized animal at various points following immunization. One or more further immunizations may be given, if required to achieve a desired antibody titer. The process of boosting and titering is repeated until a suitable titer is achieved. When a desired level of immunogenicity is obtained, the immunized animal is bled and the serum isolated and stored, and/or the animal is used to generate monoclonal antibodies (Mabs).</p><p id="p-0213" num="0183">Monoclonal antibodies are one exemplary form of antibody contemplated by the present disclosure. The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; or &#x201c;mAb&#x201d; refers to a homogeneous antibody population capable of binding to the same antigen(s), for example, to the same epitope within the antigen. This term is not intended to be limited as regards to the source of the antibody or the manner in which it is made.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0184">For the production of mAbs any one of a number of known techniques may be used, such as, for example, the procedure exemplified in U.S. Pat.

Rodents such as rabbits, mice and rats are exemplary animals. Mice genetically-engineered to express human immunoglobulin proteins and, for example, do not express murine immunoglobulin proteins, can also be used to generate an antibody of the present disclosure (e.g., as described in WO2002/066630).</p><p id="p-0216" num="0186">Following immunization, somatic cells with the potential for producing antibodies. e.g., B lymphocytes (B cells), are selected for use in the MAb generating protocol. These cells may be obtained from biopsies of spleens, tonsils or lymph nodes, or from a peripheral blood sample. The B cells from the immunized animal are then fused with cells of an immortal myeloma cell, generally derived from the same species as the animal that was immunized with the immunogen.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0187">Hybrids are amplified by culture in a selective medium comprising an agent that blocks the de novo synthesis of nucleotides in the tissue culture media.

For example, the library is an in vitro display library (e.g., a ribosome display library, a covalent display library or a mRNA display library, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,270,969). In yet another example, the display library is a phage display library wherein proteins comprising antigen binding fragments of antibodies are expressed on phage, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat.

Humanized antibodies also include antibodies in which one or more residues of the human protein are modified by one or more amino acid substitutions and/or one or more FR residues of the human antibody are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found in neither the human antibody or in the non-human antibody.

Generally, such libraries are generated from short random oligonucleotides that are expressed either in vitro or in vivo and displayed in such a way to facilitate screening of the library to identify a peptide that, is capable of specifically binding to an antigen described herein.

For example, QSAR (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship) modeling approach uses linear regressions or regression trees of compound structures to determine suitability. The software of the Chemical Computing Group. Inc. (Montreal, Canada) uses high-throughput screening experimental data on active as well as inactive compounds, to create a probabilistic QSAR model, which is subsequently used to select lead compounds. The Binary QSAR method is based upon three characteristic properties of compounds that form a &#x201c;descriptor&#x201d; of the likelihood that a particular compound will or will not perform a required function: partial charge, molar refractivity (bonding interactions), and log P (lipophilicity of molecule). Each atom has a surface area in the molecule and it has these three properties associated with it. All atoms of a compound having a partial charge in a certain range are determined and the surface areas (Van der Walls Surface Area descriptor) are summed. The binary QSAR models are then used to make activity models or ADMET models, which are used to build a combinatorial library. Accordingly, lead compounds identified in initial screens, can be used to expand the list of compounds being screened to thereby identify highly active compounds.</p><heading id="h-0033" level="2">Nucleic Acid Aptamers</heading><p id="p-0282" num="0245">In another example, a compound is a nucleic acid aptamer (adaptable oligomer). Aptamers are single stranded oligonucleotides or oligonucleotide analogs that are capable of forming a secondary and/or tertiary structure that provides the ability to bind to a particular target molecule, such as a protein or a small molecule. e.g., IL-3R&#x3b1;. Thus, aptamers are the oligonucleotide analogy to antibodies. In general, aptamers comprise about 15 to about 100 nucleotides, such as about 15 to about 40 nucleotides, for example about 20 to about 40 nucleotides, since oligonucleotides of a length that falls within these ranges can be prepared by conventional techniques.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0246">An aptamer can be isolated from or identified from a library of aptamers. An aptamer library is produced, for example, by cloning random oligonucleotides into a vector (or an expression vector in the case of an RNA aptamer), wherein the random sequence is flanked by known sequences that provide the site of binding for PCR primers. An aptamer that provides the desired biological activity (e.g., binds specifically to an epitope of IL-3R&#x3b1;) is selected. An aptamer with increased activity is selected, for example, using SELEX (Sytematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment). Suitable methods for producing and/or screening an aptamer library are described, for example, in Elloington and Szostak. <i>Nature </i>346:818-22, 1990; U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,163; and/or U.S. Pat.

Mutant forms of IL-3R&#x3b1; (e.g., comprising alanine point mutations as described herein) to which the antibody fragment is not to be able to detectably bind are then used to remove cross-reactive proteins. A screening process for immunization of a non-human mammal can also be devised based on the foregoing as can a screening method for identifying other compounds described herein.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0250">In a further example, IL-3R&#x3b1; or a cell expressing same or the N-terminal domain thereof or a soluble form thereof is contacted with IL-3.

Methods for determining if a compound contacts a residue will be apparent to the skilled artisan. For example, residues contacted by a compound can be determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis or modeling of the compound bound to IL-3R&#x3b1; or a region thereof (e.g., the extracellular domain) or by mutation analysis, e.g., alanine scanning mutagenesis (for example, as described and/or exemplified herein). For example, mutant forms of IL-3R&#x3b1; or a region thereof (e.g., the extra cellular domain) and in which one or more (e.g., two or three) residues are mutated to alanine (or a conservative amino acid substitution) are produced and binding of the mutant forms to the compound determined. Mutations that reduce binding to the compound by more than a threshold or that reduce binding to the greatest degree compared to other mutations are considered to be involved in binding to the compound.</p><heading id="h-0034" level="2">Constant Regions</heading><p id="p-0291" num="0253">The present disclosure encompasses compounds (e.g., antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof) comprising a constant region of an antibody and/or a Fc region of an antibody.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0254">Sequences of constant regions and/or Fc regions useful for producing the immunoglobulins, antibodies or antigen binding fragments of the present disclosure may be obtained from a number of different sources.

For example, synthetic peptides are prepared using known techniques of solid phase, liquid phase, or peptide condensation, or any combination thereof, and can include natural and/or unnatural amino acids. Amino acids used for peptide synthesis may be standard Boc (N&#x3b1;-amino protected N&#x3b1;-t-butyloxycarbonyl) amino acid resin with the deprotecting, neutralization, coupling and wash protocols of the original solid phase procedure of Merrifield, <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>85:2149-2154, 1963, or the base-labile N&#x3b1;-amino protected 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) amino acids described by Carpino and Han, <i>J. Org.

Normally, either the amino or carboxyl group of the first amino acid is protected by a suitable protecting group. The protected or derivatized amino acid can then be either attached to an inert solid support or utilized in solution by adding the next amino acid in the sequence having the complementary (amino or carboxyl) group suitably protected, under conditions that allow for the formation of an amide linkage. The protecting group is then removed from the newly added amino acid residue and the next amino acid (suitably protected) is then added, and so forth. After the desired amino acids have been linked in the proper sequence, any remaining protecting groups (and any solid support, if solid phase synthesis techniques are used) are removed sequentially or concurrently, to render the final polypeptide. By simple modification of this general procedure, it is possible to add more than one amino acid at a time to a growing chain, for example, by coupling (under conditions which do notracemize chiral centers) a protected tripeptide with a properly protected dipeptide to form, after deprotection, a pentapeptide.

Such a method generally involves labeling the compound (e.g., an antibody or antigen binding fragment) and contacting it with immobilized antigen.

For example, a series of overlapping peptides spanning the IL-3R&#x3b1; sequence or a region thereof comprising an epitope of interest, e.g., peptides comprising 20-50 amino acids or comprising a region set forth herein are produced. The compound is then contacted to each peptide and the peptide(s) to which it binds determined. This permits determination of peptide(s) comprising the epitope to which the compound binds.

For example, the antibody or IL-3 is conjugated to a detectable label, e.g., a fluorescent label or a radioactive label. The labeled antibody or IL-3 and the compound are then mixed and contacted with IL-3R&#x3b1; or a region thereof or a cell expressing same. The level of bound labeled antibody or IL-3 is then determined and compared to the level determined when the labeled antibody or IL-3 is contacted with the IL-3R&#x3b1;, region or cells in the absence of the compound. If the level of labeled antibody or IL-3 is reduced in the presence of the compound compared to the absence of the compound, the compound is considered to competitively inhibit binding of the labeled antibody or IL-3 to L-3R&#x3b1;.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0316">In another example, the compound is permitted to bind to IL-3R&#x3b1; or a region thereof or a cell expressing same prior to contacting the IL-3R&#x3b1;, region or cell with the labeled antibody or IL-3. A reduction in the amount of bound labeled antibody or IL-3 in the presence of the compound compared to in the absence of the compound indicates that the compound competitively inhibits binding of the labeled antibody or IL-3 to IL-3R&#x3b1;. In a more specific example, a soluble form of IL-3R&#x3b1; or a cell expressing IL-3R&#x3b1; is contacted with a compound of the disclosure for a time and under conditions to permit binding. The IL-3R&#x3b1; or cell is then contacted with labeled IL-3 for a time an under conditions sufficient to permit binding. Following washing to remove unbound or IL-3, the level of bound label is determined, e.g., by FACS or Surface Plasmon Resonance. A compound that reduces the level of bound label compared to the level of label detected following contacting soluble IL-3R&#x3b1; or a cell expressing IL-3R&#x3b1; with labeled or IL-3 in the absence of compound competitively inhibits binding of or IL-3.

These assays can be performed as a competitive binding assay using labeled IL-3 and/or labeled compound. For example, labeled IL-3R&#x3b1; or an extracellular region thereof fused to an Fc region of an antibody or a cell expressing IL-3R is immobilized and labeled IL-3 is then contacted to the immobilized receptor or cell in the presence or absence of a compound and the amount of bound label detected. A reduction in the amount of bound label in the presence of the compound compared to in the absence of the compound indicates that the compound reduces or prevents binding of IL-3 to IL-3R. By testing multiple concentrations of the compound an IC<sub>50 </sub>is determined, i.e., a concentration of the protein that reduces the amount of IL-3 that binds to IL-3R. or an EC<sub>50 </sub>can be determined, i.e., a concentration of the protein that achieves 50% of the maximum inhibition of binding of IL-3 to IL-3R achieved by the compound.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0321">In another example, the compound reduces or prevents IL-3-mediated histamine release from basophils. For example, low density leukocytes comprising basophils are incubated with IgE, IL-3 and various concentrations of the antibody or antigen binding fragment.

The amount of secreted IL-6 is then assessed, e.g., using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Control cultures do not comprise the compound (positive control) or IL-3 (negative control).
