Field of the Invention</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to apoptotic anti-IgE antibodies, nucleic acid encoding the same, therapeutic compositions thereof, and their use in the treatment of IgE-mediated disorders.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Allergy refers to certain diseases in which immune responses to environmental antigens cause tissue inflammation and organ dysfunction. The clinical features of each allergic disease reflect the immunologically induced inflammatory response in the organ or tissue involved. These features are generally independent of the chemical or physical properties of the antigen. The diversity of allergic responses arises from the involvement of different immunological effector pathways, each of which generates a unique pattern of inflammation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Allergy is common throughout the world. The predilection for specific diseases, however, varies among different age groups, sexes and races. The prevalence of sensitivity to specific allergens is determined both by genetic predilection and by the geographic and cultural factors that are responsible for exposure to the allergen. A clinical state of allergy affects only some individuals who encounter each allergen. The occurrence of allergic disease on exposure to an allergen requires not only prior &#x201c;sensitization&#x201d; but also other factors that determine the localization of the reaction to a particular organ.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A biological process that precedes the disease of allergy upon allergen exposure allergen is induces an immune response known as &#x201c;sensitization&#x201d; or the sensitization phase. Once sensitization occurs, an individual does not become symptomatic until there is a subsequent exposure to the allergen. The effect of sensitization is also known as immune memory.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One of the primary pathways by which in inflammation is induced is through the immunoglobulin E (IgE). IgE plays a central role in allergies by virtue of their role as allergen receptors on the surface of mast cells and basophils. IgE antibodies are fixed to the surface of mast cells and basophils at the Fc portion of the molecule to a high affinity cell surface receptor, called Fc&#x3b5;RI. The allergic reaction is initiated when the polyvalent allergen molecule binds to antibodies that are occupying these receptors. The result is a bridging of the Fc&#x3b5;RI, which in turn signals intracellularly causing the release and activation of mediators of inflammation: histamine, leukotrienes, chemotactic factors, platelet-activating factor, and proteinases. These activated mediators act locally and cause increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, smooth muscle contraction and mucous gland secretion. Such events are termed clinically the immediate or early phase, and occur within the first 15-30 minutes following allergen exposure. Over the succeeding 12 hours there is progressive tissue infiltration of inflammatory cells, proceeding from neutrophils to eosinophils to mononuclear cells in response to other chemical mediators not quite fully understood. This period of time 6-12 hours after allergen exposure is designated the late phase and is characterized by clinical manifestations of cellular inflammation. Given that late phase reactions, especially in the lung, occur in the absence of early phase reactions, it is still not entirely understood if the late phase reaction is necessarily IgE mediated.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">IgE exists in a membrane bound form and in a secreted form. These distinct forms appear to be splice variants. Previous approaches to achieve therapeutic effect by down regulating IgE targeting primarily the secreted form (e.g., XOLAIR&#xae; omalizumab), so as prevent or disarm further &#x201c;arming&#x201d; of the immune system. The secreted form of IgE is a shorter form, essentially the Fc region ends at the CH4 domain (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), whereas the longer form includes additional C-terminal residues including the peptides encoded by the exons known as M1/M1&#x2032; and M2. While some have reported two distinct forms of membrane bound IgE, both with and without a 52 amino acid segment known as M1&#x2032; [Batista et al., <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>184: 2197-2205 (1996)], Applicants were unable to verify that any membrane bound form lacks this M1&#x2032; segment. Conventional therapy with anti-IgE antibodies, which bind to the secreted form of IgE, results in reduction of free serum, but not total serum IgE. Casale et al., <i>J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. </i>100 (1): 110-121 (1997).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It has further been noted that in the absence of antigen signal, B-cell receptors (i.e., immunoglobulins) that are cross-linked are prone to apoptosis. Surprisingly, Applicants have found that targeting the M1&#x2032; segment of IgE with anti-IgE antibodies can result in inducing apoptosis of the B-cell. As the progeny of activated B-cells can result in plasma cells that make and secrete the secreted form of IgE, the depletion of the IgE-producing B-cell through apoptosis offers a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of allergy.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides for apoptotic anti-IgE antibodies, or functional fragments thereof, and for their use in the treatment of IgE-mediated disorders.

Such techniques are explained fully in the literature, such as, <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual</i>, second edition (Sambrook et al., 1989); <i>Oligonucleotide Synthesis </i>(M. J. Gait, ed., 1984); <i>Animal Cell Culture </i>(R. I. Freshney, ed., 1987); <i>Methods in Enzymology </i>(Academic Press, Inc.); <i>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology </i>(F. M. Ausubel et al., eds 1987, and periodic updates); <i>PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reaction</i>, (Mullis et al., ed., 1994); <i>A Practical Guide to Molecular Cloning </i>(Perbal Bernard V., 1988); <i>Phage Display: A Laboratory Manual </i>(Barbas et al., 2001).</p><p id="h-0007" num="0000">Lymphocyte Development and Activation</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The two major types of lymphocytes in humans are T (thymus-derived) and B (bone marrow derived. These cells are derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and fetal liver that have committed to the lymphoid development pathway. The progeny of these stem cells follow divergent pathways to mature into either B or T lymphocytes. Human B-lymphocyte development takes place entirely within the bone marrow. T cell, on the other hand, develop from immature precursors that leave the marrow and travel through bloodstream to the thymus, where they proliferate and differentiate into mature T lymphocytes.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Mature lymphocytes that emerge from the thymus or bone marrow are in a quiescent, or &#x201c;resting&#x201d; state, i.e., they are mitotically inactive. When dispersed into the bloodstream, these &#x201c;na&#xef;ve&#x201d; or &#x201c;virgin&#x201d; lymphocytes, travel into various secondary or peripheral lymphoid organs, such as the spleen, lymph nodes or tonsils. Most virgin lymphocytes have an inherently short life span and die without a few days after leaving the marrow or thymus. However, if such a cell receives signals that indicate the presence of an antigen, they may activate and undergo successive rounds of cell division. Some of the resulting progeny cells then revert to the resting state to become memory lymphocytes&#x2014;B and T cells that are essentially primed for the next encounter with the stimulating allergen. The other progeny of activated virgin lymphocytes are effector cells, which survive for only a few days, but carry out specific defensive activities.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Lymphocyte activation refers to an ordered series of events through which a resting lymphocyte passes as it is stimulated to divide and produce progeny, some of which become effector cells. A full response includes both the induction of cell proliferation (mitogenesis) and the expression of immunologic functions. Lymphocytes become activated when specific ligands bind to receptors on their surfaces. The ligands are different for T cells and B cells, but the resulting intracellular physiological mechanisms are similar.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">While foreign antigens themselves can induce lymphocyte activation, especially large polymeric antigens that cross-linking surface immunoglobulins on B-cells, or other glycoproteins on T-cells. However, most antigens are not polymeric and even when binding directly to the B-cell in large numbers fail to result in activation. B cells are activated by these more common antigens when they are co-stimulated with nearly activated helper T-lymphocytes. Such stimulation may occur from lymphokines secreted by the T-cell, but is transmitted most efficiently by direct contact of the B cell with T-cell surface proteins that interact with certain B-cell surface receptors to generate a secondary signal.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">B-Cells</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The defining feature of B-cells is the ability to synthesize immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins (Ig) are an extremely diverse family of proteins made up of related types of polypeptides called heavy chains and light chains. Each Ig binds specifically with high affinity to its own specific antigen. Mature B cells can express immunoglobulin in two different forms, each of which serve unique functions. In resting B lymphocytes (virgin or memory) immunoglobulins are expressed only on the cell surface, where they act essentially as membrane-bound receptor for specific antigens. In contrast, B cell effector cells (plasma cells) secrete immunoglobulin into the surrounding milieu. Such secreted immunoglobulin retain the ability to recognize and bind (vis-&#xe0;-vis the membrane-bound form on resting B-cells), and are typically referred to as antibodies.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">When an activated B-lymphocyte divides, some of it progeny become memory B cells, while the remainder differentiate into plasma cells. As plasma cells have a relatively short life span, unless new plasma cells are produced, the population soon dies out and immunoglobulins are no longer secreted. As a result, activation of B cells typically results in a transient wave of proliferation, followed by a burst of antibody secretion that increases and then subsides over several days or a few weeks. B-cells are the primary cell type involved in humoral immunity, or the protective effect mediated through tissue fluids. Because the anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibodies of the invention actually deplete B-cells, including memory B-cells, they can be used to &#x201c;reset&#x201d; memory. Thus the effect of this could be that the B-cell component that is driving the allergic response in individuals can be attenuation if not eliminated.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">T-Cells</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">T lymphocytes do not express immunoglobulins, but, instead detect the presence of foreign substances by way of surface proteins called T-cell receptors. These receptors recognize antigens by either direct contact or through influencing the activity of other immune cells. Together with macrophages, T cells are the primary cell type involved in the cell-mediated immunity.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Unlike B-cells, T-cells can detect foreign substances only in specific contexts. In particular, T-lymphocytes will recognize a foreign protein only if it first cleaved into small peptides, which are then displayed on the surface of a second host cell, called an antigen-presenting cell (APC). May types of host cells can present antigens under some conditions but certain types are more specifically adapted for this purpose and are particularly important in controlling T-cell activity, and include macrophages and other B-cells. Antigen presentation depends in part on specific proteins, called major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, on the surface of the presenting cells. Thus, to stimulate cell-mediated immunity, foreign peptides must be presented to T-cells in combination with MHC peptides, and this combination must be recognized by a T-cell receptor.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">There are two significant T-cell subsets: cytotoxic T lymphocytes (T<sub>c </sub>cells or CTLs) and helper T cells (T<sub>H</sub>) cells, which can roughly be identified on the basis of cell surface expression of the marker CD8 and CD4. Tc cells are important in viral defense, and can kill viruses directly by recognizing certain cell surface expressed viral peptides. T<sub>H </sub>cells promote proliferation, maturation and immunologic function of other cell types, e.g., lymphokine secretion to control activities of B cells, macrophages and cytotoxic T cells. Both virgin and memory T-lymphocytes ordinarily remain in the resting state, and in this state they do not exhibit significant helper or cytotoxic activity. When activated, these cells undergo several rounds of mitotic division to produce daughter cells. Some of these daughter cells return to the resting state as memory cells, but others become effector cells that actively express helper of cytotoxic activity. These daughter cells resemble their parents: CD4+ cells can only product CD4+ progeny, while CD8+ cells yield only CD8+ progeny. Effector T-cells express cell surface markers that are not expressed on resting T-cells, such as CD25, CD28, CD29, CD40L, transferrin receptors and class II MHC proteins. When the activating stimuli is withdrawn, cytotoxic or helper activity gradually subsides over a period of several days as the effector cells either die or revert to the resting state.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Similar to B-cell activation, T-lymphocyte responses to most antigens also require two types of simultaneous stimuli. The first is the antigen, which if appropriately displayed by MHC proteins on an antigen-presenting cell, can be recognized and bound by T-cell receptors. While this antigen-MHC complex does send a signal to the cell interior, it is usually insufficient to result in T-cell activation. Full activation, such as occurs with helper T-cells, requires costimulation with other specific ligands called costimulators that are expressed on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. Activation of a cytotoxic T cell, on the other hand, generally requires IL-2, a cytokine secreted by activated helper T cells.</p><p id="h-0008" num="0000">The Immune Response</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The three primary functional properties of the mammalian immune system distinguishing it from the other body's defenses include: (1) specificity&#x2014;the ability to recognize and respond or not to respond individually among a vast number of target molecules, (2) discrimination&#x2014;the ability to determine self from non-self so as to peacefully coexist with all the innumerable proteins and other organic material, yet still respond vigorously against foreign material that is introduced to the body, and (3) memory&#x2014;the ability to be molded by experience such that subsequent encounters with a particular foreign pathogen will provoke a more rapid and vigorous response than what occurred at the initial encounter. Because the IgE antagonists of the invention induce apoptosis in IgE-bearing B-cells, they are expected to attenuate or even erase immune memory to particular antigens. This is expected to be of particular benefit when vigorous immune response to common allergens is pathological, such as is the case with atopic disorders.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Virgin lymphocytes are continually released from the primary lymphoid organs into the periphery, each carrying surface receptors that enable antigen binding. Antigen binding in B cells is mediated through surface-bound immunoglobulins, whereas in T-cells it is mediated by T-cell receptors. When virgin lymphocytes are not activated, they die within a few days after entering the periphery. Those that are activated survive and proliferate, yielding daughter cells that may then undergo further cycles of activation and proliferation. The speed and intensity of response to a given antigen is determined largely by clonal selection: the larger the population daughter cells or clones specific to a particular antigen, the greater the number of cell that can recognize and participate in the immune response. Every immune response is complex and intricately regulated sequence of events involving several cell types. It is triggered when an immunogen enters the body and encounters a specialized class of cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These APCs capture a minute amount of the immunogen and display it in a form that can be recognized by antigen-specific helper T-lymphocytes. The helper T cells then become activated and, in turn, promote activation of other classes of lymphocytes, such as B cells or cytotoxic T cells. The activated lymphocytes then proliferate and carry out their specific effector functions. At each stage in this process, the lymphocytes and APCs communicate with one another through direct contact or by secreting regulatory cytokines.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Exogenous antigens that are captured by an APC undergo a series of alterations called antigen processing. Such processing, especially of proteinaceous immunogens involves denaturation and partial proteolytic digestions, so that the immunogen is cleaved into short peptides. A limited number of the resulting peptides then associated non-covalently with class II MHC proteins and are transported to the APC surface, a process known as antigen presentation. A CD4+ helper T lymphocyte that comes into direct contact with an APC may become activated, but it will do so only if it expressed a T-cell receptor protein that can recognize and bind the particular peptide-MHC complex presented by the APC.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Helper T (T<sub>H</sub>) cells are the principal orchestrators of the immune response because they are needed for activation of the two other lymphatic effector cells: cytotoxic T (Tc) cells and antibody secreting plasma cells. T<sub>H </sub>activation occurs early in an immune response and requires at least two signals. One signal is provided by binding of the T-cell antigen receptor to the antigenic peptide-MHC complex on the APC surface that is transmitted through the CD3 protein complex, while the second, costimulatory signal through the APC is thought to result from binding of a separate signal-transmitting protein on the T-cell surface with a specific ligand on the APC. One known such interaction is the T-cell protein CD28 and the family of APC surface proteins known as B7. Other surface proteins pairs may also mediate costimulation.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Together, the two signals induce the helper T cell to begin secreting a cytokine known as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and also to begin expressing specific high affinity IL-2 receptors on its surface. IL-2 is a highly potent mitogenic factor for T-lymphocytes and is essential for the proliferative response of activated T-cells. The effect of IL-2 on the cell from which it is secreted&#x2014;a phenomenon known as an autocrine effect. It has further been shown that even if a T-cell has received both signals, it will not proliferate if its own surface IL-2 receptors are blocked. IL-2 can also act on cells in the immediate vicinity, in a so-called paracrine effect. This effect is especially important to activate Tc cells, which generally do not produce enough IL-2 to stimulate their own proliferation. In addition to IL-2, activated T<sub>H </sub>cells secrete other cytokines and promote the growth, differentiation, and functions of B-cells, macrophages and other cell types.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The contact between and APC and an antigen-specific T<sub>H </sub>cell also has effect on the APC&#x2014;one of the most important of which is the release of IL-1. This cytokine is believed to act in an autocrine manner to increase surface expression of class II MHC proteins and of various adhesion molecules thereby strengthening binding of the T<sub>H </sub>cell and enhancing antigen presentation. At the same time, IL-1 functions in a paracrine manner on the T<sub>H </sub>cell to promote IL-2 secretion and IL-2 receptor expression.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">During activation of T<sub>H </sub>cells in the manner previously described, some B-cells may also have been engaging the immunogen through their antigen receptors, which are membrane-bound forms of the antibodies that they will later secrete. Unlike T-cells, B-cells recognize an immunogen in its free, unprocessed form. Specific antigen binding provides one type of signal that can lead to B-cell activation. A second type is provided by activated T<sub>H </sub>cells, which express proteins that help activate the B cell by binding to non-immunoglobulin receptors on its surface. These T<sub>H</sub>-derived signals, which act on any B cell regardless of its antigen specificity, are known as helper factors. These helper factors include IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6. However, help is more efficiently achieved through cell-cell contact, which allows proteins on the T-cell surface to directly contact those on the B cell. The most effect form of contact-mediated help occurs when a protein called CD40 ligand (CD40L), which is expressed on T<sub>H </sub>cells only after they become activated, binds to a protein called CD40 on B cells. In a process known as by-stander activation, contact with an activated B cell can even be sufficient to activate resting B cells even though its surface immunoglobulins have not engaged in antigen.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Tc lymphocytes function to eradicate cells that express foreign antigens on their surfaces, such as virus-infected host cells. Most Tc cells express CD8 rather than CD4 and hence recognize antigens in association with class I rather than class II MHC proteins. When a somatic cell is infected by a virus, some immunogenic viral proteins may undergo processing within the cell, and the resulting peptides may then appear as surface complexes with class I MHC molecules. These peptide-MHC complexes may then be recognized by the T-cell receptor of an antigen-specific clone, providing one of two signals necessary for Tc-cell activation. This first signal alone induces high-affinity IL-2 receptors on the Tc cell. The second signal is furnished by IL-2 secreted from a nearby activated T<sub>H </sub>lymphocyte. On receiving both signals, the activated Tc cell acquires cytotoxic activity, enabling it to kill the cell to which it is bound, as well as any other cells bearing the same peptide-MHC class I complexes. In some cases, killing occurs because the Tc releases specific toxins onto the target cell; in others, the Tc induces the target cell to commit suicide by apoptosis. The activate Tc cell also proliferates, giving rise to additional Tc cells with the same antigen specificity.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The IgE/Mast Cell/Mediatory Pathway.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">IgE antibodies are fixed to the surface of mast cells and basophils at the Fc portion of the molecule to a high affinity cell surface receptor, called Fc&#x3b5;RI. The allergic reaction is initiated when the polyvalent allergen molecule binds to antibodies that are occupying these receptors. The result is a bridging of the Fc&#x3b5;RI, which in turn signals intracellularly causing the release and activation of mediators of inflammation: histamine, leukotrienes, chemotactic factors, platelet-activating factor, and proteinases. These activated mediators act locally and cause increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, smooth muscle contraction and mucous gland secretion. Such events are termed clinically the immediate or early phase, and occur within the first 15-30 minutes following allergen exposure. Over the succeeding 12 hours there is progressive tissue infiltration of inflammatory cells, proceeding from neutrophils to eosinophils to mononuclear cells in response to other chemical mediators not quite fully understood. This period of time 6-12 hours after allergen exposure is designated the late phase and is characterized by clinical manifestations of cellular inflammation. Given that late phase reactions, especially in the lung occur in the absence of early phase reactions, there is still not entirely understood if the late phase reaction is necessarily IgE mediated.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">This mechanism is primarily responsible for the anaphylaxis, urticaria and the atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic gastroenteropathy.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The Effector T-Lymphocyte/Lymphokine Pathway</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Certain allergic diseases are mediated by allergen reaction with the effector T-lymphocyte sensitized to the specific allergen from a prior exposure. When allergen is encountered, CD4+ T-cells become activated to generate lymphokines, which results over the period of several days with the accumulation of mononuclear cell infiltrate.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">I. Definitions</heading><p id="p-0079" num="0078">An &#x201c;allergen&#x201d; or &#x201c;immunogen&#x201d; is any molecule that can trigger an immune response. As used herein, the term covers either the antigenic molecule itself, or its source, such as pollen grain, animal dander, insect venom or food product. This is contrasted with the term antigen, which refers to a molecule can be specifically recognized by an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Any foreign substance capable of inducing an immune response is a potential allergen. Many different chemicals of both natural and synthetic origin are known to be allergenic. Complex natural organic chemicals, especially proteins, are likely to cause antibody-mediated allergy, whereas simple organic compounds, inorganic chemicals, and metals more preferentially cause T-cell mediated allergy. In some cases, the same allergen may be responsible for more than one type of allergy. Exposure to the allergen may be through inhalation, injection, injection, or skin contact.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; includes monoclonal antibodies (including full length antibodies which have an immunoglobulin Fc region), antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies, diabodies, and single-chain molecules, as well as antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, and Fv). The term &#x201c;immunoglobulin&#x201d; (Ig) is used interchangeably with &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; herein.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. An IgM antibody consists of 5 of the basic heterotetramer units along with an additional polypeptide called a J chain, and contains 10 antigen binding sites, while IgA antibodies comprise from 2-5 of the basic 4-chain units which can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages in combination with the J chain. In the case of IgGs, the 4-chain unit is generally about 150,000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to an H chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (V<sub>H</sub>) followed by three constant domains (C<sub>H</sub>) for each of the &#x3b1; and &#x3b3; chains and four C<sub>H </sub>domains for &#x3bc; and &#x3b5; isotypes. Each L chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (V<sub>L</sub>) followed by a constant domain at its other end. The V<sub>L </sub>is aligned with the V<sub>H </sub>and the C<sub>L </sub>is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain (C<sub>H</sub>1). Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>together forms a single antigen-binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see e.g., <i>Basic and Clinical Immunology, </i>8th Edition, Daniel P. Sties, Abba I. Terr and Tristram G. Parsolw (eds), Appleton &#x26; Lange, Norwalk, Conn., 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains (CH), immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, having heavy chains designated &#x3b1;, &#x3b4;, &#x3b5;, &#x3b3; and &#x3bc;, respectively. The &#x3b3; and &#x3b1; classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor differences in the CH sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">An &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; antibody is one that has been identified, separated and/or recovered from a component of its production environment (E.g., naturally or recombinantly). Preferably, the isolated polypeptide is free of association with all other components from its production environment. Contaminant components of its production environment, such as that resulting from recombinant transfected cells, are materials that would typically interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified: (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method, and in some embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight; (1) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, an isolated polypeptide or antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The &#x201c;variable region&#x201d; or &#x201c;variable domain&#x201d; of an antibody refers to the amino-terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domains of the heavy chain and light chain may be referred to as &#x201c;VH&#x201d; and &#x201c;VL&#x201d;, respectively. These domains are generally the most variable parts of the antibody (relative to other antibodies of the same class) and contain the antigen binding sites.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The term &#x201c;variable&#x201d; refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen binding and defines the specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed across the entire span of the variable domains. Instead, it is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three HVRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the HVRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., <i>Sequences of Immunological Interest</i>, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in the binding of antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations and/or post-translation modifications (e.g., isomerizations, amidations) that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler and Milstein., <i>Nature, </i>256:495-97 (1975); Hongo et al., <i>Hybridoma, </i>14 (3): 253-260 (1995), Harlow et al., <i>Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual</i>, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2<sup>nd </sup>ed. 1988); Hammerling et al., in: <i>Monoclonal Antibodies and T</i>-<i>Cell Hybridomas </i>563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981)), recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat.

The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain (V<sub>H</sub>), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain (C<sub>H</sub>1). Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen-binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having different antigen-binding activity and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. Fab&#x2032; fragments differ from Fab fragments by having a few additional residues at the carboxy terminus of the C<sub>H</sub>1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab&#x2032;-SH is the designation herein for Fab&#x2032; in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab&#x2032; fragments which have hinge cysteines between them.

This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">&#x201c;Single-chain Fv&#x201d; also abbreviated as &#x201c;sFv&#x201d; or &#x201c;scFv&#x201d; are antibody fragments that comprise the VH and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of the sFv, see Pluckthun in <i>The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies</i>, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">&#x201c;Functional fragments&#x201d; of the antibodies of the invention comprise a portion of an intact antibody, generally including the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody or the F region of an antibody which retains or has modified FcR binding capability.

Bispecific diabodies are heterodimers of two &#x201c;crossover&#x201d; sFv fragments in which the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains of the two antibodies are present on different polypeptide chains.

In some instances, FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance, such as binding affinity. In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin sequence, and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence, although the FR regions may include one or more individual FR residue substitutions that improve antibody performance, such as binding affinity, isomerization, immunogenicity, etc. The number of these amino acid substitutions in the FR are typically no more than 6 in the H chain, and in the L chain, no more than 3. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.

The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc&#x3b3;RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc&#x3b3;RI, Fc&#x3b3;RII and Fc&#x3b3;RIII. Fc expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol. </i>9: 457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and natural killer (NK) cells.

The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during production or purification of the antibody, or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly, a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed, antibody populations with no K447 residues removed, and antibody populations having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.

Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, &#x201c;binding affinity&#x201d; refers to intrinsic binding affinity that reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity are described in the following.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In one embodiment, the &#x201c;Kd&#x201d; or &#x201c;Kd value&#x201d; according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen-binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution-binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (<sup>125</sup>I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g., Chen et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>293:865-881 (1999)). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (DYNEX Technologies, Inc.) are coated overnight with 5 &#x3bc;g/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23&#xb0; C.). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [<sup>125</sup>I]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., <i>Cancer Res. </i>57:4593-4599 (1997)). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% TWEEN-20&#x2122; surfactant in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 &#x3bc;l/well of scintillant (MICROSCINT-20&#x2122;; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT&#x2122; gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">According to another embodiment, the Kd is measured by using surface-plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE&#xae;-2000 or a BIACORE&#xae;-3000 instrument (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25&#xb0; C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at &#x2dc;10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N&#x2032;-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 &#x3bc;g/ml (&#x2dc;0.2 &#x3bc;M) before injection at a flow rate of 5 &#x3bc;l/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% TWEEN 20&#x2122; surfactant (PBST) at 25&#xb0; C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 &#x3bc;l/min. Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore&#xae; Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. See, e.g., Chen et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>293:865-881 (1999). If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>by the surface-plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence-emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25&#xb0; C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow-equipped spectrophotometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO&#x2122; spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">An &#x201c;on-rate,&#x201d; &#x201c;rate of association,&#x201d; &#x201c;association rate,&#x201d; or &#x201c;k<sub>on</sub>&#x201d; according to this invention can also be determined as described above using a BIACORE&#xae;-2000 or a BIACORE&#xae;-3000 system (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.).</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The phrase &#x201c;substantially reduced,&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially different,&#x201d; as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values (generally one associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference/comparator molecule) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values).

Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or MEGALIGN&#x2122; (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared.

Generally, &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites.

Structurally, the immunoadhesins comprise a fusion of an amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity which is other than the antigen recognition and binding site of an antibody (i.e., is &#x201c;heterologous&#x201d;), and an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence. The adhesin part of an immunoadhesin molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid sequence comprising at least the binding site of a receptor or a ligand. The immunoglobulin constant domain sequence in the immunoadhesin may be obtained from any immunoglobulin, such as IgG-1, IgG-2, IgG-3, or IgG-4 subtypes, IgA (including IgA-1 and IgA-2), IgE, IgD or IgM.

For rapid screening, the formulation may be kept at 40&#xb0; C. for 2 weeks to 1 month, at which time stability is measured. Where the formulation is to be stored at 2-8&#xb0; C., generally the formulation should be stable at 30&#xb0; C. or 40&#xb0; C. for at least 1 month and/or stable at 2-8&#xb0; C. for at least 2 years. Where the formulation is to be stored at 30&#xb0; C., generally the formulation should be stable for at least 2 years at 30&#xb0; C. and/or stable at 40&#xb0; C. for at least 6 months. For example, the extent of aggregation during storage can be used as an indicator of protein stability. Thus, a &#x201c;stable&#x201d; formulation may be one wherein less than about 10% and preferably less than about 5% of the protein are present as an aggregate in the formulation.

They include immunoadhesins comprising a portion of BR3, TACI or BCMA that binds BAFF, or variants thereof that bind BAFF. In other aspects, the BAFF antagonist is a BAFF antibody. A &#x201c;BAFF antibody&#x201d; is an antibody that binds BAFF, and preferably binds BAFF within a region of human BAFF comprising residues 162-275 of human BAFF. In another aspect, the BAFF antagonist is a BR3 antibody. A &#x201c;BR3 antibody&#x201d; is an antibody that binds BR3, and preferably binds BR3 within a region of human BR3 comprising residues 23-38 of human BR3. The sequences of human BAFF and human BR3 are found, e.g., in US 2006/0062787. Other examples of BAFF-binding polypeptides or BAFF antibodies can be found in, e.g., WO 2002/092620, WO 2003/014294, Gordon et al., <i>Biochemistry </i>42(20):5977-83 (2003), Kelley et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>279:16727-35 (2004), WO 1998/18921, WO 2001/12812, WO 2000/68378 and WO 2000/40716.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">&#x201c;Anti-IgE antibody&#x201d; includes any antibody that binds specifically to IgE in a manner so as to not induce cross-linking when IgE is bound to the high affinity receptor on mast cells and basophils. Exemplary antibodies include the antibodies of the invention as well as rhuMabE25 (E25, XOLAIR&#xae;), E26, E27, as well as CGP-5101 (Hu-901) and the HA antibody. The amino acid sequences of the heavy and light chain variable domains of the humanized anti-IgE antibodies E25, E26 and E27 are disclosed, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,213 and WO99/01556.

Modes for Carrying Out the Invention</heading><p id="p-0197" num="0196">A. Recombinant Preparation</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">The invention also provides an isolated nucleic acid encoding apoptotic anti-IgE antibodies, vectors and host cells comprising such nucleic acid, and recombinant techniques for the production of the antibody.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">For recombinant production of the antibody, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide proves that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following, a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, and enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">(1) Signal Sequence Component</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">The anti-IgE antibodies of this invention may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, which is preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the native mammalian signal sequence, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, lpp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, factor leader (including <i>Saccharomyces </i>and <i>Kluyveromyces</i>-factor leaders), or acid phosphatase leader, the <i>C. albicans </i>glucoamylase leader, or the signal described in WO 90/13646. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">The DNA for such precursor region is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the IgE binding antibody.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">(2) Origin of Replication</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally, in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA, and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2&#x3bc; plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter).</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">(3) Selection Gene Component</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the IgE binding antibody nucleic acid, such as DHFR, thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and -II, preferably primate metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">For example, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity (e.g., ATCC CRL-9096).</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">Alternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding IgE binding antibody, wild-type DHFR protein, and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3&#x2032;-phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,199.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 (Stinchcomb et al., <i>Nature, </i>282:39 (1979)). The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example, ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1. Jones, <i>Genetics, </i>85:12 (1977). The presence of the trp1 lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Similarly, Leu2-deficient yeast strains (ATCC 20,622 or 38,626) are complemented by known plasmids bearing the Leu2 gene.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">In addition, vectors derived from the 1.6 &#x3bc;m circular plasmid pKD1 can be used for transformation of <i>Kluyveromyces </i>yeasts. Alternatively, an expression system for large-scale production of recombinant calf chymosin was reported for <i>K. lactis</i>. Van den Berg, <i>Bio/Technology, </i>8:135 (1990). Stable multi-copy expression vectors for secretion of mature recombinant human serum albumin by industrial strains of <i>Kluyveromyces </i>have also been disclosed. Fleer et al., <i>Bio/Technology, </i>9:968-975 (1991).</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">(4) Promoter Component</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the IgE binding antibody. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter, -lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase promoter, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. However, other known bacterial promoters are suitable. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding the IgE binding antibody.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3&#x2032; end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3&#x2032; end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">Examples of suitable promoter sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phospho-fructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">Other yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73,657. Yeast enhancers also are advantageously used with yeast promoters.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">IgE binding antibody transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,978. See also Reyes et al., <i>Nature </i>297:598-601 (1982) on expression of human-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively, the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">(5) Enhancer Element Component</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">Transcription of a DNA encoding the IgE binding antibody of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, -fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv, <i>Nature </i>297:17-18 (1982) on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; to the IgE binding antibody-encoding sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5&#x2032; from the promoter.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">(6) Transcription Termination Component</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5&#x2032; and, occasionally 3&#x2032;, untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding IgE binding antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94/11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">(7) Selection and Transformation of Host Cells</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein are the prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryote cells described above. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for example, Enterobacteriaceae such as <i>Escherichia</i>, e.g., <i>E. coli, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella</i>, e.g., <i>Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia</i>, e.g., <i>Serratia marcescans</i>, and <i>Shigella</i>, as well as Bacilli such as <i>B. subtilis </i>and <i>B. licheniformis </i>(e.g., <i>B. licheniformis </i>41P disclosed in DD 266,710 published 12 Apr. 1989), <i>Pseudomonas </i>such as <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Streptomyces</i>. One preferred <i>E. coli </i>cloning host is <i>E. coli </i>294 (ATCC 31,446), although other strains such as <i>E. coli </i>B, <i>E. coli </i>X1776 (ATCC 31,537), and <i>E. coli </i>W3110 (ATCC 27,325) are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">Full length antibody, antibody fragments, and antibody fusion proteins can be produced in bacteria, in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed, such as when the therapeutic antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a toxin) and the immunoconjugate by itself shows effectiveness in tumor cell destruction. Full length antibodies have greater half life in circulation. Production in <i>E. coli </i>is faster and more cost efficient. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,237 (Carter et. al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,199 (Joly et al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,523 (Simmons et al.) which describes translation initiation region (TIR) and signal sequences for optimizing expression and secretion. After expression, the antibody is isolated from the <i>E. coli </i>cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be purified through, e.g., a protein A or G column depending on the isotype. Final purification can be carried out similar to the process for purifying antibody expressed e.g., in CHO cells.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for IgE binding antibody-encoding vectors. <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, or common baker's yeast, is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic host microorganisms. However, a number of other genera, species, and strains are commonly available and useful herein, such as <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe; Kluyveromyces </i>hosts such as, e.g., <i>K. lactis, K. fragilis </i>(ATCC 12,424), <i>K. bulgaricus </i>(ATCC 16,045), <i>K. wickeramii </i>(ATCC 24,178), <i>K. waltii </i>(ATCC 56,500), <i>K. drosophilarum </i>(ATCC 36,906), <i>K. thermotolerans</i>, and <i>K. marxianus; yarrowia </i>(EP 402,226); <i>Pichia pastoris </i>(EP 183,070); <i>Candida; Trichoderma reesia </i>(EP 244,234); <i>Neurospora crassa; Schwanniomyces </i>such as <i>Schwanniomyces occidentalis</i>; and filamentous fungi such as, e.g., <i>Neurospora, Penicillium, Tolypocladium</i>, and <i>Aspergillus </i>hosts such as <i>A. nidulans </i>and <i>A. niger. </i></p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated IgE binding antibody are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as <i>Spodoptera frugiperda </i>(caterpillar), <i>Aedes aegypti </i>(mosquito), <i>Aedes albopictus </i>(mosquito), <i>Drosophila melanogaster </i>(fruitfly), and <i>Bombyx mori </i>have been identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available, e.g., the L-1 variant of <i>Autographa californica </i>NPV and the Bm-5 strain of <i>Bombyx mori </i>NPV, and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention, particularly for transfection of <i>Spodoptera frugiperda </i>cells.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">Plant cell cultures of cotton, corn, potato, soybean, petunia, tomato, and tobacco can also be utilized as hosts.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">However, interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells, and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., <i>J. Gen. Virol. </i>36:59 (1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/&#x2212;DHFR (CHO, Urlaub et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>77:4216 (1980)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, <i>Biol.

Acad. Sci. </i>383:44-68 (1982)); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma line (Hep G2).</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">Host cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for IgE binding antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">(8) Culturing the Host Cells</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">The host cells used to produce the IgE binding antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in Ham et al., <i>Meth. Enz. </i>58:44 (1979), Barnes et al., <i>Anal. Biochem. </i>102:255 (1980), U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; 4,560,655; or 5,122,469; WO 90/03430; WO 87/00195; or U.S. Pat. Re. No. 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN&#x2122; drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">(9) Purification of Antibody</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, are removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al., <i>Bio/Technology </i>10: 163-167 (1992) describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of <i>E. coli</i>. Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1, 2, or 4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al., <i>J. Immunol. Meth. </i>62:1-13 (1983)). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 (Guss et al., <i>EMBO J. </i>5:15671575 (1986)). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrene-divinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a C<sub>H</sub>3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX&#x2122; resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE&#x2122; chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">Following any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">B. Antibody Preparation</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">1) Polyclonal Antibodies</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">Polyclonal antibodies are generally raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, e.g., keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor, using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent, e.g., maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysien residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride, SOCl<sub>2</sub>, or R<sup>1</sup>N&#x2550;C&#x2550;NR, where R and R<sup>1 </sup>are independently lower alkyl groups. Examples of adjuvants which may be employed include Freund's complete adjuvant and MPL-TDM adjuvant (monophosphoryl Lipid A, synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate). The immunization protocol may be selected by one skilled in the art without undue experimentation.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">The animals are immunized against the antigen, immunogenic conjugates, or derivatives by combining, e.g., 100 &#x3bc;g or 5 &#x3bc;g or the protein or conjugate (for rabbits or mice, respectively) with 3 volumes of Freund's complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later, the animals are boosted with &#x2155; to 1/10 the original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund's complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to fourteen days later, the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also, aggregating agents such as alum are suitable to enhance the immune response.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">2) Monoclonal Antibodies</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">Monoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations and/or post-translational modifications (e.g., isomerizations, amidations) that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">For example, the monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., <i>Nature, </i>256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567).</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">In the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized as hereinabove described to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, <i>Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice</i>, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986).</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">The immunizing agent will typically include the antigenic protein or a fusion variant thereof. Generally either peripheral blood lymphocytes (&#x201c;PBLs&#x201d;) are used if cells of human origin are desired, or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non-human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphoctyes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell. Goding, <i>Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice</i>, Academic Press (1986), pp. 59-103.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, bovine and human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which are substances that prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">Preferred immortalized myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 cells (and derivatives thereof, e.g., X63-Ag8-653) available from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, <i>J. Immunol., </i>133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., <i>Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications</i>, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the desired antigen. Preferably, the binding affinity and specificity of the monoclonal antibody can be determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the in art. For example, binding affinity may be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al., <i>Anal. Biochem., </i>107:220 (1980).</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, supra). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as tumors in a mammal.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">Monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567, and as described above. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as <i>E. coli </i>cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, in order to synthesize monoclonal antibodies in such recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al., <i>Curr. Opinion in Immunol., </i>5:256-262 (1993) and Pl&#xfc;ckthun, <i>Immunol. Revs. </i>130:151-188 (1992).</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">In a further embodiment, antibodies can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al., <i>Nature, </i>348:552-554 (1990). Clackson et al., <i>Nature, </i>352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>222:581-597 (1991) describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies, respectively, using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity (nM range) human antibodies by chain shuffling (Marks et al., <i>Bio/Technology, </i>10:779-783 (1992)), as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries (Waterhouse et al., <i>Nucl. Acids Res., </i>21:2265-2266 (1993)). Thus, these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254">The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy- and light-chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison, et al., <i>Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, </i>81:6851 (1984)), or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Typically such non-immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant domains of an antibody, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different antigen.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255">The monoclonal antibodies described herein may by monovalent, the preparation of which is well known in the art. For example, one method involves recombinant expression of immunoglobulin light chain and a modified heavy chain. The heavy chain is truncated generally at any point in the Fc region so as to prevent heavy chain crosslinking. Alternatively, the relevant cysteine residues may be substituted with another amino acid residue or are deleted so as to prevent crosslinking. In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibodies to produce fragments thereof, particularly Fab fragments, can be accomplished using routine techniques known in the art.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256">Chimeric or hybrid antibodies also may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide-exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">3) Humanized Antibodies.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0258">The antibodies of the invention may further comprise humanized or human antibodies. Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementarity determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domain, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Jones et al., <i>Nature </i>321: 522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., <i>Nature </i>332: 323-329 (1988) and Presta, <i>Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. </i>2: 593-596 (1992).</p><p id="p-0260" num="0259">Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as &#x201c;import&#x201d; residues, which are typically taken from an &#x201c;import&#x201d; variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers, Jones et al., <i>Nature </i>321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., <i>Nature </i>332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., <i>Science </i>239:1534-1536 (1988), or through substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0260">The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called &#x201c;best-fit&#x201d; method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework (FR) for the humanized antibody. Sims et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>151:2296 (1993); Chothia et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>196:901 (1987). Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies. Carter et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>151:2623 (1993).</p><p id="p-0262" num="0261">It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0262">Various forms of the humanized antibody are contemplated. For example, the humanized antibody may be an antibody fragment, such as an Fab, which is optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent(s) in order to generate an immunoconjugate. Alternatively, the humanized antibody may be an intact antibody, such as an intact IgG1 antibody.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0263">4) Human Antibodies</p><p id="p-0265" num="0264">As an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated. For example, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (J<sub>H</sub>) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., <i>Nature, </i>362:255-258 (1993); Bruggermann et al., <i>Year in Immuno., </i>7:33 (1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,669 and WO 97/17852.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0265">Alternatively, phage display technology can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. McCafferty et al., <i>Nature </i>348:552-553 (1990); Hoogenboom and Winter, <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>227: 381 (1991). According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats, reviewed in, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S, and Chiswell, David J., <i>Curr. Opin Struct. Biol. </i>3:564-571 (1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al., Nature 352:624-628 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597 (1991), or Griffith et al., EMBO J. 12:725-734 (1993). See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,332 and 5,573,905.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0266">The techniques of Cole et al., and Boerner et al., are also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985) and Boerner et al., <i>J. Immunol. </i>147(1): 86-95 (1991). Similarly, human antibodies can be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon challenge, human antibody production is observed, which closely resembles that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly and antibody repertoire. This approach is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806, 5,569,825, 5,625,126, 5,633,425, 5,661,016 and in the following scientific publications: Marks et al., <i>Bio/Technology </i>10: 779-783 (1992); Lonberg et al., <i>Nature </i>368: 856-859 (1994); Morrison, <i>Nature </i>368: 812-13 (1994), Fishwild et al., <i>Nature Biotechnology </i>14: 845-51 (1996), Neuberger, <i>Nature Biotechnology </i>14: 826 (1996) and Lonberg and Huszar, <i>Intern. Rev. Immunol. </i>13: 65-93 (1995).</p><p id="p-0268" num="0267">Finally, human antibodies may also be generated in vitro by activated B cells (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,567,610 and 5,229,275).</p><p id="p-0269" num="0268">5) Antibody Fragments</p><p id="p-0270" num="0269">In certain circumstances there are advantages to using antibody fragments, rather than whole antibodies. Smaller fragment sizes allow for rapid clearance, and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0270">Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., <i>J Biochem Biophys. Method. </i>24:107-117 (1992); and Brennan et al., <i>Science </i>229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and scFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from <i>E. coli</i>, thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab&#x2032;-SH fragments can be directly recovered from <i>E. coli </i>and chemically coupled to form F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments (Carter et al., <i>Bio/Technology </i>10:163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>with increase in vivo half-life is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,046. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See WO 93/16185; U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,894 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,458. The antibody fragment may also be a &#x201c;linear antibody&#x201d;, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870.

Alternatively, antibodies with enzymatic activity, also known in the art as &#x201c;abzymes&#x201d; can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs (see, e.g., Massey, <i>Nature </i>328: 457-458 (1987)).

Alternatively, fusion proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region of the antibody of the invention linked to at least a functionally active portion of an enzyme of the invention can be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art (see, e.g. Neuberger et al., <i>Nature </i>312: 604-608 (1984)).</p><p id="p-0277" num="0276">7) Bispecific and Polyspecific Antibodies</p><p id="p-0278" num="0277">Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes, including those on the same or another protein. Alternatively, one arm can be armed to bind to the target antigen, and another arm can be combined with an arm that binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g., CD3), or Fc receptors for IgG (Fc&#x3b3;R) such as Fc&#x3b3;R1 (CD64), Fc&#x3b3;RII (CD32) and Fc&#x3b3;RIII (CD16), so as to focus and localize cellular defense mechanisms to the target antigen-expressing cell. Such antibodies can be derived from full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>bispecific antibodies).</p><p id="p-0279" num="0278">Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express the target antigen. Such antibodies possess one arm that binds the desired antigen and another arm that binds the cytotoxic agent (e.g., saporin, anti-interferon-a, vinca alkoloid, ricin A chain, methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten). Examples of known bispecific antibodies include anti-ErbB2/anti-FcgRIII (WO 96/16673), anti-ErbB2/anti-FcgRI (U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,234), anti-ErbB2/anti-CD3 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337).</p><p id="p-0280" num="0279">Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy-chain/light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities. Millstein et al., <i>Nature, </i>305:537-539 (1983). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829 and in Traunecker et al., <i>EMBO J., </i>10:3655-3659 (1991).</p><p id="p-0281" num="0280">According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0281">In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecules provides for an easy way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94/04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies, see, for example, Suresh et al., <i>Methods in Enzymology </i>121: 210 (1986).</p><p id="p-0283" num="0282">According to another approach described in WO 96/27011 or U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the CH3 region of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g., tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory &#x201c;cavities&#x201d; of identical or similar size to the large side chains(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g., alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0283">Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., <i>Science </i>229: 81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab&#x2032; fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab&#x2032;-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab&#x2032;-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0284">Fab&#x2032; fragments may be directly recovered from <i>E. coli </i>and chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>175: 217-225 (1992) describes the production of fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>molecules. Each Fab&#x2032; fragment was separately secreted from <i>E. coli </i>and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0285">Various techniques for making and isolating bivalent antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bivalent heterodimers have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab&#x2032; portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. The &#x201c;diabody&#x201d; technology described by Hollinger et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>90: 6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific/bivalent antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (V<sub>H</sub>) connected to a light-chain variable domain (V<sub>L</sub>) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary V<sub>L </sub>and V<sub>H </sub>domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific/bivalent antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>152:5368 (1994).</p><p id="p-0287" num="0286">Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al., <i>J. Immunol. </i>147: 60 (1991).</p><p id="p-0288" num="0287">Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes on a given molecule. Alternatively, an anti-protein arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g., CD2, CD3, CD28 or B7), or Fc receptors for IgG (Fc&#x3b3;R), such as Fc&#x3b3;RI (CD64), Fc&#x3b3;RII (CD32) and Fc&#x3b3;RIII (CD16) so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the cell expressing the particular protein. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express a particular protein. Such antibodies possess a protein-binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent or a radionuclide chelator, such as EOTUBE, DPTA, DOTA or TETA. Another bispecific antibody of interest binds the protein of interest and further binds tissue factor (TF).</p><p id="p-0289" num="0288">8) Multivalent Antibodies</p><p id="p-0290" num="0289">A multivalent antibody may be internalized (and/or catabolized) faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies (which are other than of the IgM class) with three or more antigen binding sites (e.g. tetravalent antibodies), which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises (or consists of) an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario, the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino-terminal to the Fc region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises (or consists of) three to about eight, but preferably four, antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain (and preferably two polypeptide chains), wherein the polypeptide chain(s) comprise two or more variable domains. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise VD1-(X1)<sub>n</sub>-VD2-(X2)<sub>n</sub>-Fc, wherein VD1 is a first variable domain, VD2 is a second variable domain, Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region, X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide, and n is 0 or 1. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise: VH-CH1-flexible linker-VH-CH1-Fc region chain; or VH-CH1-VH-CH1-Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least two (and preferably four) light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may, for instance, comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and, optionally, further comprise a CL domain.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0290">9) Heteroconjugate Antibodies</p><p id="p-0292" num="0291">Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells, U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, and for treatment of HIV infection. WO 91/00360, WO 92/200373 and EP 0308936. It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980. Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0292">10) Effector Function Engineering</p><p id="p-0294" num="0293">It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function, e.g., so as to enhance antigen-dependent cell-mediated cyotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally, cysteine residue(s) may be introduced in the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and/or increased complement-mediated cell killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). See Caron et al., <i>J. Exp Med. </i>176:1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, B. <i>J. Immunol. </i>148:2918-2922 (1992). Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al., <i>Cancer Research </i>53:2560-2565 (1993). Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities.

No. 5,739,277, for example. As used herein, the term &#x201c;salvage receptor binding epitope&#x201d; refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgG<sub>1</sub>, IgG<sub>2</sub>, IgG<sub>3</sub>, or IgG<sub>4</sub>) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0295">11) Immunoconjugates</p><p id="p-0297" num="0296">The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates or antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate).

Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies (Rowland et al., <i>Cancer Immunol. Immunother. </i>21:183-87 (1986)). Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and vindesine. Toxins used in antibody-toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, plant toxins such as ricin, small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin (Mandler et al. <i>J. Nat.

In one embodiment, the full length antibody or antigen binding fragments thereof can be conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules (e.g., about 1 to about 10 maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule). Maytansinoids are mitotic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansinoids, isolated from natural sources or prepared synthetically, including maytansine, maytansinal and derivatives and analogues thereof have been described, see e.g., U.S. Pat.

Methods of preparing antibody-maytansinoid conjugates are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020. In a preferred embodiment, a maytansinoid is linked to the antibody via a disulfide or other sulfur-containing linker group. Maytansine may, for example, be converted to May-SS-Me, which may be reduced to May-SH3 and reacted with modified antibody to generate a maytansinoid-antibody immunoconjugate. Chari et al., <i>Cancer Res. </i>52: 127-131 (1992). The antibody can be modified by known methods and the antibody containing free or protected thiol groups is then reacted with a disulfide containing maytansinoid to produce the conjugate.

Other anti-tumor drugs that the antibody can be conjugated to include QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of actions and do not readily cross the plasma membrane.

Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; and (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles.

For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody nucleic acid, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0317">A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called &#x201c;alanine scanning mutagenesis&#x201d; as described by Cunningham and Wells in <i>Science, </i>244:1081-1085 (1989). Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0318">Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0319">Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in the Table A below under the heading of &#x201c;preferred substitutions&#x201d;. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated &#x201c;exemplary substitutions&#x201d; in Table A, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0320"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE A</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Amino Acid Substitutions</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Exemplary</entry><entry>Preferred</entry></row><row><entry>Original Residue</entry><entry>Substitutions</entry><entry>Substitutions</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Ala (A)</entry><entry>val; leu; ile</entry><entry>val</entry></row><row><entry>Arg (R)</entry><entry>lys; gln; asn</entry><entry>lys</entry></row><row><entry>Asn (N)</entry><entry>gln; his; asp, lys; arg</entry><entry>gln</entry></row><row><entry>Asp (D)</entry><entry>glu; asn</entry><entry>glu</entry></row><row><entry>Cys (C)</entry><entry>ser; ala</entry><entry>ser</entry></row><row><entry>Gln (Q)</entry><entry>asn; glu</entry><entry>asn</entry></row><row><entry>Glu (E)</entry><entry>asp, gln</entry><entry>asp</entry></row><row><entry>Gly (G)</entry><entry>ala</entry><entry>ala</entry></row><row><entry>His (H)</entry><entry>asn; gln; lys; arg</entry><entry>arg</entry></row><row><entry>Ile (I)</entry><entry>leu; val; met; ala; phe; norleucine</entry><entry>leu</entry></row><row><entry>Leu (L)</entry><entry>norleucine; ile; val; met; ala; phe</entry><entry>ile</entry></row><row><entry>Lys (K)</entry><entry>arg; gln; asn</entry><entry>arg</entry></row><row><entry>Met (M)</entry><entry>leu; phe; ile</entry><entry>leu</entry></row><row><entry>Phe (F)</entry><entry>leu; val; ile; ala; tyr</entry><entry>tyr</entry></row><row><entry>Pro (P)</entry><entry>Ala</entry><entry>ala</entry></row><row><entry>Ser (S)</entry><entry>Thr</entry><entry>thr</entry></row><row><entry>Thr (T)</entry><entry>Ser</entry><entry>ser</entry></row><row><entry>Trp (W)</entry><entry>tyr; phe</entry><entry>tyr</entry></row><row><entry>Tyr (Y)</entry><entry>trp; phe; thr; ser</entry><entry>phe</entry></row><row><entry>Val (V)</entry><entry>ile; leu; met; phe; ala; norleucine</entry><entry>leu</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0322" num="0321">Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:</p><p id="p-0323" num="0322">(1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile;</p><p id="p-0324" num="0323">(2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr;</p><p id="p-0325" num="0324">(3) acidic: asp, glu;</p><p id="p-0326" num="0325">(4) basic: asn, gln, his, lys, arg;</p><p id="p-0327" num="0326">(5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and</p><p id="p-0328" num="0327">(6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0328">Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0329">Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment).</p><p id="p-0331" num="0330">A particularly preferred type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (e.g. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g. binding affinity) as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and IgE. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0331">Another type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original glycosylation pattern of the antibody. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0332">Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0333">Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).</p><p id="p-0335" num="0334">Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the anti-IgE antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the anti-IgE antibody.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0335">13) Other Antibody Modifications</p><p id="p-0337" num="0336">The antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably, the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water-soluble polymers. Non-limiting examples of water-soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol homopolymers, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one polymer is attached, they can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and/or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions, etc. Such techniques and other suitable formulations are disclosed in <i>Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, </i>20th Ed., Alfonso Gennaro, Ed., Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science (2000).</p><p id="p-0338" num="0337">C.

When used with large, charged biomolecules such as proteins and antibodies, they are often termed &#x201c;stabilizers&#x201d; because they can interact with the charged groups of the amino acid side chains, thereby lessening the potential for inter and intra-molecular interactions. Tonicity agents can be present in any amount between 0.1% to 25% by weight, preferably 1 to 5%, taking into account the relative amounts of the other ingredients. Preferred tonicity agents include polyhydric sugar alcohols, preferably trihydric or higher sugar alcohols, such as glycerin, erythritol, arabitol, xylitol, sorbitol and mannitol.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0343">Additional excipients include agents which can serve as one or more of the following: (1) bulking agents, (2) solubility enhancers, (3) stabilizers and (4) and agents preventing denaturation or adherence to the container wall.

Methods of Treatment:</p><p id="p-0355" num="0354">For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an active agent, will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the agent is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the agent, and the discretion of the attending physician. The agent is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0355">A preferred method of treatment is the treatment of IgE-mediated disorders. IgE mediated disorders includes atopic disorders, which are characterized by an inherited propensity to respond immunologically to many common naturally occurring inhaled and ingested antigens and the continual production of IgE antibodies. Specific atopic disorders include allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and allergic gastroenteropathy. Atopic patients often have multiple allergies, meaning that they have IgE antibodies to, and symptoms from, many environmental allergens, including pollens, fungi (e.g., molds), animal and insect debris and certain foods.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0356">However disorders associated with elevated IgE levels are not limited to those with an inherited (atopic) etiology. Other disorders associated with elevated IgE levels, that appear to be IgE-mediated and are treatable with the formulations of this present invention include hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic hypersensitivity), eczema, urticaria, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, parasitic diseases, hyper-IgE syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, thymic alymphoplasia, IgE myeloma and graft-versus-host reaction.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0357">Allergic rhinitis, also known as allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or hay fever, is the most common manifestation of an atopic reaction to inhaled allergens, the severity and duration of which is often correlative with the intensity and length of exposure to the allergen. It is a chronic disease, which may first appear at any age, but the onset is usually during childhood or adolescence. A typical attack consists of profuse watery rhinorrhea, paroxysmal sneezing, nasal obstruction and itching of the nose and palate. Postnasal mucus drainage also causes sore throat, throat clearing and cough. There can also be symptoms of allergic blepharoconjunctivitis, with intense itching of the conjunctivae and eyelids, redness, tearing, and photophobia. Severe attacks are often accompanied by systemic malaise, weakness, fatigue, and sometimes, muscle soreness after intense periods of sneezing.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0358">Asthma, also known as reversible obstructive airway disease, is characterized by hyperresponsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree to respiratory irritants and bronchoconstrictor chemicals, producing attacks of wheezing, dyspnea, chest tightness, and cough that are reversible spontaneously or with treatment. It is a chronic disease involving the entire airway, but varies in severity from occasional mild transient episodes to severe, chronic, life-threatening bronchial obstruction. Asthma and atopy may coexist, but only about half of asthmatics are also atopic, and an even smaller percentage of atopic patients also have asthma. However, atopy and asthma are not entirely independent in that asthma occurs more frequently among atopic than amongst nonatopic individuals, especially during childhood. Asthma has further been historically broken down into two subgroups, extrinsic asthma and intrinsic asthma.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0359">Extrinsic asthma, also known as allergic, atopic or immunologic asthma, is descriptive of patients that generally develop asthma early in life, usually during infancy or childhood. Other manifestations of atopy, including eczema or allergic rhinitis often coexist. Asthmatic attacks can occur during pollen seasons, in the presence of animals, or on exposure to house dust, feather pillows, or other allergens. Skin tests show positive wheal-and-flare reactions to the causative allergens. Interestingly, total serum IgE concentrations are frequently elevated, but are sometimes normal.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0360">Intrinsic asthma, also known as nonallergic or idopathic asthma, typically first occurs during adult life, after an apparent respiratory infection. Symptoms include chronic or recurrent bronchial obstruction unrelated to pollen seasons or exposure to other allergens. Skin tests are negative to the usual atopic allergens, serum IgE concentration is normal. Additional symptoms include sputum blood and eosinophilia. Other schemes for classifying asthma into subgroups, like aspirin-sensitive, exercise-induced, infectious and psychologic merely define external triggering factors that affect certain patients more so than others.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0361">Finally, it is important to note that while some classifications have historically associated only allergic asthma with IgE dependency, there is now strong statistically significant data showing a correlation between IgE and asthma (both allergic and non-allergic). Chapter 27, &#x201c;The Atopic Diseases&#x201d;, A. I. Terr in Medical Immunology, 9th Ed., Simon and Schuster, Stites et al., Ed. (1997). As a result, the term &#x201c;IgE-mediated disorders&#x201d;, for purposes of this patent application, includes both allergic and non-allergic asthma.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0362">Physical signs of an asthma attack include tachypnea, audible wheezing, and use of the accessory muscles of respiration. Rapid pulse and elevated blood pressure are also typically present, as are elevated levels of eosinophils in the peripheral blood and nasal secretions. Pulmonary functions show a decrease in flow rates and 1 second forced expiratory volume (FEV<sub>1</sub>). The total lung capacity and functional residual capacity are typically normal or slightly increased, but may be decreased with extreme bronchospasm.</p><p id="p-0364" num="0363">The pathology of asthma can be distinguished by early phase and late phase reactions. The early phase is characterized by smooth muscle contraction, edema and hypersecretion, while the late phase reactions are characterized by cellular inflammation. Asthma can be induced by various non-specific triggers including infections (e.g., viral respiratory infections), physiologic factors (e.g., exercise, hyperventilation, deep breathing, psychologic factors), atmospheric factors (e.g., sulfur dioxide, ammonia, cold air, ozone, distilled water vapor), ingestants (e.g., propranolol, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), experimental inhalants (e.g., hypertonic solutions, citric acid, histamine, methacholine, prostaglandin F<sub>2&#x3b1;</sub>) and occupational inhalants (e.g., isocyanates). Various additional occupational or environmental allergens that cause allergic asthma can include animal products, insect dusts, sea creatures, plant products, fruits, seeds, leaves and pollens, organic dyes and inks, microbial agents, enzymes, therapeutic agents, sterilizing agents, and inorganic and organic chemicals.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0364">Atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, neurodermatitis, atopic eczema or Besnier's prurigo, is common chronic skin disorder specific to a subset of patients with the familial and immunologic features of atopy. The essential feature is a pruritic dermal inflammatory response, which induces a characteristic symmetrically distributed skin eruption with predilection for certain sites. There is also frequent overproduction of IgE by B lymphocytes. While atopic dermatitis is classified as a cutaneous form of atopy because it is associated with allergic rhinitis and asthma and high IgE levels, the severity of the dermatitis, however, does not always correlate with exposure to allergens on skin testing, and desensitization (unlike other allergic diseases) is not effective treatment. While high serum IgE is confirmatory of a diagnosis of allergic asthma, normal levels do not preclude it. Onset of the disease can occur at any age, and lesions begin acutely with erythematosus edematous papule or plaque with scaling. Itching leads to weeping and crusting, then to chronic lichenification. On the cellular level, acute lesion is edemous and the dermis is infiltrated with mononuclear cells, CD4 lymphocytes. Neutrophils, eosinophils, plasma cells and basophils are rare, but degranulated mast cells are present. Chronic lesions feature epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis, and the dermis is infiltrated with mononuclear cells, Langerhans' cells and mast cells. There may also be focal areas of fibrosis, including involvement of the perineurium of small nerves.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0365">Allergic gastroenteropathy, also known as eosinophilic gastroenteropathy, is an unusual atopic manifestation in which multiple IgE food sensitivities are associated with a local gastrointestinal tract mucosal reaction. It is rare in adults, but more common, but transient, in infants. The condition results when ingested food allergens react with local IgE antibodies in the jejunal mucosa liberate mast cell mediators, resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms shortly after the meal. Continued exposure produced chronic inflammation, resulting in gastrointestinal protein loss and hypoproteinemic edema. Blood loss through the inflamed intestinal mucosa may be significant enough to cause iron deficiency anemia. The allergic reaction occurs locally in the upper gastrointestinal mucosa following allergen exposure, but resolves with allergen avoidance.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0366">Anaphylaxis and urticaria are clearly IgE-mediated, but they lack genetic determinants, and have no predilection for atopic individuals. Anaphylaxis is an acute, generalized allergic reaction with simultaneous involvement of several organ systems, usually cardiovascular, respiratory, cutaneous and gastrointestinal. The reaction is immunologically mediated, and it occurs on exposure to an allergen to which the subject has been previously sensitized. Urticaria and angioedema refers to the physical swelling, erythema and itching resulting from histamine stimulated receptor in superficial cutaneous blood vessels, and is the hallmark cutaneous feature of systemic anaphylaxis. Systemic anaphylaxis is the occurrence of an IgE-mediated reaction simultaneously in multiple organs resulting from drug, insect venom or food. It is caused suddenly by allergen induced, mast cell loaded IgE, resulting in profound and life-threatening alteration in the functioning of various vital organs. Vascular collapse, acute airway obstruction, cutaneous vasodilation and edema, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary muscle spasm occur almost simultaneously, although not always to the same degree.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0367">The pathology of anaphylaxis includes angioedema and hyperinflated lungs, with mucous plugging of airways and focal atelectasis. On a cellular level, the lungs appear similarly as during an acute asthma attack, with hypersecretion of bronchial submucosal glands, mucosal and submucosal edema, peribronchial vascular congestion and eosinophilia in the bronchial walls. Pulmonary edema and hemorrhage may be present. Bronchial muscle spasm, hyperinflation, and even rupture of alveoli may also be present. Important features of human anaphylaxis include edema, vascular congestion, and eosinophilia in the lamina propria of the larynx, trachea, epiglottis and hypopharynx.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0368">Exposure to the allergen may be through ingestion, injection, inhalation or contact with skin or mucous membrane. The reaction begins within seconds or minutes after exposure to the allergen. There may be an initial fright or sense of impending doom, followed rapidly by symptoms in one or more target organ systems: cardiovascular, respiratory, cutaneous or gastrointestinal.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0369">The allergens responsible for anaphylaxis differ from those commonly associated with atopy. Foods, drugs, insect venoms or latex are the common sources. Food allergens includes those found in crustaceans, mollusks (e.g., lobster, shrimp, crab), fish, legumes (e.g., peanuts, peas, beans, licorice), seeds (e.g. sesame, cottonseed, caraway, mustard, flaxseed, sunflower), nuts, berries, egg whites, buckwheat and milk. Drug allergens include those found in heterologous proteins and polypeptides, polysaccharides and haptenic drugs. Insect allergens include <i>Hymenoptera </i>insects, including the honeybee, yellow jacket, hornet, wasp and fire ant.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0370">While epinephrine is the typical treatment for anaphylaxis, antihistamine or other histamine blockers are typically prescribed for less severe urticaria or angioedemic reaction.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0371">E. Combination Therapies</p><p id="p-0373" num="0372">The method of the invention can be combined with known methods of treatment for IgE-mediated disorder, either as combined or additional treatment steps or as additional components of a therapeutic formulation.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0373">For example, antihistamines, especially non-sedating antihistamines may be administered before, prior to, or commensurate with the anti-IgE antibodies of the invention. Suitable antihistamines include those of the alkylamine (e.g., chlorpheniramine), ethanolamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) and phenothiazine (e.g., promethazine). While many antihistamines antagonize the pharmacological effects of histamine by blocking its receptor sites on the effector cells, other common antihistamine drugs operate by blocking histamine release from mast cells that have been sensitized and armed with allergen-specific IgE (e.g., cromolyn sodium). Example antihistamines include astemizole, azatadine maleate, bropheniramine maleate, carbinoxamine maleate, cetirizine hydrochloride, clemastine fumarate, cyproheptadine hydrochloride, dexbrompheniramine maleate, dexchlorpheniramine maleate, dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, doxylamine succinate, fexofendadine hydrochloride, terphenadine hydrochloride, hydroxyzine hydrochloride, loratidine, meclizine hydrochloride, tripelannamine citrate, tripelennamine hydrochloride, triprolidine hydrochloride.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0374">Particular symptoms of IgE-mediated disorders (e.g., early phase reactions) can be ameliorated with sympathomimetics or drugs having bronchodialator effect. Epinephrine is a broad acting alpha and beta-adrenergic often administered subcutaneously in a dose of 0.2-0.5 mL of 1:100 aqueous solution. A longer acting form of epinephrine (i.e., terbutaline) in 1:200 suspension is also used when a longer duration effect is desired. Suitable additional beta-adrenergics include albuterol, pirbuterol, metaproterenol, salmeterol, isoetharine and formeterol for administration nasally (e.g., hand-held nebulizer, intermittent positive-pressure breathing device, or metered-dose pressurized inhalers) or orally.</p><p id="p-0376" num="0375">Bronchodilation can also be achieved through administration of xanthines, especially when they are administered in combination with the above sympathomimetic drugs. Example xanthines include aminophylline (iv. 250-500 mg) and theophylline (oral, 10-20 &#x3bc;g/ml serum concentration).</p><p id="p-0377" num="0376">Other symptoms from various IgE-mediated disorders (e.g., late phase reactions) can be attenuated by treatment with glucocorticoids or other drugs having anti-inflammatory effects. Prednisone (30-60 mg daily) is administered systemically for severe attacks, while beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide and flunisolide are administered in aerosolized form as long-term maintenance therapy. Additional corticosteroids that have anti-inflammatory effects include: betamethasone, budesonide, dexamethasone, fludrocortisone acetate, flunisolide, fluticasone propionate, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, prednisone, triamcinolone.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0377">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may also be used in combination with the therapeutic methods of the invention include, acetaminophen, aspirin, bromfenac sodium, diclofenac sodium, diflunisal, etodolac, fenoprofen calcium, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, ketoprofen, meclofenamate sodium, mefenamic acid, nabumetone, naproxen, naproxen sodium, oxyphenbutazone, phenylbutzone, piroxicam, sulindac, tolmetin sodium.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0378">Additionally, the maximum therapeutic benefit may also be achieved with the administration of decongestants (e.g., phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephadrin), cough suppressants (e.g., dextromethorphan, codeine, or hydrocodone) or analgesic (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin).</p><p id="p-0380" num="0379">Allergen desensitization is a treatment form in which allergens are injected into the patient for the purpose or reducing or eliminating the allergic response. It is also known as allergen immunotherapy, hyposensitization or allergy injection therapy. It is often used in combination with other allergy treatments, but not often as a primary treatment. It has been successfully employed when allergen avoidance is impossible. A typical allergen desensitization treatment incorporates subcutaneous injection of sterile allergen in increasing doses once or twice a week until a dose is achieved that produces a transient small local area of inflammation at the injection site. The dose is then given on a maintenance schedule once every 2-4 weeks. Allergic desensitization is most often used in the treatment of allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis, although it has had success in treating anaphylaxis. Desensitization has also been effectively used through the use of adjuvants, such as incomplete Freund's adjuvant, which is an emulsion of aqueous antigen in mineral oil. The physiological effect creates an insoluble liquid depot from which droplets of allergen are gradually released. Another form of allergen desensitization is to polymerize monomeric allergens with glutaraldehyde to create a molecule with relatively low allergenicity (i.e., causes allergic response), while retaining an effective degree of immunogenicity.</p><p id="p-0381" num="0380">F. Pharmaceutical Dosages:</p><p id="p-0382" num="0381">Dosages and desired drug concentration of pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may vary depending on the particular use envisioned. The determination of the appropriate dosage or route of administration is well within the skill of an ordinary artisan. Animal experiments provide reliable guidance for the determination of effective doses for human therapy. Interspecies scaling of effective doses can be performed following the principles laid down by Mordenti, J. and Chappell, W. &#x201c;The Use of Interspecies Scaling in Toxicokinetics,&#x201d; In <i>Toxicokinetics and New Drug Development</i>, Yacobi et al., Eds, Pergamon Press, New York 1989, pp. 42-46.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0382">When in vivo administration of the polypeptides or antibodies described herein are used, normal dosage amounts may vary from about 10 ng/kg up to about 100 mg/kg of mammal body weight or more per day, preferably about 1 mg/kg/day to 10 mg/kg/day, depending upon the route of administration. Guidance as to particular dosages and methods of delivery is provided in the literature; see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,657,760; 5,206,344; or 5,225,212. It is within the scope of the invention that different formulations will be effective for different treatments and different disorders, and that administration intended to treat a specific organ or tissue may necessitate delivery in a manner different from that to another organ or tissue. Moreover, dosages may be administered by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0383">G. Administration of the Formulation</p><p id="p-0385" num="0384">The formulations of the present invention, including but not limited to reconstituted formulations, are administered to a mammal in need of treatment with the protein, preferably a human, in accord with known methods, such as intravenous administration as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerobrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral, topical, or inhalation routes.</p><p id="p-0386" num="0385">In preferred embodiments, the formulations are administered to the mammal by subcutaneous (i.e. beneath the skin) administration. For such purposes, the formulation may be injected using a syringe. However, other devices for administration of the formulation are available such as injection devices (e.g. the INJECT-EASE&#x2122; and GENJECT&#x2122; devices); injector pens (such as the GENPEN&#x2122;); auto-injector devices, needleless devices (e.g. MEDIJECTOR&#x2122; and BIOJECTOR&#x2122;); and subcutaneous patch delivery systems.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0386">In a specific embodiment, the present invention is directed to kits for a single dose-administration unit. Such kits comprise a container of an aqueous formulation of therapeutic protein or antibody, including both single or multi-chambered pre-filled syringes. Exemplary pre-filled syringes are available from Vetter GmbH, Ravensburg, Germany.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0387">The appropriate dosage (&#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d;) of the protein will depend, for example, on the condition to be treated, the severity and course of the condition, whether the protein is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the protein, the type of protein used, and the discretion of the attending physician. The protein is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments and may be administered to the patient at any time from diagnosis onwards. The protein may be administered as the sole treatment or in conjunction with other drugs or therapies useful in treating the condition in question.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0388">Where the protein of choice is an antibody, from about 0.1-20 mg/kg is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations.

Depending on the disease or disorder to be treated, a therapeutically effective amount (e.g. from about 1-15 mg/kg) of the anti-IgE antibody is administered to the patient.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0390">H. Articles of Manufacture</p><p id="p-0392" num="0391">In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture is provided which contains the formulation and preferably provides instructions for its use. The article of manufacture comprises a container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials (e.g. dual chamber vials), syringes (such as single or dual chamber syringes) and test tubes. The container may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds the formulation. The label, which is on, or associated with the container may indicate directions for reconstitution and/or use. The label may further indicate that the formulation is useful or intended for subcutaneous administration. The container holding the formulation may be a multi-use vial, which allows for repeat administrations (e.g. from 2-6 administrations) of the reconstituted formulation. The article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a suitable diluent (e.g. BWFI). Upon mixing of the diluent and the lyophilized formulation, the final protein concentration in the reconstituted formulation will generally be at least 50 mg/ml. The article of manufacture may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and package inserts with instructions for use.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0392">The invention will be more fully understood by reference to the following examples.

Rhesus and cyno IgE sequences were determined by cloning and sequencing the IgE from cDNA derived from rhesus and cyno peripheral blood mononuclear cells that had been stimulated to generated IgE-switched cells (PBMC). Forward and reverse primers (shown below) were designed from the human IgE sequences. An upstream forward primer was designed just upstream of the CH2 domain. The reverse primer was designed at the end of the transmembrane domain. Rhesus and Cyno PBMC was obtained from the California National Primate Research Center (Davis, Calif.). 5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>PBMC were cultured with IL-4 (100 ng/ml) and CD40L (3 &#x3bc;g/ml) (R&#x26;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., #204-IL and #617-CL respectively) for 4 days. Cells were then harvested, RNA was prepared (RNeasy Mini Kit, #74106, Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.), and cDNA made using BD Sprint Powerscript oligo dT priming kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif., #639558).

Each antibody was separated on a Precast 4-20% Tris HCl SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) under reducing condition. The resolved heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) were each subjected to N-terminal sequencing using a Procise 494 N-terminal sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) using the 20-min cycle as described by Henzel et al. <i>Analytical Biochemistry </i>267, 148-160 (1999). The first 25 residues were sequenced to establish monoclonality. When the HC or LC chain of the Ab was blocked with a pyroglutamyl group that made the N-terminal amino acid inaccessible to Edman sequencing, removal of the blocking group was performed prior to sequencing. The pyroglutamyl group was removed with the pyroglutamate aminopeptidase enzyme (PGAP, Sigma, St Louis, Mo.) using the protocol described by Pham et al. <i>Electrophoresis </i>2005, 26

Percent change and p-value (d41) were calculated by comparing each treatment group days 48 or 55 to the same group starting value in day 41 prior to treatment.</p><heading id="h-0071" level="1">EXAMPLE 13</heading><heading id="h-0072" level="1">Expression of Anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; Antibody in Mammalian Cells</heading><p id="p-0512" num="0511">This example illustrates preparation of potentially glycosylated forms of the desired protein or antibody by recombinant expression in mammalian cells.</p><p id="p-0513" num="0512">The vector, pRK5 (see EP 307,247, published Mar. 15, 1989), is employed as the expression vector. Optionally, DNA encoding the light and/or heavy chain of the anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody is ligated into pRK5 with selected restriction enzymes to allow insertion such DNA using ligation methods such as described in Sambrook et al., supra.</p><p id="p-0514" num="0513">In one embodiment, the selected host cells may be 293 cells. Human 293 cells (ATCC CCL 1573) are grown to confluence in tissue culture plates in medium such as DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum and optionally, nutrient components and/or antibiotics. About 10 &#x3bc;g if DNA encoding the anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody ligated into pRK5 is mixed with about 1 &#x3bc;g DNA encoding the VA RNA gene [Thimmappaya et al., <i>Cell, </i>31:543 (1982)] and dissolved in 500 &#x3bc;l of 1 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.227 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>. To this mixture is added, dropwise, 500 &#x3bc;l of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.35), 280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, and a precipitate is allowed to form for 10 minutes at 25&#xb0; C. The precipitate is suspended and added to the 293 cells and allowed to settle for about four hours at 37&#xb0; C. The culture medium is aspirated off and 2 ml of 20% glycerol in PBS is added for 30 seconds. The 293 cells are then washed with serum free medium, fresh medium is added and the cells are incubated for about 5 days.</p><p id="p-0515" num="0514">Approximately 24 hours after the transfections, the culture medium is removed and replaced with culture medium (alone) or culture medium containing 200 &#x3bc;Ci/ml <sup>35</sup>S-cysteine and 200 &#x3bc;Ci/ml <sup>35</sup>S-methionine. After a 12 hour incubation, the conditioned medium is collected, concentrated on a spin filter, and loaded onto a 15% SDS gel. The processed gel may be dried and exposed to film for a selected period of time to reveal the presence of the anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody. The cultures containing transfected cells may undergo further incubation (in serum free medium) and the medium is tested in selected bioassays.</p><p id="p-0516" num="0515">In an alternative technique, the anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody may be introduced into 293 cells transiently using the dextran sulfate method described by Somparyrac et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., </i>12:7575 (1981). 293 cells are grown to maximal density in a spinner flask and 700 &#x3bc;g DNA encoding the anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody ligated into pRK5 is added. The cells are first concentrated from the spinner flask by centrifugation and washed with PBS. The DNA-dextran precipitate is incubated on the cell pellet for four hours. The cells are treated with 20% glycerol for 90 seconds, washed with tissue culture medium, and re-introduced into the spinner flask containing tissue culture medium, 5 &#x3bc;g/ml bovine insulin and 0.1 &#x3bc;g/ml bovine transferrin. After about four days, the conditioned media is centrifuged and filtered to remove cells and debris. The sample containing the expressed anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody can then be concentrated and purified by any selected method, such as dialysis and/or column chromatography.</p><p id="p-0517" num="0516">In another embodiment, the anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody can be expressed in CHO cells. The DNA encoding the anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody ligated into pRK5 can be transfected into CHO cells using known reagents such as CaPO<sub>4 </sub>or DEAE-dextran. As described above, the cell cultures can be incubated, and the medium replaced with culture medium (alone) or medium containing a radiolabel such as <sup>35</sup>S-methionine. After determining the presence of the anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody, the culture medium may be replaced with serum free medium. Preferably, the cultures are incubated for about 6 days, and then the conditioned medium is harvested. The medium containing the expressed anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody can then be concentrated and purified by any selected method.</p><p id="p-0518" num="0517">Epitope-tagged variants of the anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody may also be expressed in host CHO cells. The DNA encoding the anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody ligated into pRK5 may be subcloned out of the pRK5 vector. The subclone insert can undergo PCR to fuse in frame with a selected epitope tag such as a poly-his tag into a Baculovirus expression vector. The poly-his tagged DNA encoding the anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody insert can then be subcloned into a SV40 driven vector containing a selection marker such as DHFR for selection of stable clones. Finally, the CHO cells can be transfected (as described above) with the SV40 driven vector. Labeling may be performed, as described above, to verify expression. The culture medium containing the expressed poly-His tagged anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody can then be concentrated and purified by any selected method, such as by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-chelate affinity chromatography.</p><p id="p-0519" num="0518">The anti-IgE/M1&#x2032; antibody may also be expressed in CHO and/or COS cells by a transient expression procedure or in CHO cells by another stable expression procedure.</p><p id="p-0520" num="0519">Stable expression in CHO cells is performed using the following procedure. The proteins are expressed as an IgG construct (immunoadhesin), in which the coding sequences for the soluble forms (e.g. extracellular domains) of the respective proteins are fused to an IgG1 constant region sequence containing the hinge, CH2 and CH2 domains and/or is a poly-His tagged form.</p><p id="p-0521" num="0520">Following PCR amplification, the respective DNAs are subcloned in a CHO expression vector using standard techniques as described in Ausubel et al., <i>Current Protocols of Molecular Biology</i>, Unit 3.16, John Wiley and Sons (1997). CHO expression vectors are constructed to have compatible restriction sites 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; of the DNA of interest to allow the convenient shuttling of cDNA's. The vector used expression in CHO cells is as described in Lucas et al., <i>Nucl. Acids Res. </i>24:9 (1774-1779 (1996), and uses the SV40 early promoter/enhancer to drive expression of the cDNA of interest and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). DHFR expression permits selection for stable maintenance of the plasmid following transfection.</p><p id="p-0522" num="0521">Twelve micrograms of the desired plasmid DNA is introduced into approximately 10 million CHO cells using commercially available transfection reagents SUPERFECT&#xae; (Quiagen), DOSPER&#xae; or FUGENE&#xae; (Boehringer Mannheim). The cells are grown as described in Lucas et al., supra. Approximately 3&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>cells are frozen in an ampule for further growth and production as described below.</p><p id="p-0523" num="0522">The ampules containing the plasmid DNA are thawed by placement into water bath and mixed by vortexing. The contents are pipetted into a centrifuge tube containing 10 mLs of media and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant is aspirated and the cells are resuspended in 10 mL of selective media (0.2 &#x3bc;m filtered PS20 with 5% 0.2 &#x3bc;m diafiltered fetal bovine serum). The cells are then aliquoted into a 100 mL spinner containing 90 mL of selective media. After 1-2 days, the cells are transferred into a 250 mL spinner filled with 150 mL selective growth medium and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. After another 2-3 days, 250 mL, 500 mL and 2000 mL spinners are seeded with 3&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells/mL. The cell media is exchanged with fresh media by centrifugation and resuspension in production medium. Although any suitable CHO media may be employed, a production medium described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,469, issued Jun. 16, 1992 may actually be used. A 3 L production spinner is seeded at 1.2&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL. On day 0, the cell number and pH is determined. On day 1, the spinner is sampled and sparging with filtered air is commenced. On day 2, the spinner is sampled, the temperature shifted to 33&#xb0; C., and 30 mL of 500 g/L glucose and 0.6 mL of 10% antifoam (e.g., 35% polydimethylsiloxane emulsion, Dow Corning 365 Medical Grade Emulsion) taken. Throughout the production, the pH is adjusted as necessary to keep it at around 7.2. After 10 days, or until the viability dropped below 70%, the cell culture is harvested by centrifugation and filtering through a 0.22 &#x3bc;m filter. The filtrate was either stored at 4&#xb0; C. or immediately loaded onto columns for purification.</p><p id="p-0524" num="0523">For the poly-His tagged constructs, the proteins are purified using a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen). Before purification, imidazole is added to the conditioned media to a concentration of 5 mM. The conditioned media is pumped onto a 6 ml Ni-NTA column equilibrated at 4&#xb0; C., in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole at a flow rate of 4-5 ml/min. After loading, the column is washed with additional equilibration buffer and the protein eluted with equilibration buffer containing 0.25 M imidazole. The highly purified protein is subsequently desalted into a storage buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, 0.14 M NaCl and 4% mannitol, pH 6.8, with a 25 ml G25 Superfine (Pharmacia) column and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0525" num="0524">Immunoadhesin (Fc-containing) constructs are purified from the conditioned media as follows. The conditioned medium is pumped onto a 5 ml Protein A column (Pharmacia) which had been equilibrated in 20 mM Na phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. After loading, the column is washed extensively with equilibration buffer before elution with 100 mM citric acid, pH 3.5. The eluted protein is immediately neutralized by collecting 1 ml fractions into tubes containing 275 &#x3bc;L of 1 M Tris buffer, pH 9. The highly purified protein is subsequently desalted into storage buffer as described above for the poly-His tagged proteins. The homogeneity is assessed by SDS polyacrylamide gels and by N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation.</p><heading id="h-0073" level="1">Deposit of Material</heading><p id="p-0526" num="0525">The following materials have been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, University Blvd., Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, USA (ATCC):</p><p id="p-0527" num="0526"><tables id="TABLE-US-00017" num="00017"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Material</entry><entry>ATCC Dep.
