Common to all of these diseases, termed synucleinopathies, are proteinaceous insoluble inclusions in the neurons and the glia which are composed primarily of alphaSN.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are intraneuronal inclusions which primarily contain of alphaSN. Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are the neuropathological hallmarks Parkinson's disease (PD). PD and other synucleinopathic diseases have been collectively referred to as Lewy body disease (LBD). LBD is characterized by degeneration of the dopaminergic system, motor alterations, cognitive impairment, and formation of Lewy bodies (LBs). (McKeith et al., <i>Clinical and pathological diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies </i>(<i>DLB</i>): <i>Report of the CDLB International Workshop, Neurology </i>(1996) 47:1113-24). Other LBDs include diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease (LBVAD), combined PD and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and multiple systems atrophy. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a term coined to reconcile differences in the terminology of LBDs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Disorders with LBs continue to be a common cause for movement disorders and cognitive deterioration in the aging population (Galasko et al., <i>Arch. Neurol. </i>(1994) 51:888-95). Although their incidence continues to increase creating a serious public health problem, to date these disorders are neither curable nor preventable and understanding the causes and pathogenesis of PD is critical towards developing new treatments (Tanner et al., <i>Curr. Opin. Neurol. </i>(2000) 13:427-30). The cause for PD is controversial and multiple factors have been proposed to play a role, including various neurotoxins and genetic susceptibility factors.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, new hope for understanding the pathogenesis of PD has emerged. Specifically, several studies have shown that the synaptic protein alpha-SN plays a central role in PD pathogenesis since: (1) this protein accumulates in LBs (Spillantini et al., <i>Nature </i>(1997) 388:839-40; Takeda et al., <i>AM. J. Pathol. </i>(1998) 152:367-72; Wakabayashi et al., <i>Neurosci. Lett. </i>(1997) 239:45-8), (2) mutations in the alpha-SN gene co-segregate with rare familial forms of parkinsonism (Kruger et al., <i>Nature Gen. </i>(1998) 18:106-8; Polymeropoulos M H, et al., <i>Science </i>(1997) 276:2045-7) and, (3) its overexpression in transgenic mice (Masliah et al., <i>Science </i>(2000) 287:1265-9) and <i>Drosophila </i>(Feany et al., <i>Nature </i>(2000) 404:394-8) mimics several pathological aspects of PD. Thus, the fact that accumulation of alpha-SN in the brain is associated with similar morphological and neurological alterations in species as diverse as humans, mice, and flies suggests that this molecule contributes to the development of PD.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Alpha-SN is part of a large family of proteins including beta- and gamma- synuclein and synoretin. Alpha-SN is expressed in the normal state associated with synapses and is believed to play a role in neural plasticity, learning and memory. Mutations in human (h) alpha-SN that enhance the aggregation of alpha-SN have been identified (Ala30Pro and Ala53Thr) and are associated with rare forms of autosomal dominant forms of PD. The mechanism by which these mutations increase the propensity of alpha-SN to aggregate are unknown.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE CLAIMED INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention provides a monoclonal antibody that competes with a monoclonal antibody shown in Table 1 for specific binding to alpha synuclein.

In some methods, the fluid sample contains 0.1-1.0 M guanidine. In some methods, the fluid sample contains 0.5 M guanidine. In some methods, the reporter antibody or the capture antibody is end-specific for the C-terminal end of SN1-119 or SN1-122. In some methods, the capturing step is performed twice with a first reporter antibody specifically binding to an epitope within SN1-119 and a second reporter antibody specifically binding to an antibody within SN120-140 and determining a ratio of captured alpha synuclein between the two steps, a higher ratio of synuclein captured by first reporter relative to second report being indicative of pathogenicity. In some methods, the reporter antibody in the first capturing step specifically binds to an epitope within SN 109-120, and the reporter antibody in the second capturing step specifically binds to an epitope within SN 120-126, and the capture antibody in both capturing steps specifically binds to an epitope within SN 91-99. In some methods, the capture antibody is immobilized to a solid phase, and the reporter antibody in solution, and the detecting step comprises detecting alpha synuclein from presence of the reporter antibody linked to the solid phase via binding of the reporter antibody to alpha synuclein, which is in turn bound to the capture antibody. Some methods involve a further step of comparing a signal from the reporter antibody linked to the solid phase from analyzing the sample with a signal from the reporter antibody linked to the solid phase from analyzing a control sample containing a known amount of alpha synuclein to determine the amount of alpha synuclein in the sample. In some methods, a signal from the reporter antibody linked to the solid phase from analyzing the sample to a calibration curve of signal is compared with an amount of alpha synuclein to determine the amount of alpha synuclein in the sample. In some methods, a signal from the reporter antibody is proportional to the amount of synuclein in the sample. Some methods further comprise contacting the reporter antibody with a labeled antibody to generate a signal indicating presence of the reporter antibody. In some methods, the capture antibody specifically binds to an epitope within amino acids 91-99 of human alpha synuclein and the reporter antibody binds to an epitope within amino acids 109-120 of alpha synuclein.

Thus, under designated immunoassay conditions, a specified molecule binds preferentially to a particular target and does not bind in a significant amount to other biologics present in the sample. Specific binding of an antibody to a target under such conditions requires the antibody be selected for its specificity to the target. A variety of immunoassay formats may be used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select monoclonal antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane (1988) <i>Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual</i>, Cold Spring Harbor Publications, New York, for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity. Specific binding between two entities means an affinity of at least 10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>7</sup>, 10<sup>8</sup>, M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, or 10<sup>10 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Affinities greater than 10<sup>8 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>are preferred. Lack of specific binding means an affinity of less than 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; or &#x201c;immunoglobulin&#x201d; is used to include intact antibodies and binding fragments thereof. Typically, fragments compete with the intact antibody from which they were derived for specific binding to an antigen fragment including separate heavy chains, light chains Fab, Fab&#x2032; F(ab&#x2032;)2, Fabc, and Fv. Fragments are produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical separation of intact immunoglobulins. The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; also includes one or more immunoglobulin chains that are chemically conjugated to, or expressed as, fusion proteins with other proteins. The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; also includes bispecific antibody. A bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab&#x2032; fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai &#x26; Lachmann, <i>Clin. Exp. Immunol. </i>79:315-321 (1990); Kostelny et al., <i>J. Immunol. </i>148, 1547-1553 (1992).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Antibodies of the invention are typically substantially pure from undesired contaminant. This means that an agent is typically at least about 50% w/w (weight/weight) purity, as well as being substantially free from interfering proteins and contaminants. Sometimes the antibodies are at least about 80% w/w and, more preferably at least 90 or about 95% w/w purity. However, using conventional protein purification techniques, homogeneous peptides of at least 99% w/w can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">An &#x201c;antigen&#x201d; is an entity to which an antibody specifically binds.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; or &#x201c;antigenic determinant&#x201d; refers to a site on an antigen to which B and/or T cells respond. B-cell epitopes can be formed both from contiguous amino acids or noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of a protein. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are typically retained on exposure to denaturing solvents whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost on treatment with denaturing solvents. An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation. Methods of determining spatial conformation of epitopes include, for example, x-ray crystallography and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance.

Antibodies that recognize the same epitope can be identified in a simple immunoassay showing the ability of one antibody to block the binding of another antibody to a target antigen.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The term &#x201c;compete&#x201d; means competition between antibodies is determined by an assay in which the immunoglobulin under test inhibits specific binding of a reference antibody to a common antigen, such as alpha-SN. Numerous types of competitive binding assays are known, for example: solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see Stahli et al., <i>Methods in Enzymology </i>9:242-253 (1983)); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see Kirkland et al., <i>J. Immunol. </i>137:3614-3619 (1986)); solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see Harlow and Lane, <i>Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual</i>, Cold Spring Harbor Press (1988)); solid phase direct label RIA using I-125 label (see Morel et al., Molec. <i>Immunol. </i>25(1):7-15 (1988)); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (Cheung et al., <i>Virology </i>176:546-552 (1990)); and direct labeled RIA (Moldenhauer et al., <i>Scand. J. Immunol. </i>32:77-82 (1990)). Typically, such an assay involves the use of purified antigen bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of these, an unlabelled test immunoglobulin and a labeled reference immunoglobulin. Competitive inhibition is measured by determining the amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test immunoglobulin. Usually the test immunoglobulin is present in excess. Antibodies identified by competition assay (competing antibodies) include antibodies binding to the same epitope as the reference antibody and antibodies binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference antibody for steric hindrance to occur. Usually, when a competing antibody is present in excess, it will inhibit specific binding of a reference antibody to a common antigen by at least 50 or 75%.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The terms &#x201c;conditioned culture medium&#x201d; and &#x201c;culture medium&#x201d; refer to the aqueous extracellular fluid which surrounds cells grown in tissue culture (in vitro) and which contains, among other constituents, proteins and peptides secreted by the cells.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The term &#x201c;body fluid&#x201d; refers to those fluids of a mammalian host which is suspected contain measurable amounts of alpha synuclein or fragments thereof, specifically including blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, and peritoneal fluid.

Antibodies of the Invention</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The invention provides several exemplary monoclonal antibodies to different epitopes of alpha synuclein as shown in Table 1. Hybridomas producing the respective antibodies are also provided. The hybridomas producing the antibodies have been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) at 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209. The cell line designated JH22.11A5.6.29.70.54.16.14, producing the antibody 11A5 having the ATCC accession number PTA-8222 has been deposited on Feb. 26, 2007 at the ATCC; the cell line designated JH4.8A5.25.7.36, producing the antibody 8A5 having the ATCC accession number PTA-6909 has been deposited on Aug. 4, 2005 at the ATCC; the cell line designated JH17.1H7.4.24.34, producing the antibody 1H7 having the ATCC accession number PTA-8220, has been deposited on Feb. 26, 2007 at the ATCC; the cell line designated JH17.9E4.3.37.1.14.2, producing the antibody 9E4 having the ATCC accession number PTA-8221 has been deposited on Feb. 26, 2007 at the ATCC; the cell line designated JH17.6H7.1.54.28, producing the antibody 6H7 having the ATCC accession number PTA-6910 has been deposited at the ATCC; the cell line designated JH4.5C12.4.15.57, producing the antibody 5C12 having the ATCC accession number PTA-9197 has been deposited on May 8, 2008 at the ATCC. The first column of Table 1 shows the name of an antibody. The same name is used to refer to an antibody and the hybridoma producing it. The second column shows the antigen used to generate the antibody. The third column indicates the epitope bound by the antibody. The fourth column indicates the isotype. The fifth column indicates applications of the antibody (immunofluorescence, Western blot, immunoprecipitation, histology, and capture and reporter antibody for a sandwich assay). The invention further provides humanized and chimeric forms of mouse monoclonals, particularly of the exemplified antibodies shown in Table 1.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The invention also provides other antibodies that compete with one of the exemplified antibodies for specific binding to alpha-synuclein (i.e., bind to the same epitope as an exemplified antibody or a sufficiently proximal epitope to interfere with the binding of an exemplified antibody to its epitope). The invention also provides antibodies that bind to the same epitope as one of the exemplified antibodies. Antibodies that compete with or bind to the same epitope as an exemplified antibody are expected to show similar functional properties. Such antibodies include mouse and other nonhuman antibodies, human antibodies, chimerics and humanized antibodies. Such antibodies include monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibody. A polyclonal antibody specifically binds to an epitope if it binds to the epitope without binding to other regions of alpha synuclein. This is usually true of a monoclonal antibody as well. However, some monoclonal antibodies can be designed or selected to have specificity for two epitopes within alpha synuclein.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Some preferred epitope specificities include monoclonal antibodies that specifically binds to a repeated epitope comprising residues within residues 43-51 and residues within residues 58-65, monoclonal antibodies that specifically binds to an epitope within residues 118-126; monoclonal antibodies that specifically binds to an epitope comprising residues 91-99, monoclonal antibodies that specifically binds to an epitope comprising residues 40-55; monoclonal antibodies that specifically binds to an epitope comprising residues 124-134, wherein residue 129 is phosphorylated serine, and monoclonal antibodies that specifically binds to an epitope comprising residues 123-127, wherein residue 125 is nitrated tyrosine.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">When an antibody is said to bind to an epitope within specified residues, such as alpha-SN 109-120, for example, what is meant is that the antibody specifically binds to a polypeptide consisting of the specified residues (i.e., alpha-SN 109-120 in this an example). Such an antibody does not necessarily contact every residue within alpha-SN 109-120. Nor does every single amino acid substitution or deletion with in alpha-SN109-120 necessarily significantly affect binding affinity. Epitope specificity of an antibody can be determined, for example, by testing a collection of overlapping peptides of about 15 amino acids spanning the sequence of alpha-synuclein and differing in increments of a small number of amino acids (e.g., 3 amino acids). The peptides are immobilized within the wells of a microtiter dish. Immobilization can be effected by biotinylating one terminus of the peptides. Optionally, different samples of the same peptide can be biotinylated at the N and C terminus and immobilized in separate wells for purposes of comparison. Such is particularly useful for identifying end-specific antibodies. Optionally, additional peptides can be included terminating at a particular amino acid of interest (e.g., the first and last residue of the NAC fragment). Such is particularly useful for identifying end-specific antibodies to internal fragments of alpha synuclein. An antibody is screened for specific binding to each of the various peptides. The epitope is defined as occurring within a segment of amino acids that is common to all peptides to which the antibody shows specific binding.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">i. General Characteristics of Immunoglobulins</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The basic antibody structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer of subunits. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one &#x201c;light&#x201d; (about 25 kDa) and one &#x201c;heavy&#x201d; chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a &#x201c;J&#x201d; region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a &#x201c;D&#x201d; region of about 10 more amino acids. (See generally, <i>Fundamental Immunology</i>, Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y., 1989, Ch. 7 (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site. Thus, an intact antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are the same. The chains all exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the two chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat, <i>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest </i>(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1987 and 1991); Chothia &#x26; Lesk, <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>196:901-917 (1987); or Chothia et al., <i>Nature </i>342:878-883 (1989).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">ii. Production of Nonhuman Antibodies</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Chimeric and humanized antibodies have the same or similar binding specificity and affinity as a mouse or other nonhuman antibody that provides the starting material for construction of a chimeric or humanized antibody. Chimeric antibodies are antibodies whose light and heavy chain genes have been constructed, typically by genetic engineering, from immunoglobulin gene segments belonging to different species. For example, DNA encoding the variable domains of a mouse antibody can be sequenced, and DNA construct(s) encoding the variable domains joined to human constant (C) segments, such as IgG1 and IgG4 constructed. The constructs are then expressed to produce the antibody Human isotype IgG1 is preferred. In some methods, the isotype of the antibody is human IgG1. IgM antibodies can also be used in some methods. A typical chimeric antibody is thus a hybrid protein consisting of the V or antigen-binding domain from a mouse antibody and the C or effector domain from a human antibody.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Humanized antibodies have variable region framework residues substantially from a human antibody or consensus of human antibodies (termed an acceptor antibody) and some and usually all six complementarity determining regions substantially or entirely from a mouse-antibody, (referred to as the donor immunoglobulin). See, Queen et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>86:10029-10033 (1989), WO 90/07861, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,693,762, 5,693,761, 5,585,089, 5,530,101, and Winter, U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539 (each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The constant region(s), if present, are also substantially or entirely from a human immunoglobulin. The human variable domains are usually chosen from human antibodies whose framework sequences exhibit a high degree of sequence identity with the murine variable region domains from which the CDRs were derived. The heavy and light chain variable region framework residues can be derived from the same or different human antibody sequences. The human antibody sequences can be the sequences of naturally occurring human antibodies or can be consensus sequences of several human antibodies. See Carter et al., WO 92/22653. Certain amino acids from the human variable region framework residues are selected for substitution based on their possible influence on CDR conformation and/or binding to antigen. Investigation of such possible influences is by modeling, examination of the characteristics of the amino acids at particular locations, or empirical observation of the effects of substitution or mutagenesis of particular amino acids.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, when an amino acid differs between a murine variable region framework residue and a selected human variable region framework residue, the human framework amino acid should usually be substituted by the equivalent framework amino acid from the mouse antibody when it is reasonably expected that the amino acid:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0052">(1) noncovalently binds antigen directly,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0053">(2) is adjacent to a CDR region,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0054">(3) otherwise interacts with a CDR region (e.g. is within about 6 A of a CDR region), or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0055">(4) participates in the VL-VH interface.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0053" num="0056">Other candidates for substitution are acceptor human framework amino acids that are unusual for a human immunoglobulin at that position. These amino acids can be substituted with amino acids from the equivalent position of the mouse donor antibody or from the equivalent positions of more typical human immunoglobulins. Other candidates for substitution are acceptor human framework amino acids that are unusual for a human immunoglobulin at that position. The variable region frameworks of humanized immunoglobulins usually show at least 85% sequence identity to a human variable region framework sequence or consensus of such sequences.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0057">iii. Human Antibodies</p><p id="p-0055" num="0058">Human antibodies against alpha-SN are provided by a variety of techniques described below. Some human antibodies are selected by competitive binding experiments, or otherwise, to have the same epitope specificity as a particular mouse antibody, such as one of the mouse monoclonals shown in Table 1. Human antibodies can also be screened for a particular epitope specificity by using only a fragment of alpha-SN as the immunogen, and/or by screening antibodies against a collection of deletion mutants of alpha-SN. Human antibodies preferably have isotype specificity human IgG1. Several methods are available for producing human antibodies including the trioma method, Oestberg et al., <i>Hybridoma </i>2:361-367 (1983); Oestberg, U.S. Pat.

Selection of Constant Region</p><p id="p-0057" num="0060">The heavy and light chain variable regions of chimeric, humanized, or human antibodies can be linked to at least a portion of a human constant region. The choice of constant region depends, in part, whether antibody-dependent complement and/or cellular mediated toxicity is desired. For example, isotopes IgG1 and IgG3 have complement activity and isotypes IgG2 and IgG4 do not. Choice of isotype can also affect passage of antibody into the brain. Human isotype IgG1 is preferred. Light chain constant regions can be lambda or kappa. Antibodies can be expressed as tetramers containing two light and two heavy chains, as separate heavy chains, light chains, as Fab, Fab&#x2032; F(ab&#x2032;)2, and Fv, or as single chain antibodies in which heavy and light chain variable domains are linked through a spacer.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0061">v. Expression of Recombinant Antibodies</p><p id="p-0059" num="0062">Chimeric, humanized and human antibodies are typically produced by recombinant expression. Recombinant polynucleotide constructs typically include an expression control sequence operably linked to the coding sequences of antibody chains, including naturally associated or heterologous promoter regions. Preferably, the expression control sequences are eukaryotic promoter systems in vectors capable of transforming or transfecting eukaryotic host cells. Once the vector has been incorporated into the appropriate host, the host is maintained under conditions suitable for high level expression of the nucleotide sequences, and the collection and purification of the crossreacting antibodies.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0063">These expression vectors are typically replicable in the host organisms either as episomes or as an integral part of the host chromosomal DNA. Commonly, expression vectors contain selection markers, e.g., ampicillin-resistance or hygromycin-resistance, to permit detection of those cells transformed with the desired DNA sequences.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0064"><i>E. coli </i>is one prokaryotic host particularly useful for cloning the DNA sequences of the present invention. Microbes, such as yeast are also useful for expression. Saccharomyces is a preferred yeast host, with suitable vectors having expression control sequences, an origin of replication, termination sequences and the like as desired. Typical promoters include 3-phosphoglycerate kinase and other glycolytic enzymes. Inducible yeast promoters include, among others, promoters from alcohol dehydrogenase, isocytochrome C, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0065">Mammalian cells are a preferred host for expressing nucleotide segments encoding immunoglobulins or fragments thereof. See Winnacker, <i>From Genes to Clones</i>, (VCH Publishers, NY, 1987). A number of suitable host cell lines capable of secreting intact heterologous proteins have been developed in the art, and include CHO cell lines, various COS cell lines, HeLa cells, L cells, human embryonic kidney cell, and myeloma cell lines. Preferably, the cells are nonhuman. Expression vectors for these cells can include expression control sequences, such as an origin of replication, a promoter, an enhancer (Queen et al., <i>Immunol. Rev. </i>89:49 (1986)), and necessary processing information sites, such as ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and transcriptional terminator sequences. Preferred expression control sequences are promoters derived from endogenous genes, cytomegalovirus, SV40, adenovirus, bovine papillomavirus, and the like. See Co et al., <i>J. Immunol. </i>148:1149 (1992).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0066">Alternatively, antibody coding sequences can be incorporated in transgenes for introduction into the genome of a transgenic animal and subsequent expression in the milk of the transgenic animal (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,741,957, 5,304,489, 5,849,992). Suitable transgenes include coding sequences for light and/or heavy chains in operable linkage with a promoter and enhancer from a mammary gland specific gene, such as casein or beta lactoglobulin.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0067">The vectors containing the DNA segments of interest can be transferred into the host cell by well-known methods, depending on the type of cellular host. For example, calcium chloride transfection is commonly utilized for prokaryotic cells, whereas calcium phosphate treatment, electroporation, lipofection, biolistics or viral-based transfection can be used for other cellular hosts. Other methods used to transform mammalian cells include the use of polybrene, protoplast fusion, liposomes, electroporation, and microinjection (see generally, Sambrook et al., supra). For production of transgenic animals, transgenes can be microinjected into fertilized oocytes, or can be incorporated into the genome of embryonic stem cells, and the nuclei of such cells transferred into enucleated oocytes.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0068">Once expressed, antibodies can be purified according to standard procedures of the art, including HPLC purification, column chromatography, and gel electrophoresis and the like (see generally, Scopes, Protein Purification (Springer-Verlag, N.Y., 1982).</p><p id="h-0008" num="0000">II.

Some forms of alpha-SN peptide are also available commercially, for example, at BACHEM and American Peptide Company, Inc.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0081">Beta synuclein shows 78% sequence similarity with alpha synuclein at the amino acid level. Gamma synuclein shares 60% similarity at the amino acid level with alpha-synuclein (see Biere et al., J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 275, Issue 44, 34574-34579, Nov. 3, 2000, incorporated by reference).</p><p id="h-0009" num="0000">III. Assays for Detecting Alpha Synuclein</p><p id="p-0079" num="0082">Antibodies of the invention can be used to detect alpha synuclein or fragments thereof in a variety of formats including immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, ELISA, radioimmunoassay, competitive and isometric assays. See Harlow &#x26; Lane, <i>Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual </i>(CSHP NY, 1988); U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,791,932; 3,839,153; 3,850,752; 3,879,262; 4,034,074, 3,791,932; 3,817,837; 3,839,153; 3,850,752; 3,850,578; 3,853,987; 3,867,517; 3,879,262; 3,901,654; 3,935,074; 3,984,533; 3,996,345; 4,034,074; and 4,098,876.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0083">Isometric or sandwich assays are a preferred format (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,376,110, 4,486,530, 5,914,241, and 5,965,375). Such assays use one antibody immobilized to a solid phase (capture antibody), and another antibody in solution (reporter antibody). Typically, the reporter antibody is labeled, either directly or via a secondary labeling reagent, such as an anti-idiotypic antibody. The capture and reporter antibodies having different binding specificities so both can bind to alpha-synuclein or a fragment thereof at the same time. Capture and reporter antibodies can be contacted with target antigen in either order or simultaneously. If the capture antibody is contacted first, the assay is referred to as being a forward assay. Conversely, if the reporter antibody is contacted first, the assay is referred to as being a reverse assay. If target is contacted with both antibodies simultaneously, the assay is referred to as a simultaneous assay. After contacting the target with antibody, a sample is incubated for a period that usually varies from about 10 min to about 24 hr and is usually about 1 hr. A wash step is then performed to remove components of the sample that do not become specifically bound to the solid phase. When capture and reporter antibodies are bound in separate steps, a wash can be performed after either or both binding steps. After washing, binding is quantified, typically by detecting label linked to the solid phase through binding of labeled reporter. Usually for a given pair of antibodies, a calibration curve is prepared from samples containing known concentrations of target antigen. Concentrations of antigen in samples being tested are then read by interpolation from the calibration curve. Analyte can be measured either from the amount of labeled reporter antibody bound at equilibrium or by kinetic measurements of bound labeled solution antibody at a series of time points before equilibrium is reached. The slope of such a curve is a measure of the concentration of target in a sample. Alternatively, the amount of alpha synuclein in a sample can be determined by comparing the signal of reporter antibody bound to alpha synuclein the sample with the signal from reporter antibody bound to a known amount of alpha synuclein in a control sample.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0084">Competitive assays can also be used. In some methods, target alpha-synuclein in a sample competes with exogenously supplied labeled alpha synuclein for binding to an antibody. The amount of labeled alpha synuclein bound to the antibody is inversely proportional to the amount of target alpha synuclein in the sample. The antibody can be immobilized to facilitate separation of the bound complex from the sample prior to detection (heterogeneous assays) or separation may be unnecessary as practiced in homogeneous assay formats. In other methods, the antibody used as a detection reagent is labeled. When the antibody is labeled, its binding sites compete for binding to the target alpha synuclein in the sample and exogenously supplied form of alpha synuclein immobilized on a solid phase.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0085">Suitable detectable labels for use in the above methods include any moiety that is detectable by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, electrical, optical, chemical, or other means. For example, suitable labels include biotin for staining with labeled streptavidin conjugate, fluorescent dyes (e.g., fluorescein, Texas red, rhodamine, green fluorescent protein, and the like), radiolabels (e.g., . <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>14</sup>C, or <sup>32</sup>P), enzymes (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase and others commonly used in an ELISA), and colorimetric labels such as colloidal gold or colored glass or plastic (e.g., polystyrene, polypropylene, latex beads). Patents that described the use of such labels include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,817,837; 3,850,752; 3,939,350; 3,996,345; 4,277,437; 4,275,149; and 4,366,241. See also Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals (6th Ed., Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene Oreg.). Radiolabels can be detected using photographic film or scintillation counters, fluorescent markers can be detected using a photodetector to detect emitted light. Enzymatic labels are typically detected by providing the enzyme with a substrate and detecting the reaction product produced by the action of the enzyme on the substrate, and colorimetric labels are detected by simply visualizing the colored label.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0086">Suitable supports for use in the above methods include, for example, nitrocellulose membranes, nylon membranes, and derivatized nylon membranes, and also particles, such as agarose, a dextran-based gel, dipsticks, particulates, microspheres, magnetic particles, test tubes, microtiter wells, SEPHADEX&#x2122;. (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway N.J., and the like. Immobilization can be by absorption or by covalent attachment. Optionally, antibodies can be joined to a linker molecule, such as biotin for attachment to a surface.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0087">Solvents used to extract alpha synuclein from tissue samples can decrease the sensitivity of the assay (e.g., 5M guanidine, urea/thiourea/CHAPS, urea/thiourea, 1% SDS, 1%SDS/8M, cell lysis buffer). It is recommended that such solvents be removed or diluted such that they account for less than 1% and preferably less than 0.1% of the buffer used for the assay.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0088">Preferred pairs of monoclonal antibodies for use in isometric assays are as follows. In one combination, the capture antibody specifically binds an epitope within residues selected from the group consisting of N-terminus, 40-55, 91-99 and 118-126, and the reporter antibody specifically binds an epitope within residues 109-120. Another suitable pairing is an antibody that specifically binds to an epitope within residues 124-134 and is specific for the phosphorylated form and another antibody that specifically binds to an epitope within residues 91-99. Other suitable pairings include an antibody that competes with 6H7 and an antibody that competes with 5C12 or 12C1; an antibody that competes with 3A12 and an antibody that competes with 5C12 or 6H7; an antibody that competes with 12C1 and an antibody that competes with 5C12 or 6H7; an antibody that competes with 9A6 and an antibody that competes with 5C12, 6H7 or 12C1; an antibody that competes with 9G5 and an antibody that competes with 5C12, 6H7 or 12C1; an antibody that competes with 9E4 and an antibody that competes with 5C12, 6H7 or 12C1; an antibody that competes with 1H7 and an antibody that competes with 5C12, 6H7 or 12C1; and an antibody that competes with 10G5 and an antibody that competes with 5C12, 6H7 or 12C1, and antibody that competes with 1H7 and an antibody that competes with 11A5. Preferred pairings include 6H7 and 5C12 or 12C1; 3A12 and 5C12 or 6H7; 12C1 and 5C12 or 6H7; 9A6 and 5C12, 6H7 or 12C1; 9G5 and 5C12, 6H7 or 12C1; 9E4 and 5C12, 6H7 or 12C1; 1H7 and 5C12, 6H7 or 12C1; 10G5 and 5C12, 6H7 or 12C1, 1H7 and 11A5.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0089">Some method employ either a capture or a reporter antibody that is end-specific for a fragment of alpha-synuclein, particularly, SN1-119 (i.e., residues 1-119 of SEQ ID NO:1) or SN1-122 (residues 1-122 of SEQ ID NO:1). Applications for detection of these fragments are described below.</p><p id="h-0010" num="0000">IV. Applications</p><p id="p-0087" num="0090">A. Body Fluids</p><p id="p-0088" num="0091">In vivo detection of alpha synuclein in patient samples can be used for diagnosing and monitoring diseases characterized by Lewy bodies or other deposits of alpha synuclein. Synucleinopathic diseases include Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease (LBVAD), multiple systems atrophy (MSA), neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation type-1 (NBIA-1), diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), and combined PD and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Suitable patient samples include body fluids, such as blood, CSF, urine, and peritoneal fluid. The presence of a synucleinopathic disease is generally associated with significantly altered levels of alpha synuclein or fragments thereof in the fluid (increased or decreased) when compared to the mean values in normal individuals, i.e., individuals not suffering from a synucleinopathic disease. A level is significantly altered if it departs by more than one standard deviation from the mean level in a population of normal individuals.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0092">In addition to initial diagnosis of synucleinopathic disease, condition, the measured concentrations of alpha synuclein and its fragments can be monitored to follow the progress of the disease, and potentially follow the effectiveness of treatment. Levels of alpha-synuclein and its fragments revert toward the mean in a population of normal individuals if the treatment regime is effective.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0093">B. Cell culture</p><p id="p-0091" num="0094">In vitro monitoring of alpha synculein and its fragment in conditioned culture medium from a suitable cell culture can be used for analyzing processing and secretion of alpha-synuclein and the effect of potential agents on the same. Monitoring processing of alpha synuclein provides a means to study proteolytic cleavage, identify responsible proteases, determine what factors affect cleavage, and determine the physiological function of truncated forms of alpha synuclein. Agents that inhibit processing and/or secretion of alpha synuclein have pharmacological activity potentially useful for prophylaxis of synucleinopathic disease. Typically, inhibitory activity is determined by comparing levels of alpha synuclein and/or its fragments in medium from a cell treated with a test agent versus a comparable control cell not treated with the agent. As discussed in copending application U.S. Ser. No. 60/471,929 filed May 19, 2003, U.S. Ser. No. 10/850,570 filed May 19, 2004 and attorney docket 015270-011520US filed Oct. 19, 2004, which is a CIP thereof, certain fragments of alpha synuclein with C-terminal truncations preferentially accumulate in Lewy bodies (e.g., SN1-119 and SN1-122). For example, media from PeakS cells transfected with alpha synuclein contain two prominent truncated species of about 12 and 7 kDa. Agents inhibiting processing reactions that form such fragments therefore have pharmacological activity useful for treating diseases characterized by Lewy bodies. The NAC fragment of alpha synuclein accumulates in extracellular amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease. Agents that inhibit formation or secretion of NAC therefore have pharmacological activity useful for treating Alzheimer's disease.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0095">Suitable cells include cells transfected with nucleic acids encoding alpha synuclein, preferably, human alpha synuclein and cells naturally expressing alpha synuclein, also preferably human. The alpha synuclein in transfected cells can bear a mutation, such as S129A, S129D, A53T and A20P. Cells include PeakS cells, SY5Y cells, human cortical cells, human neuroglioma cell lines, human HeLa cells, primary human endothelial cells (e.g. HUVEC cells), primary human fibroblasts or lymphoblasts, primary human mixed brain cells (including neurons, astrocytes, and neuroglia), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and the like. SY5Y cells are neuronal cells that can be induced to differentiate by treatment with retinoic acid/BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor). Transfected cells expressing alpha synuclein at higher levels than normal human cells are preferred. In some such cells, the alpha synuclein bears a mutation associated with synucleinopathic disease.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0096">Random libraries of peptides or other compounds can also be screened for suitability. Combinatorial libraries can be produced for many types of compounds that can be synthesized in a step-by-step fashion. Such compounds include polypeptides, beta-turn mimetics, polysaccharides, phospholipids, hormones, prostaglandins, steroids, aromatic compounds, heterocyclic compounds, benzodiazepines, oligomeric N-substituted glycines and oligocarbamates. Large combinatorial libraries of the compounds can be constructed by the encoded synthetic libraries (ESL) method described in Affymax, WO 95/12608, Affymax, WO 93/06121, Columbia University, WO 94/08051, Pharmacopeia, WO 95/35503 and Scripps, WO 95/30642 (each of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes). Peptide libraries can also be generated by phage display methods. See, e.g., Devlin, WO 91/18980. The test compounds are typically administered to the culture medium at a concentration in the range from about 1 nM to 1 mM, usually from about 10 &#x3bc;M to 1 mM. Test compounds which are able to inhibit formation, processing or secretion of alpha synuclein are candidates for further determinations in transgenic animals and eventually human clinical trials.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0097">C. Transgenic Animals</p><p id="p-0095" num="0098">The antibodies of the invention and assays for detecting them can also be used to monitor alpha synuclein production, and processing in transgenic animal models of disease. Transgenic animal models of Lewy body disease are described by Masliah, et al. <i>Science </i>287:1265-1269 (2000); Masliah et al., PNAS USA 98:12245-12250 (2001). Alpha synuclein can be analyzed either in body fluids as described above for human samples, or in tissue samples taken directly from the animal (see copending 60/423,012, filed Nov. 1, 2002, incorporated by reference). Tissue samples can be classified as Lewy body, particulate fraction and soluble fractions. Simple assays can be performed as for cell culture to screen agents for capacity to inhibit formation of alpha synuclein or its processing to fragments. Typically, the inhibitory activity is determined by comparing the level of alpha synuclein or a fragment thereof in a particularly body fluid or fraction from a tissue sample from a transgenic animal treated with the agent in comparison with the level of alpha synuclein or the fragment in the same body fluid or fraction in a control transgenic animal not treated with the agent. Inhibitory activity is shown by decreased levels of alpha synuclein of fragment thereof in the treated animal relative to the control.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0099">Tissue samples from the brains of human patients can be subject to similar analyses. However, as obtaining samples from the brains of patient is an undesirably invasive procedure, such analyses are usually confined to cadavers. The analyses are useful, for example, in identifying fragments of alpha synuclein that preferentially accumulate in Lewy bodies, as described in copending application 60/471,929, filed May 19, 2003 and its progeny supra.</p><p id="h-0011" num="0000">V. Kits</p><p id="p-0097" num="0100">The invention further provides kits including one or more antibodies of the invention. In some kits the antibodies are preimmobilized to a solid phase. For example, several different antibodies can be immobilized to the wells of a microtiter dish. Optionally, labeling reagents, such as an antiidiotypic antibody are also included in the kits. The labeling may also include a chart or other correspondence regime correlating levels of measured label with levels of antibodies to alpha-SN. The term labeling refers to any written or recorded material that is attached to, or otherwise accompanies a kit at any time during its manufacture, transport, sale or use. For example, the term labeling encompasses advertising leaflets and brochures, packaging materials, instructions, audio or video cassettes, computer discs, as well as writing imprinted directly on kits. The kits can be sold, for example, as research or diagnostic reagents.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0101">Although the invention has been described in detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.

Although the 5C12 antibody binds to both mouse and human alpha synuclein, this is not a problem in human samples because no mouse synuclein is present. The combination of 1H7 capture 9E4 reporter for detecting human alpha synuclein in transgenic mouse brains is recommended. 9E4 is specific to human alpha synuclein. Both formats are specific for alpha-synuclein. The combination of 1H7 capture and 8A5 reporter is recommended for measurement of alpha synuclein having an intact C-terminus. The combination of 11A5 capture and 5C12 reporter is suitable for detecting alpha synuclein phosphorylated at residue 129. The combination of 1H7 as capture antibody and 11A5 as reporter offers about ten-fold greater sensitivity. The 11A5 antibody is specific for alpha synuclein phosphorylated at residue 129.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0113">A calibration curve showing OD450 vs. concentration of alpha synuclein using 1H7 and 5C12 as capture and reporter antibody is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

The actual sensitivity is about twenty fold greater than the measure value of 9 ng/ml because the alpha synuclein was only about 6% phosphorylated.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0114">The capacity of the ELISA assay to quantify synuclein in a sample was testing by spiking brain homogenates from nontransgenic mice with known amounts of alpha synuclein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows the results using 1H7/5C12 as capture and reporter antibodies.

A brain homogenate was spun at 1000 g. The pellet was the source of Lewy bodies. These were prepared by Percoll gradient density fractionation, DNA digestion, and immunoaffinity purification using antibodies tagged with magnetic beads. Optionally, the alpha synuclein content of Lewy bodies can be enriched by stripping with the anionic detergent sarkosyl. The soluble and particulate fractions were prepared by spinning the initial supernatant at 150,000 g. The resulting supernatant was referred to as a soluble fraction, and the pellet as the particulate fraction. Synuclein can be extracted from these fractions using 0.5 and 5 M guanidine respectively. Note that the Lewy body samples were in UTC and that the soluble brain samples were prepared in Tris-buffered sucrose, and were assayed at a dilution in which these buffers did not interfere with the ELISA.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0116">The soluble extract of the 8 human brains assayed contain approximately 0.03% of &#x3b1;-synuclein. There is a trend toward decreasing amounts of &#x3b1;-synuclein in the soluble brain fraction of a diseased patient. (Table 4). There is a statistically significant increase in the amount of synuclein in the particulate fraction of the DLBD brain (Table 5). The increased level of synuclein may be due to immature Lewy bodies that are to small to pellet with mature Lewy bodies in the initial centrifugation.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0117">The amount of &#x3b1;-synuclein in the Lewy body prep varies. According to the 1H7/5C12 ELISA, synuclein comprises at most 0.07% of the total Lewy body protein. The 1H7/9E4 ELISA measures approximately 60% less &#x3b1;-synuclein in the Lewy bodies than the 1H7/5C12 ELISA. The 9E4 reporter antibody recognizes an epitope more C-terminal than that of 5C12, and therefore the assay may simply reflect the presence of C-terminal truncations in the Lewy bodies as seen on 2-D gels. In this case loss of 9E4 reactivity or a lowered ratio of 9E4/5C12 activity (or other antibodies with the same or similar epitopes) is a marker of pathogenicity. Indeed, the 9E4 epitope encompasses the estimated cleavage sites. The soluble fraction contains less truncated synuclein and did show only a 12% difference between the ELISA assays consistent with this interpretation. An alternate explanation is that 9E4's epitope is modified or masked (perhaps due to the aggregation as described above or modification of tyrosine at 125) and cannot be detected.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0118"><tables id="TABLE-US-00007" num="00007"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 4</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Soluble fraction</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="69.60mm" wi="55.54mm" file="US07674599-20100309-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="table" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0116" num="0119"><tables id="TABLE-US-00008" num="00008"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 5</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>(&#x3b1;-Synuclein ELISA Results From Lewy Bodies</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="80.86mm" wi="54.86mm" file="US07674599-20100309-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="table" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0117" num="0120"><tables id="TABLE-US-00009" num="00009"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 6</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Alpha synuclein in Lewy bodies</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="112pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>ng &#x3b1;-Synuclein/mg Protein</entry><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Sample</entry><entry>5C12</entry><entry>9 E4</entry><entry>9 E4/5C12</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>P36A</entry><entry>7596</entry><entry>2442</entry><entry>32%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>P36A</entry><entry>7413</entry><entry>1587</entry><entry>21%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>P40A</entry><entry>561</entry><entry>180</entry><entry>32%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>P40A</entry><entry>557</entry><entry>206</entry><entry>37%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>P50A</entry><entry>3836</entry><entry>823</entry><entry>21%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>P50A</entry><entry>3761</entry><entry>896</entry><entry>24%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Mean</entry><entry>3954</entry><entry>1022</entry><entry>28%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables><br/>Detection of &#x3b1;-Synuclein in Blood</p><p id="p-0118" num="0121">Blood samples from four healthy volunteers were collected into both EDTA- and heparin-containing tubes and plasma samples were prepared. The plasma was initially diluted 2-fold with 1M guanidine for a final concentration of 0.5 M guanidine. Samples were assayed in 1H7/5C12 ELISA assay using the standard buffer of 0.25% casein, 0.5 M guanidine, and protease inhibitors plus 300 &#x3bc;g/ml mouse IgG (added to prevent interference from a human anti-mouse response that can be quite common in patient samples).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0122">Plasma from the EDTA collection gave excellent spike and recovery of &#x3b1;-synuclein. The amount of synuclein varied almost 2-fold between patients. The amount of synuclein in the heparin collected plasma was up to 10-fold lower than that of the EDTA collected plasma. Not only was the total &#x3b1;-synuclein concentration lower but so was the spike and recovery indicating that heparin interferes with the assay possibly by binding to synuclein. In all further experiments, EDTA collection tubes were used.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0123">The presence of synuclein in the plasma indicates that it is produced in cells from the blood. Secretion is unlikely because synuclein is not a secreted protein. Release during cell breakage is more likely. Which cells in the blood, i.e. white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), and platelets produce synuclein was investigated. To prepare WBC, whole blood was spun down at 1000&#xd7;g and the plasma removed. The packed cell pellet was washed two times at 300&#xd7;g to remove any platelet contamination. The RBC were lysed in de-ionized water for 1 minute and the sample was readjusted to 1&#xd7;PBS. There was a small amount of RBC contamination. The resulting pellet was homogenized in 5 M guanidine, diluted 1/10 in assay buffer, treated with DNAse, and then spun in the microfuge to remove insoluble material.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0124">In an alternate fractionation, blood was processed to generate total blood cells, platelets and plasma. The blood was spun at 350&#xd7;g to pellet cells but not platelets. The plasma was removed and spun at 1000&#xd7;g to remove platelets. The cell pellet was washed two times at 350&#xd7;g to remove any remaining platelets. Both plasma and cells were initially diluted/homogenized in 5 M guanidine. The cell pellet was further diluted 1:10, treated with DNAse and spun to remove insoluble material.

Thus by subtractive analysis, greater than 99% of the synuclein in blood resides in the RBC, with most of the remaining synuclein residing in the platelets. Less than 1% of the synuclein was phosphorylated in the 1H7/11A5 assay. The spike and recoveries were very good in all but the WBC prep. The absorption of synuclein by 1H7-conjugated Sepharose was not as robust as in the previous experiment but nonetheless indicated that the majority of the ELISA signal could be removed with a synuclein-specific antibody and therefore was likely due to synuclein.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0129">The large amount of synuclein in RBC makes it difficult to accurately assess the amount of synuclein in plasma and WBC. A minor amount of contamination or lysis of RBC will greatly elevate the concentration found in these compartments. Platelets are difficult to work with in a clinical setting since all manipulations must be done within several hours of blood collection. In addition, platelets are notorious for activating even under the best of assay circumstances. Therefore the most practical measure of synuclein in blood is from total blood cells.</p><?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US07674599-20100309-S00001.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US07674599-20100309-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US07674599-20100309-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US07674599-20100309-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US07674599-20100309-C00002.MOL"/><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text>1.
