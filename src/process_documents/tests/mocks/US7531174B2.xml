More particularly, the invention relates to antibodies which bind to and modulate the signaling of Cripto, kits comprising such antibodies, and methods which use the antibodies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cripto is a cell surface protein of 188 amino acid residues serendipitously isolated in a cDNA screen of a human embryonic carcinoma library (Ciccodicola et al., 1989, EMBO J., vol. 8, no. 7, pp. 1987-1991). The Cripto protein has at least two notable domains: a cysteine-rich domain, and a domain first characterized as similar to the domain found in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family. Cripto was originally classified as a member of the EGF family (Ciccodicola et al., supra); however, subsequent analysis showed that Cripto did not bind any of the known EGF receptors and its EGF-like domain was actually divergent from the EGF family (Bianco et al., 1999, J. Biol. Chem., 274:8624-8629).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Cripto signaling pathway has remained elusive despite continued investigation, with the literature supporting activation of several different pathways, including a MAP kinase pathway (DeSantis et al., 1997, Cell Growth Differ., 8:1257-1266; Kannan et al., 1997, J. Biol. Chem., 272:3330-3335), the TGF-&#x3b2; pathway (Gritsman et al., 1999, Development, 127:921-932; Schier et al., 2000, Nature, 403:385-389), possible interactions with the Wnt pathway (Salomon et al., Endocr Relat Cancer. 2000 December;7(4):199-226; and cross talk with the EGF pathway (Bianco et al., 1999, J. Biol. Chem., 274:8624-8629).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 5,256,643 and two divisional applications related thereto (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,654,140 and 5,792,616), disclose a human Cripto gene, Cripto protein, and antibodies to Cripto.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,557 and three divisional applications related thereto (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,620,866, 5,650,285, and 5,854,399), disclose a human Cripto-related gene and protein. Also disclosed are antibodies which bind to the Cripto-related protein but do not cross react by binding to the Cripto protein itself.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Cripto protein overexpression is associated with many tumor types (including but not limited to breast, testicular, colon, lung, ovary, bladder, uterine, cervical, pancreatic, and stomach), as demonstrated by immunostaining of human tissue with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against small cripto peptides. Panico et al., 1996, Int. J. Cancer, 65: 51-56; Byrne et al., 1998, J Pathology, 185:108-111; De Angelis et al., 1999, Int J Oncology, 14:437-440. The art is therefore in need of means of controlling, restricting, and/or preventing such overexpression, modulating Cripto signaling, and modulating the consequences of Cripto expression (i.e., promotion and/or maintenance of cell transformation).</p><?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the response of the NCCIT, human testicular carcinoma cell line, to anti-CFC blocking Cripto mAb A8G3.5.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the response of the NCCIT, human testicular carcinoma cell line, to anti-EGF blocking Cripto mAb A27F6.1.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts the results of the FACS analysis showing 293/ALK4 cells binding CR-Fc.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides novel antibodies which specifically bind to Cripto, and methods of making and using such antibodies.

Various classes of antibodies that specifically bind to Cripto have been discovered, including, for example, antibodies that specifically bind to an epitope in the ligand/receptor binding domain of either a native Cripto protein or a denatured form of Cripto; antibodies that bind an EGF-like domain, a cys-rich domain, or a peptide (e.g., from about 3 to about 20 amino acids) from the region comprising amino acid residues 46 to 150; antibodies that bind Cripto and modulate Cripto signalling; antibodies that bind Cripto and modulate tumor cell growth; and antibodies that bind to Cripto, modulate Cripto signaling, and modulate tumor cell growth. These antibodies are selected using conventional in vitro assays for selecting antibodies which bind the ligand/receptor binding domain, modulate Cripto signaling, or modulate tumor cell growth.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The methods of this invention are useful in the therapy of malignant or benign tumors of mammals where the growth rate of the tumor (which is an abnormal rate for the normal tissue) is at least partially dependent upon Cripto. Abnormal growth rate is a rate of growth which is in excess of that required for normal homeostasis and is in excess of that for normal tissues of the same origin.</p><p id="h-0007" num="0000">Definitions</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Various definitions are made throughout this document. Most words have the meaning that would be attributed to those words by one skilled in the art. Words specifically defined either below or elsewhere in this document have the meaning provided in the context of the present invention as a whole and as are typically understood by those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As used herein, the term &#x201c;region&#x201d; means a physically contiguous portion of the primary structure of a biomolecule. In the case of proteins, a region is defined by a contiguous portion of the amino acid sequence of that protein.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As used herein, the term &#x201c;domain&#x201d; refers to a structural part of a biomolecule that contributes to a known or suspected function of the biomolecule. Domains may be co-extensive with regions or portions thereof; domains may also incorporate a portion of a biomolecule that is distinct from a particular region, in addition to all or part of that region. Examples of protein domains include, but are not limited to the extracellular domain (spans from about residue 31 to about residue 188 of Cripto, including Cripto, CR-1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and CR-3 (SEQ ID NO:2)) and transmembrane domain (spans from about residue 169 to about residue 188 of Cripto, including Cripto, CR-1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and CR-3 (SEQ ID NO:2)). A ligand/receptor binding domain of the Cripto protein spans from about residue 75 to about residue 150 of Cripto, including Cripto, CR-1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and CR-3 (SEQ ID NO:2) and includes the EGF-like domain of Cripto, which spans, for example, from about residue 75 to about residue 112 of Cripto, including Cripto, CR-1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and CR-3 (SEQ ID NO:2) and the cysteine-rich domain of Cripto, which spans, for example, from about residue 114 to about residue 150 of Cripto, including Cripto, CR-1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and CR-3 (SEQ ID NO:2). For example, many monoclonal antibodies of the present invention have been identified as binding to the EGF-like or cys-rich domains. Additionally monoclonal antibody A10B2.18 (ATCC ACCESSION NO. PTA-3311), B3F6.17 (ATCC ACCESSION NO. PTA-3319) and A17A2.16 have been identified as binding to an epitope formed in a domain in the region spanning amino acid residues 46-62, upstream of the EGF-like domain. See Example 3 below. An epitope in the ligand/receptor binding domain is an epitope, whether formed in the conformational native Cripto protein, or the denatured Cripto protein, to which antibodies may bind.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; is meant to refer to complete, intact antibodies, and Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab)2, and other fragments thereof. Complete, intact antibodies include, but are not limited to, monoclonal antibodies such as murine monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, chimeric antibodies, human antibodies, and humanized antibodies. Various forms of antibodies may be produced using standard recombinant DNA techniques (Winter and Milstein, Nature 349: 293-99, 1991). For example, &#x201c;chimeric&#x201d; antibodies may be constructed, in which the antigen binding domain from an animal antibody is linked to a human constant domain (an antibody derived initially from a nonhuman mammal in which recombinant DNA technology has been used to replace all or part of the hinge and constant regions of the heavy chain and/or the constant region of the light chain, with corresponding regions from a human immunoglobulin light chain or heavy chain) (see, e.g., Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81: 6851-55, 1984). Chimeric antibodies reduce the immunogenic responses elicited by animal antibodies when used in human clinical treatments.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, recombinant &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibodies may be synthesized. Humanized antibodies are antibodies initially derived from a nonhuman mammal in which recombinant DNA technology has been used to substitute some or all of the amino acids not required for antigen binding with amino acids from corresponding regions of a human immunoglobulin light or heavy chain. That is, they are chimeras comprising mostly human immunoglobulin sequences into which the regions responsible for specific antigen-binding have been inserted (see, e.g., PCT patent application WO 94/04679). Animals are immunized with the desired antigen, the corresponding antibodies are isolated and the portion of the variable region sequences responsible for specific antigen binding are removed. The animal-derived antigen binding regions are then cloned into the appropriate position of the human antibody genes in which the antigen binding regions have been deleted. Humanized antibodies minimize the use of heterologous (inter-species) sequences in antibodies for use in human therapies, and are less likely to elicit unwanted immune responses. Primatized antibodies can be produced similarly.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another embodiment of the invention includes the use of human antibodies, which can be produced in nonhuman animals, such as transgenic animals harboring one or more human immunoglobulin transgenes. Such animals may be used as a source for splenocytes for producing hybridomas, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,825.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Antibody fragments and univalent antibodies may also be used in the methods and compositions of this invention. Univalent antibodies comprise a heavy chain/light chain dimer bound to the Fc (or stem) region of a second heavy chain. &#x201c;Fab region&#x201d; refers to those portions of the chains which are roughly equivalent, or analogous, to the sequences which comprise the Y branch portions of the heavy chain and to the light chain in its entirety, and which collectively (in aggregates) have been shown to exhibit antibody activity. A Fab protein includes aggregates of one heavy and one light chain (commonly known as Fab&#x2032;), as well as tetramers which correspond to the two branch segments of the antibody Y, (commonly known as F(ab)2), whether any of the above are covalently or non-covalently aggregated, so long as the aggregation is capable of specifically reacting with a particular antigen or antigen family.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Any of the antibodies of the invention may optionally be conjugated to a chemotherapeutic, as defined below.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As used herein, the term &#x201c;binding&#x201d; means the physical or chemical interaction between two proteins or compounds or associated proteins or compounds or combinations thereof, including the interaction between an antibody and a protein. Binding includes ionic, non-ionic, hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals, hydrophobic interactions, etc. The physical interaction, the binding, can be either direct or indirect, indirect being through or due to the effects of another protein or compound. Direct binding refers to interactions that do not take place through or due to the effect of another protein or compound but instead are without other substantial chemical intermediates. Binding may be detected in many different manners. Methods of detecting binding are well-known to those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As used herein, &#x201c;an antibody capable of internalizing Cripto&#x201d; means an antibody which enters the cell while removing Cripto from the cell surface. One can screen for Cripto antibodies which are capable of internalizing Cripto by using fluorescent labeled Cripto monoclonal antibodies. In order to determine which antibodies internalize into the Cripto positive cells one can assay for the uptake of the fluorescent signal of the antibodies into the cells by viewing the cells under a fluorescent and/or confocal microscope. Those antibodies that get internalized will be seen as fluorescent signals in the cytoplasmic and or cellular vesicles. Non-limiting examples of Cripto antibodies capable of internalizing Cripto include A27F6.1 and B3F6.17.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein, the term &#x201c;compound&#x201d; means any identifiable chemical or molecule, including, but not limited to, ion, atom, small molecule, peptide, protein, sugar, nucleotide, or nucleic acid, and such compound can be natural or synthetic.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;modulates&#x201d; or &#x201c;modifies&#x201d; means an increase or decrease in the amount, quality, or effect of a particular activity or protein.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As used herein, the term &#x201c;modulate Cripto signaling&#x201d; means an increase or decrease in the amount, quality, or effect of Cripto activity, by about 5%, preferably 10%, more preferably 20%, more preferably 30%, more preferably 40%, more preferably 50%, more preferably 60%, more preferably 70%, more preferably 80%, more preferably 90%, and most preferably 100%,. Activity may be measured by assays known in the art, such as the null cell assay shown in Example 3.

When used in in vivo therapy, the antibodies of the subject invention are administered to a patient in effective amounts. As used herein an &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; is an amount sufficient to effect beneficial or desired clinical results (i.e., amounts that eliminate or reduce the patient's tumor burden). An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective amount of the antibodies of the present invention is an amount of the antibodies that is sufficient to ameliorate, stabilize, or delay the development of the Cripto-associated disease state, particularly Cripto-associated tumors. Detection and measurement of these indicators of efficacy are discussed below. An example of a typical treatment regime includes administering by intravenous infusion to the subject antibodies of the invention on a weekly schedule, at a dose of about 2-5 mg/kg.

The EGF-like domain spans from about amino acid residue 75 to about amino acid residue 112 of the mature Cripto protein. Epitopes in the EGF-like domain may comprise linear or nonlinear spans of amino acid residues. Example of linear epitopes contemplated include but are not limited to about residues 75-85, 80-90, 85-95, 90-100, 95-105, 100-110, or 105-112.

The cys-rich domain spans from about amino acid residue 114 to about amino acid residue 150 of the mature Cripto protein. Epitopes in the cys-rich domain may comprise linear or nonlinear spans of amino acid residues. Example of linear epitopes contemplated include but are not limited to about residues 114-125, 120-130, 125-135, 130-140, 135-145, or 140-150. In one embodiment, the epitope in the cys-rich domain is an epitope formed in the conformational native Cripto protein versus a denatured Cripto protein</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Once antibodies are generated, binding of the antibodies to Cripto may be assayed using standard techniques known in the art, such as ELISA, while the presence of Cripto on a cell surface may be assayed using flow cytometry (FACS), as shown in Example 2. Any other techniques of measuring such binding may alternatively be used.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The present invention provides antibodies (e.g., monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, single chain antibodies, chimeric antibodies, bifunctional/bispecific antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, and complementary determining region (CDR)-grafted antibodies, including compounds which include CDR sequences which specifically recognize a polypeptide of the invention) specific for Cripto or fragments thereof. Antibody fragments, including Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, and F<sub>v</sub>, are also provided by the invention. The terms &#x201c;specific&#x201d; and &#x201c;selective,&#x201d; when used to describe binding of the antibodies of the invention, indicates that the variable regions of the antibodies of the invention recognize and bind Cripto polypeptides. It will be understood that specific antibodies of the invention may also interact with other proteins (for example, <i>S. aureus </i>protein A or other antibodies in ELISA techniques) through interactions with sequences outside the variable region of the antibodies, and, in particular, in the constant region of the molecule. Screening assays to determine binding specificity of an antibody of the invention (i.e. antibodies that specifically bind to an epitope the ligand/receptor binding domain and the domain spanning amino acid residues 46-62) are well known and routinely practiced in the art. For a comprehensive discussion of such assays, see Harlow et al. (Eds.), <i>Antibodies A Laboratory Manual</i>; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1988), Chapter 6. Antibodies that recognize and bind fragments of Cripto protein are also contemplated, provided that the antibodies are specific for Cripto polypeptides. Antibodies of the invention can be produced using any method well known and routinely practiced in the art.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment, the invention provides an antibody that specifically binds to an epitope in the ligand/receptor binding domain of Cripto. Antibody specificity is described in greater detail below. However, it should be emphasized that antibodies that can be generated from other polypeptides that have previously been described in the literature and that are capable of fortuitously cross-reacting with Cripto (e.g., due to the fortuitous existence of a similar epitope in both polypeptides) are considered &#x201c;cross-reactive&#x201d; antibodies. Such cross-reactive antibodies are not antibodies that are &#x201c;specific&#x201d; for Cripto. The determination of whether an antibody specifically binds to an epitope of Cripto is made using any of several assays, such as Western blotting assays, that are well known in the art. For identifying cells that express Cripto and also for modulating Cripto ligand/receptor binding activity, antibodies that specifically bind to an extracellular epitope of the Cripto protein (i.e., portions of the Cripto protein found outside the cell) are particularly useful.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one embodiment, the invention provides a cell-free composition comprising polyclonal antibodies, wherein at least one of the antibodies is an antibody of the invention specific for Cripto. Antisera isolated from an animal is an exemplary composition, as is a composition comprising an antibody fraction of an antisera that has been resuspended in water or in another diluent, excipient, or carrier.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In another embodiment, the invention provides monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Further in contrast to polyclonal preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different epitopes, each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. Monoclonal antibodies are useful to improve selectivity and specificity of diagnostic and analytical assay methods using antigen-antibody binding. Another advantage of monoclonal antibodies is that they are synthesized by a hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. Hybridomas that produce such antibodies are also intended as aspects of the invention.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In still another related embodiment, the invention provides an anti-idiotypic antibody specific for an antibody that is specific for Cripto. For a more detailed discussion of anti-idiotypic antibodies, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,063,379 and 5,780,029.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">It is well known that antibodies contain relatively small antigen binding domains that can be isolated chemically or by recombinant techniques. Such domains are useful Cripto binding molecules themselves, and also may be reintroduced into human antibodies, or fused to a chemotherapeutic or polypeptide. Thus, in still another embodiment, the invention provides a polypeptide comprising a fragment of a Cripto-specific antibody, wherein the fragment and associated molecule, if any, bind to the Cripto. By way of non-limiting example, the invention provides polypeptides that are single chain antibodies and CDR-grafted antibodies. For a more detailed discussion of CDR-grafted antibodies, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,859,205.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In another embodiment, non-human antibodies may be humanized by any of the methods known in the art. Humanized antibodies are useful for in vivo therapeutic applications. In addition, recombinant &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibodies may be synthesized. Humanized antibodies are antibodies initially derived from a nonhuman mammal in which recombinant DNA technology has been used to substitute some or all of the amino acids not required for antigen binding with amino acids from corresponding regions of a human immunoglobulin light or heavy chain. That is, they are chimeras comprising mostly human immunoglobulin sequences into which the regions responsible for specific antigen-binding have been inserted (see, e.g., PCT patent application WO 94/04679). Animals are immunized with the desired antigen, the corresponding antibodies are isolated and the portion of the variable region sequences responsible for specific antigen binding are removed. The animal-derived antigen binding regions are then cloned into the appropriate position of the human antibody genes in which the antigen binding regions have been deleted. Humanized antibodies minimize the use of heterologous (inter-species) sequences in antibodies for use in human therapies, and are less likely to elicit unwanted immune responses. Primatized antibodies can be produced similarly using primate (e.g., rhesus, baboon and chimpanzee) antibody genes. Further changes can then be introduced into the antibody framework to modulate affinity or immunogenicity. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,585,089, 5,693,761, 5,693,762, and 6,180,370.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Another embodiment of the invention includes the use of human antibodies, which can be produced in nonhuman animals, such as transgenic animals harboring one or more human immunoglobulin transgenes. Such animals may be used as a source for splenocytes for producing hybridomas, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,825, WO00076310, WO00058499 and WO00037504 and incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Signal Modulation</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In another embodiment, the antibodies of the invention bind to Cripto, and modulate Cripto signaling or Cripto-protein interactions. Over-expression of Cripto activity can lead to a de-differentiated state promoting mesenchymal cell characteristics, increased proliferation, and cell migration (Salomon et al., BioEssays 21: 61-70, 1999; Ciardiello et al., Oncogene 9: 291-298, 1994; and Baldassarre et al., Int. J. Cancer 66:538-543, 1996), phenotypes associated with cell transformation seen in neoplasia.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">One method of testing the activity of anti-Cripto antibodies and their ability to modulate Cripto signaling is with an F9-Cripto knock-out (KO) cell line (Minchiotti at al., Mech. Dev. 90: 133-142, 2000). Cripto stimulates smad2 phosphorylation and the transcription factor FAST in Xenopus embryos, and the activity of the transcription factor FAST can be monitored by measuring the luciferase activity from a FAST regulatory element-luciferase reporter gene (Saijoh et al., Mol. Cell 5:35-47, 2000). F9-Cripto KO cells are deleted for the Cripto gene and are thus null for Cripto and Cripto-dependent signaling (Minchiotti at al., Mech. Dev. 90: 133-142, 2000). Cripto signaling can be assessed in the F9 Cripto KO cells by transfecting in Cripto, FAST, and the FAST regulatory element-luciferase gene construct. No Cripto dependent FAST luciferase activity will be seen in these cell lines unless Cripto cDNA, and FAST cDNA is transfected into them. Antibodies capable of blocking Cripto-dependent Nodal signaling are antibodies that block Cripto signaling function.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Other assays capable of measuring the activity of Cripto can be employed by those of skill in the art, such as a growth in soft agar assay (see Example 4 below). The ability of cells to grow in soft agar is associated with cell transformation and the assay is a classical in vitro assay for measuring inhibition of tumor cell growth. Other assays useful in determining inhibition of activity include in vitro assays on plastic, and the like.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Therapeutic Uses</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Antibodies of the invention are also useful for, therapeutic purposes, such as modulation of tumor cell growth, diagnostic purposes to detect or quantitate Cripto, and purification of Cripto.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In one embodiment of the invention, antibodies are provided which are capable of binding specifically to Cripto and which modulate growth of tumor cells in a patient.

In the first fusion, primary supernatants were also screened for their ability to recognize cell surface Cripto protein on the testicular tumor cell line, NCCIT by FACS. In the case of the second fusion, the ability of supernatants to recognize Cripto on two tumor cell lines, NCCIT and the breast cancer line, DU4475 by FACs was analyzed. Secondary screens included testing the monoclonal antibody supernatant's ability to recognize cell surface Cripto on a panel of tumor cell lines (see Tables 1 and 2 for results), ability of monoclonal antibodies to recognize human Cripto immunohistochemically on human breast and colon tumor tissue sections, ability of monoclonal antibodies to block in Cripto-Nodal signalling assay, ability to block growth of tumor cell lines on plastic or in soft agar assays, and ability to internalize cell surface Cripto.</p><p id="h-0016" num="0000">C.

The transfected cells were then selected in puromycin until colonies formed. Colonies were then picked, expanded and then analyzed for Alk4 expression using western blotting analysis for HA. Clone 21 (293-Alk4-21) was found to express high levels of Alk4 compared to control, untransfected 293 cells.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0151">To analyze Cripto-Alk4 binding by flow cytometry, a purified, soluble form of human Cripto (aa 1-169) fused to the Fc portion of human IgG (CrdelC-Fc) was employed.

The cells were then washed in FACS buffer and the bound Fc protein was detected by incubating the cells with a R-phycoerytherin-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Fc fragment specific) from Jackson Immunologics. Samples were then washed again, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and analyzed using standard flow cytometry procedures.
