FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The instant disclosure relates to antibodies that specifically bind to human PD-1 and methods of using the same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The protein programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an inhibitory member of the CD28 family of receptors. PD-1 is expressed on activated B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells (Agata et al. (1996) Int Immunol 8:765-72; Okazaki et al. (2002) Curr. Opin. Immunol. 14: 391779-82; Bennett et al. (2003) J Immunol 170:711-8). PD-1 is a 55 kDa type I transmembrane protein that is part of the Ig gene superfamily and contains a membrane proximal immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibitory motif (ITIM) and a membrane distal tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM) (Thomas, M. L. (1995) J Exp Med 181:1953-6; Vivier, E and Daeron, M (1997) Immunol Today 18:286-91). Two ligands for PD-1 have been identified, PD-L1 and PD-L2, that have been shown to downregulate T cell activation upon binding to PD-1 (Freeman et al. (2000) J Exp Med 192:1027-34; Latchman et al. (2001) Nat Immunol 2:261-8; Carter et al. (2002) Eur J Immunol 32:634-43). PD-L1 is abundant in a variety of human cancers (Dong et al. (2002) Nat. Med. 8:787-9). The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 results in a decrease in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, a decrease in T cell receptor mediated proliferation, and immune evasion by the cancerous cells (Dong et al. (2003) J. Mol. Med. 81:281-7; Blank et al. (2005) Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 54:307-314; Konishi et al. (2004) Clin. Cancer Res. 10:5094-100). This immune suppression can be reversed by inhibiting the local interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1, and the effect is additive when the interaction of PD-1 with PD-L2 is blocked as well (Iwai et al. (2002) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 99:12293-7; Brown et al. (2003) J. Immunol. 170:1257-66).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">PD-1 is an immune cell inhibitory molecule. PD-1 deficient animals develop various autoimmune phenotypes, including autoimmune cardiomyopathy and a lupus-like syndrome with arthritis and nephritis (Nishimura et al. (1999) Immunity 11:141-51; Nishimura et al. (2001) Science 291:319-22). Additionally, PD-1 has been found to play a role in autoimmune encephalomyelitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), type I diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis (Salama et al. (2003) J Exp Med 198:71-78; Prokunina and Alarcon-Riquelme (2004) Hum Mol Genet 13:R143; Nielsen et al. (2004) Lupus 13:510). In a murine B cell tumor line, the ITSM of PD-1 was shown to be essential to block BCR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-flux and tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream effector molecules (Okazaki et al. (2001) PNAS 98:13866-71).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Given the role of human PD-1 in modulating immune responses, therapeutic agents designed to antagonize PD-1 signaling hold great promise for the treatment of diseases that involve PD-1-mediated immune suppression.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">3.

The variable region typically refers to a portion of an antibody, generally, a portion of a light or heavy chain, typically about the amino-terminal 110 to 125 amino acids in the mature heavy chain and about 90 to 115 amino acids in the mature light chain, which differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. The variability in sequence is concentrated in those regions called complementarity determining regions (CDRs) while the more highly conserved regions in the variable domain are called framework regions (FR). In certain embodiments, the variable region is a human variable region. In certain embodiments, the variable region comprises rodent or murine CDRs and human framework regions (FRs). In particular embodiments, the variable region is a primate (e.g., non-human primate) variable region. In certain embodiments, the variable region comprises rodent or murine CDRs and primate (e.g., non-human primate) framework regions (FRs).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The terms &#x201c;VL&#x201d; and &#x201c;VL domain&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to the light chain variable region of an antibody.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The terms &#x201c;VH&#x201d; and &#x201c;VH domain&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to the heavy chain variable region of an antibody.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;constant region&#x201d; and &#x201c;constant domain&#x201d; are interchangeable and are common in the art. The constant region is an antibody portion, e.g., a carboxyl terminal portion of a light and/or heavy chain which is not directly involved in binding of an antibody to antigen but which can exhibit various effector functions, such as interaction with an Fc receptor (e.g., Fc gamma receptor). The constant region of an immunoglobulin molecule generally has a more conserved amino acid sequence relative to an immunoglobulin variable domain.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">As used herein, the term &#x201c;heavy chain&#x201d; when used in reference to an antibody can refer to any distinct type, e.g., alpha (&#x3b1;), delta (&#x3b4;), epsilon (&#x3b5;), gamma (&#x3b3;), and mu (&#x3bc;), based on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain, which give rise to IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM classes of antibodies, respectively, including subclasses of IgG, e.g., IgG<sub>1</sub>, IgG<sub>2</sub>, IgG<sub>3</sub>, and IgG<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">As used herein, the term &#x201c;light chain&#x201d; when used in reference to an antibody can refer to any distinct type, e.g., kappa (&#x3ba;) or lambda (&#x3bb;) based on the amino acid sequence of the constant domains. Light chain amino acid sequences are well known in the art. In specific embodiments, the light chain is a human light chain.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">&#x201c;Binding affinity&#x201d; generally refers to the strength of the sum total of non-covalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, &#x201c;binding affinity&#x201d; refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). Affinity can be measured and/or expressed in a number of ways known in the art, including, but not limited to, equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>), and equilibrium association constant (K<sub>A</sub>). The K<sub>D </sub>is calculated from the quotient of k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>, whereas K<sub>A </sub>is calculated from the quotient of k<sub>on</sub>/k<sub>off</sub>. k<sub>on </sub>refers to the association rate constant of, e.g., an antibody to an antigen, and k<sub>off </sub>refers to the dissociation rate constant of, e.g., an antibody to an antigen. The k<sub>on </sub>and k<sub>off </sub>can be determined by techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as BIAcore&#xae; or KinExA.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">As used herein, the term &#x201c;specifically binds to&#x201d; refers to the ability of an antibody to bind to an antigen with a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of at least about 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>M, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M, m 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;11 </sup>M, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>M, or less, and/or bind to an antigen with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for a nonspecific antigen. In one embodiment, a molecule that specifically binds to an antigen can bind to other peptides or polypeptides, generally with lower affinity as determined by, e.g., immunoassays, BIAcore&#xae;, KinExA 3000 instrument (Sapidyne Instruments, Boise, Id.), or other assays known in the art. In one embodiment, a molecule that specifically binds to an antigen binds to the antigen with an association constant (K<sub>A</sub>) that is at least 2 logs, 2.5 logs, 3 logs, 4 logs or greater than the K<sub>A </sub>when the molecule binds non-specifically to another antigen. In one embodiment, a molecule that specifically binds to an antigen binds to the antigen with a K<sub>d </sub>of 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M or less, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M or less, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M or less, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>M or less, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M or less, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;11 </sup>M or less, or 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>M or less.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In another specific embodiment, molecules that specifically bind to an antigen do not cross react with other proteins under similar binding conditions. In another specific embodiment, molecules that specifically bind to PD-1 do not cross react with other non-PD-1 proteins. In a specific embodiment, provided herein is an antibody that binds to PD-1 (e.g., human PD-1) with higher affinity than to another unrelated antigen. In certain embodiments, provided herein is an antibody that binds to PD-1 (e.g., human PD-1) with a 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or higher affinity than to another, unrelated antigen as measured by, e.g., a radioimmunoassay, surface plasmon resonance, or kinetic exclusion assay. In a specific embodiment, the extent of binding of an anti-PD-1 antibody described herein to an unrelated, non-PD-1 protein is less than 10%, 15%, or 20% of the binding of the antibody to PD-1 protein as measured by, e.g., a radioimmunoassay.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">As used herein, an &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; is a term in the art and refers to a localized region of an antigen to which an antibody can specifically bind. An epitope can be, for example, contiguous amino acids of a polypeptide (linear or contiguous epitope) or an epitope can, for example, come together from two or more non-contiguous regions of a polypeptide or polypeptides (conformational, non-linear, discontinuous, or non-contiguous epitope). In certain embodiments, the epitope to which an antibody binds can be determined by, e.g., NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction crystallography studies, ELISA assays, hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (e.g., liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry), array-based oligo-peptide scanning assays (e.g., constraining peptides using CLIPS (Chemical Linkage of Peptides onto Scaffolds) to map discontinuous or conformational epitopes), and/or mutagenesis mapping (e.g., site-directed mutagenesis mapping). For X-ray crystallography, crystallization may be accomplished using any of the known methods in the art (e.g., Gieg&#xe9; R et al., (1994) Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 50(Pt 4): 339-350; McPherson A (1990) Eur J Biochem 189: 1-23; Chayen N E (1997) Structure 5: 1269-1274; McPherson A (1976) J Biol Chem 251: 6300-6303, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Antibody:antigen crystals may be studied using well known X-ray diffraction techniques and may be refined using computer software such as X-PLOR (Yale University, 1992, distributed by Molecular Simulations, Inc.; see, e.g., Meth Enzymol (1985) volumes 114 &#x26; 115, eds Wyckoff H W et al.; U.S. 2004/0014194), and BUSTER (Bricogne G (1993) Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 49(Pt 1): 37-60; Bricogne G (1997) Meth Enzymol 276A: 361-423, ed Carter C W; Roversi P et al., (2000) Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 56(Pt 10): 1316-1323, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Mutagenesis mapping studies may be accomplished using any method known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Champe M et al., (1995) J Biol Chem 270: 1388-1394 and Cunningham B C &#x26; Wells J A (1989) Science 244: 1081-1085, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, for a description of mutagenesis techniques, including alanine scanning mutagenesis techniques. CLIPS (Chemical Linkage of Peptides onto Scaffolds) is a technology to present one or more peptides in a structurally constrained configuration to behave as functional mimics of complex protein domains. See, e.g., U.S. Publication Nos. US 2008/0139407 A1 and US 2007/099240 A1, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,972,993, all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. In a specific embodiment, the epitope of an antibody is determined using alanine scanning mutagenesis studies. In a specific embodiment, the epitope of an antibody is determined using hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry. In a specific embodiment, the epitope of an antibody is determined using CLIPS Epitope Mapping Technology from Pepscan Therapeutics.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;T cell receptor&#x201d; and &#x201c;TCR&#x201d; are used interchangeably and refer to full length heterodimeric &#x3b1;&#x3b2; or &#x3b3;&#x3b4; TCRs, antigen-binding fragments of full length TCRs, and molecules comprising TCR CDRs or variable regions. Examples of TCRs include, but are not limited to, full length TCRs, antigen-binding fragments of full length TCRs, soluble TCRs lacking transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions, single-chain TCRs containing variable regions of TCRs attached by a flexible linker, TCR chains linked by an engineered disulfide bond, monospecific TCRs, multi-specific TCRs (including bispecific TCRs), TCR fusions, human TCRs, humanized TCRs, chimeric TCRs, recombinantly produced TCRs, and synthetic TCRs.

The methods of &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; employ administration of an antibody to a subject having a disease or disorder, or predisposed to having such a disease or disorder, in order to prevent, cure, delay, reduce the severity of, or ameliorate one or more symptoms of the disease or disorder or recurring disease or disorder, or in order to prolong the survival of a subject beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">As used herein, the term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; in the context of the administration of a therapy to a subject refers to the amount of a therapy that achieves a desired prophylactic or therapeutic effect.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">As used herein, the term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; includes any human or non-human animal. In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a human or non-human mammal, more preferably a human.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The determination of &#x201c;percent identity&#x201d; between two sequences (e.g., amino acid sequences or nucleic acid sequences) can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A specific, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin S &#x26; Altschul S F (1990) PNAS 87: 2264-2268, modified as in Karlin S &#x26; Altschul S F (1993) PNAS 90: 5873-5877, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul S F et al., (1990) J Mol Biol 215: 403, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST nucleotide program parameters set, e.g., for score=100, wordlength=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules described herein. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program parameters set, e.g., to score 50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecule described herein. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul S F et al., (1997) Nuc Acids Res 25: 3389-3402, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Alternatively, PSI BLAST can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules (Id.). When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI Blast programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., of XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used (see, e.g., National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) on the worldwide web, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Another specific, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller, 1988, CABIOS 4:11-17, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Such an algorithm is incorporated in the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The percent identity between two sequences can be determined using techniques similar to those described above, with or without allowing gaps.

In certain embodiments, the vaccine is a heat shock protein based tumor vaccine or a heat shock protein based pathogen vaccine. In a specific embodiment, an anti-PD-1 antibody disclosed herein is administered to a subject in combination with a heat shock protein based tumor-vaccine. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of highly conserved proteins found ubiquitously across all species. Their expression can be powerfully induced to much higher levels as a result of heat shock or other forms of stress, including exposure to toxins, oxidative stress or glucose deprivation. Five families have been classified according to molecular weight: HSP-110, -90, -70, -60 and -28. HSPs deliver immunogenic peptides through the cross-presentation pathway in antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), leading to T cell activation. HSPs function as chaperone carriers of tumor-associated antigenic peptides forming complexes able to induce tumor-specific immunity. Upon release from dying tumor cells, the HSP-antigen complexes are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) wherein the antigens are processed into peptides that bind MHC class I and class II molecules leading to the activation of anti-tumor CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The immunity elicited by HSP complexes derived from tumor preparations is specifically directed against the unique antigenic peptide repertoire expressed by the cancer of each subject.

As will be appreciated in the art, once the &#x201c;standard&#x201d; PD-1 polypeptide level is known, it can be used repeatedly as a standard for comparison. Therefore, in a further embodiment, the present invention relates to an in vitro method for assaying and/or detecting PD-1 protein levels, in particular human PD-1 protein levels, in a biological sample, comprising qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of PD-1 protein, in particular of human PD-1 protein, in a biological sample, by an immunohistological method.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0254">As used herein, the term &#x201c;biological sample&#x201d; refers to any biological sample obtained from a subject, cell line, tissue, or other source of cells potentially expressing PD-1. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from animals (e.g., humans) are well known in the art. Biological samples include peripheral mononuclear blood cells.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0255">An anti-PD-1 antibody described herein can be used for prognostic, diagnostic, monitoring and screening applications, including in vitro and in vivo applications well known and standard to the skilled artisan and based on the present description. Prognostic, diagnostic, monitoring and screening assays and kits for in vitro assessment and evaluation of immune system status and/or immune response may be utilized to predict, diagnose and monitor to evaluate patient samples including those known to have or suspected of having an immune system-dysfunction or with regard to an anticipated or desired immune system response, antigen response or vaccine response. The assessment and evaluation of immune system status and/or immune response is also useful in determining the suitability of a patient for a clinical trial of a drug or for the administration of a particular chemotherapeutic agent, a radiotherapeutic agent, or an antibody, including combinations thereof, versus a different agent or antibody. This type of prognostic and diagnostic monitoring and assessment is already in practice utilizing antibodies against the HER2 protein in breast cancer (HercepTest&#x2122;, Dako) where the assay is also used to evaluate patients for antibody therapy using Herceptin&#xae;. In vivo applications include directed cell therapy and immune system modulation and radio imaging of immune responses. Therefore, in one embodiment, the present invention relates to an anti-PD-1 antibody, the use of such antibody for preparing a pharmaceutical composition and/or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for use as a diagnostic. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to an anti-PD-1 antibody, the use of such antibody for preparing a pharmaceutical composition and/or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for use in a method for the prediction, diagnosis and/or monitoring of a subject having or suspected to have an immune system-dysfunction and/or with regard to an anticipated or desired immune system response, antigen response or vaccine response. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to the use of anti-PD-1 antibody of the invention, for predicting, diagnosing and/or monitoring of a subject having or suspected to have an immune system-dysfunction and/or with regard to an anticipated or desired immune system response, antigen response or vaccine response by assaying and/or detecting human PD-1 protein levels in a biological sample of the subject in vitro.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0256">In one embodiment, an anti-PD-1 antibody can be used in immunohistochemistry of biopsy samples. Preferably, the method is an in vitro method. In another embodiment, an anti-PD-1 antibody can be used to detect levels of PD-1, or levels of cells which contain PD-1 on their membrane surface, which levels can then be linked to certain disease symptoms. Anti-PD-1 antibodies described herein may carry a detectable or functional label and/or may be conjugated to a radionuclide or detectable label. When fluorescence labels are used, currently available microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (FACS) or combination of both methods procedures known in the art may be utilized to identify and to quantitate the specific binding members. Anti-PD-1 antibodies described herein may carry or may be conjugated to a fluorescence label. Exemplary fluorescence labels include, for example, reactive and conjugated probes, e.g., Aminocoumarin, Fluorescein and Texas red, Alexa Fluor dyes, Cy dyes and DyLight dyes. An anti-PD-1 antibody may carry or may be conjugated to a radioactive label or radionuclide, such as the isotopes <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>36</sup>Cl, <sup>51</sup>Cr, <sup>57</sup>Co, <sup>58</sup>Co, <sup>59</sup>Fe, <sup>67</sup>Cu, <sup>90</sup>Y, <sup>99</sup>Tc, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>117</sup>Lu, <sup>121</sup>I, <sup>124</sup>I, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>198</sup>Au, <sup>211</sup>At, <sup>231</sup>Bi, <sup>225</sup>Ac and <sup>186</sup>Re. When radioactive labels are used, currently available counting procedures known in the art may be utilized to identify and quantitate the specific binding of anti-PD-1 antibody to PD-1 (e.g., human PD-1). In the instance where the label is an enzyme, detection may be accomplished by any of the presently utilized colorimetric, spectrophotometric, fluoro spectrophotometric, amperometric or gasometric techniques as known in the art. This can be achieved by contacting a sample or a control sample with an anti-PD-1 antibody under conditions that allow for the formation of a complex between the antibody and PD-1. Any complexes formed between the antibody and PD-1 are detected and compared in the sample and the control. In light of the specific binding of the antibodies described herein for PD-1, the antibodies can be used to specifically detect PD-1 expression on the surface of cells. The antibodies described herein can also be used to purify PD-1 via immunoaffinity purification. Also included herein is an assay system which may be prepared in the form of a test kit, kit or kit-of-parts for the quantitative analysis of the extent of the presence of, for instance, PD-1 or PD-1/PD-1 ligand complexes.

Provided herein are polynucleotides comprising nucleotide sequences encoding a heavy and/or light chain of any of the antibodies provided herein, as well as vectors comprising such polynucleotide sequences, e.g., expression vectors for their efficient expression in host cells, e.g., mammalian cells.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0258">As used herein, an &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; polynucleotide or nucleic acid molecule is one which is separated from other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source (e.g., in a mouse or a human) of the nucleic acid molecule. Moreover, an &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. For example, the language &#x201c;substantially free&#x201d; includes preparations of polynucleotide or nucleic acid molecule having less than about 15%, 10%, 5%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1% (in particular less than about 10%) of other material, e.g., cellular material, culture medium, other nucleic acid molecules, chemical precursors and/or other chemicals. In a specific embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule(s) encoding an antibody described herein is isolated or purified.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0259">In particular aspects, provided herein are polynucleotides comprising nucleotide sequences encoding antibodies, which specifically bind to a PD-1 polypeptide (e.g., human PD-1) and comprises an amino acid sequence as described herein, as well as antibodies which compete with such antibodies for binding to a PD-1 polypeptide (e.g., in a dose-dependent manner), or which binds to the same epitope as that of such antibodies.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0260">In certain aspects, provided herein are polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding the light chain or heavy chain of an antibody described herein. The polynucleotides can comprise nucleotide sequences encoding a light chain comprising the VL FRs and CDRs of antibodies described herein (see, e.g., Tables 3 and 5) or nucleotide sequences encoding a heavy chain comprising the VH FRs and CDRs of antibodies described herein (see, e.g., Tables 2 and 4).</p><p id="p-0272" num="0261">Also provided herein are polynucleotides encoding an anti-PD-1 antibody that are optimized, e.g., by codon/RNA optimization, replacement with heterologous signal sequences, and elimination of mRNA instability elements. Methods to generate optimized nucleic acids encoding an anti-PD-1 antibody or a fragment thereof (e.g., light chain, heavy chain, VH domain, or VL domain) for recombinant expression by introducing codon changes and/or eliminating inhibitory regions in the mRNA can be carried out by adapting the optimization methods described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,965,726; 6,174,666; 6,291,664; 6,414,132; and 6,794,498, accordingly, all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. For example, potential splice sites and instability elements (e.g., A/T or A/U rich elements) within the RNA can be mutated without altering the amino acids encoded by the nucleic acid sequences to increase stability of the RNA for recombinant expression. The alterations utilize the degeneracy of the genetic code, e.g., using an alternative codon for an identical amino acid. In some embodiments, it can be desirable to alter one or more codons to encode a conservative mutation, e.g., a similar amino acid with similar chemical structure and properties and/or function as the original amino acid. Such methods can increase expression of an anti-PD-1 antibody or fragment thereof by at least 1 fold, 2 fold, 3 fold, 4 fold, 5 fold, 10 fold, 20 fold, 30 fold, 40 fold, 50 fold, 60 fold, 70 fold, 80 fold, 90 fold, or 100 fold or more relative to the expression of an anti-PD-1 antibody encoded by polynucleotides that have not been optimized.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0262">In certain embodiments, an optimized polynucleotide sequence encoding an anti-PD-1 antibody described herein or a fragment thereof (e.g., VL domain and/or VH domain) can hybridize to an antisense (e.g., complementary) polynucleotide of an unoptimized polynucleotide sequence encoding an anti-PD-1 antibody described herein or a fragment thereof (e.g., VL domain and/or VH domain). In specific embodiments, an optimized nucleotide sequence encoding an anti-PD-1 antibody described herein or a fragment hybridizes under high stringency conditions to antisense polynucleotide of an unoptimized polynucleotide sequence encoding an anti-PD-1 antibody described herein or a fragment thereof. In a specific embodiment, an optimized nucleotide sequence encoding an anti-PD-1 antibody described herein or a fragment thereof hybridizes under high stringency, intermediate or lower stringency hybridization conditions to an antisense polynucleotide of an unoptimized nucleotide sequence encoding an anti-PD-1 antibody described herein or a fragment thereof.

Nucleotide sequences encoding antibodies described herein, e.g., antibodies described in Tables 1-6, and modified versions of these antibodies can be determined using methods well known in the art, i.e., nucleotide codons known to encode particular amino acids are assembled in such a way to generate a nucleic acid that encodes the antibody. Such a polynucleotide encoding the antibody can be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides (e.g., as described in Kutmeier G et al., (1994), BioTechniques 17: 242-6, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), which, briefly, involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody, annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides, and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0264">Alternatively, a polynucleotide encoding an antibody described herein can be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source (e.g., a hybridoma) using methods well known in the art (e.g., PCR and other molecular cloning methods). For example, PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032; ends of a known sequence can be performed using genomic DNA obtained from hybridoma cells producing the antibody of interest. Such PCR amplification methods can be used to obtain nucleic acids comprising the sequence encoding the light chain and/or heavy chain of an antibody. Such PCR amplification methods can be used to obtain nucleic acids comprising the sequence encoding the variable light chain region and/or the variable heavy chain region of an antibody. The amplified nucleic acids can be cloned into vectors for expression in host cells and for further cloning, for example, to generate chimeric and humanized antibodies.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0265">If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available, but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known, a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin can be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source (e.g., an antibody cDNA library or a cDNA library generated from, or nucleic acid, preferably poly A+ RNA, isolated from, any tissue or cells expressing the antibody, such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody described herein) by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032; ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify, e.g., a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR can then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0266">DNA encoding anti-PD-1 antibodies described herein can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the anti-PD-1 antibodies). Hybridoma cells can serve as a source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as <i>E. coli </i>cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (e.g., CHO cells from the CHO GS System&#x2122; (Lonza)), or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of anti-PD-1 antibodies in the recombinant host cells.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0267">To generate whole antibodies, PCR primers including VH or VL nucleotide sequences, a restriction site, and a flanking sequence to protect the restriction site can be used to amplify the VH or VL sequences in scFv clones. Utilizing cloning techniques known to those of skill in the art, the PCR amplified VH domains can be cloned into vectors expressing a heavy chain constant region, e.g., the human gamma 4 constant region, and the PCR amplified VL domains can be cloned into vectors expressing a light chain constant region, e.g., human kappa or lambda constant regions. In certain embodiments, the vectors for expressing the VH or VL domains comprise an EF-1&#x3b1; promoter, a secretion signal, a cloning site for the variable region, constant domains, and a selection marker such as neomycin. The VH and VL domains can also be cloned into one vector expressing the necessary constant regions. The heavy chain conversion vectors and light chain conversion vectors are then co-transfected into cell lines to generate stable or transient cell lines that express full-length antibodies, e.g., IgG, using techniques known to those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0268">The DNA also can be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the murine sequences, or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0269">Also provided are polynucleotides that hybridize under high stringency, intermediate or lower stringency hybridization conditions to polynucleotides that encode an antibody described herein.

For example, hybridization under stringent conditions can involve hybridization to filter-bound DNA in 6&#xd7; sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45&#xb0; C. followed by one or more washes in 0.2&#xd7;SSC/0.1% SDS at about 50-65&#xb0; C.; hybridization under highly stringent conditions can involve hybridization to filter-bound nucleic acid in 6&#xd7;SSC at about 45&#xb0; C. followed by one or more washes in 0.1&#xd7;SSC/0.2% SDS at about 68&#xb0; C. Hybridization under other stringent hybridization conditions are known to those of skill in the art and have been described, see, for example, Ausubel F M et al., eds., (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. I, Green Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc., New York at pages 6.3.1-6.3.6 and 2.10.3, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0271">In certain aspects, provided herein are cells (e.g., host cells) expressing (e.g., recombinantly) antibodies described herein which specifically bind to PD-1 (e.g., human PD-1) and related polynucleotides and expression vectors. Provided herein are vectors (e.g., expression vectors) comprising polynucleotides comprising nucleotide sequences encoding anti-PD-1 antibodies or a fragment for recombinant expression in host cells, preferably in mammalian cells. Also provided herein are host cells comprising such vectors for recombinantly expressing anti-PD-1 antibodies described herein (e.g., human or humanized antibody). In a particular aspect, provided herein are methods for producing an antibody described herein, comprising expressing such antibody from a host cell.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0272">Recombinant expression of an antibody described herein (e.g., a full-length antibody, heavy and/or light chain of an antibody, or a single chain antibody described herein) that specifically binds to PD-1 (e.g., human PD-1) involves construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule, heavy and/or light chain of an antibody, or a fragment thereof (e.g., heavy and/or light chain variable regions) described herein has been obtained, the vector for the production of the antibody molecule can be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus, methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., light chain or heavy chain) encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., light chain or heavy chain) coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. Also provided are replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule described herein, a heavy or light chain of an antibody, a heavy or light chain variable region of an antibody or a fragment thereof, or a heavy or light chain CDR, operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors can, for example, include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule (see, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 86/05807 and WO 89/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties) and variable regions of the antibody can be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy, the entire light chain, or both the entire heavy and light chains.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0273">An expression vector can be transferred to a cell (e.g., host cell) by conventional techniques and the resulting cells can then be cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody described herein or a fragment thereof. Thus, provided herein are host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody described herein or fragments thereof, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or fragment thereof, or a single chain antibody described herein, operably linked to a promoter for expression of such sequences in the host cell. In certain embodiments, for the expression of double-chained antibodies, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains, individually, can be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below. In certain embodiments, a host cell contains a vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding both the heavy chain and light chain of an antibody described herein, or a fragment thereof. In specific embodiments, a host cell contains two different vectors, a first vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a heavy chain or a heavy chain variable region of an antibody described herein, or a fragment thereof, and a second vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a light chain or a light chain variable region of an antibody described herein, or a fragment thereof. In other embodiments, a first host cell comprises a first vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a heavy chain or a heavy chain variable region of an antibody described herein, or a fragment thereof, and a second host cell comprises a second vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a light chain or a light chain variable region of an antibody described herein.

No. 5,807,715, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest can be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which can, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express an antibody molecule described herein in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., <i>E. coli </i>and <i>B. subtilis</i>) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; yeast (e.g., <i>Saccharomyces Pichia</i>) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing antibody coding sequences; plant cell systems (e.g., green algae such as <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>) infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing antibody coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS (e.g., COS1 or COS), CHO, BHK, MDCK, HEK 293, NS0, PER.C6, VERO, CRL7O3O, HsS78Bst, HeLa, and NIH 3T3, HEK-293T, HepG2, SP210, R1.1, B-W, L-M, BSC1, BSC40, YB/20 and BMT10 cells) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter). In a specific embodiment, cells for expressing antibodies described herein are CHO cells, for example CHO cells from the CHO GS System&#x2122; (Lonza). In a particular embodiment, cells for expressing antibodies described herein are human cells, e.g., human cell lines. In a specific embodiment, a mammalian expression vector is pOptiVEC&#x2122; or pcDNA3.3. In a particular embodiment, bacterial cells such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>, or eukaryotic cells (e.g., mammalian cells), especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule, are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies (Foecking M K &#x26; Hofstetter H (1986) Gene 45: 101-5; and Cockett M I et al., (1990) Biotechnology 8(7): 662-7, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In certain embodiments, antibodies described herein are produced by CHO cells or NS0 cells. In a specific embodiment, the expression of nucleotide sequences encoding antibodies described herein which specifically bind PD-1 (e.g., human PD-1) is regulated by a constitutive promoter, inducible promoter or tissue specific promoter.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0276">In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors can be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such an antibody is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified can be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited to, the <i>E. coli </i>expression vector pUR278 (Ruether U &#x26; Mueller-Hill B (1983) EMBO J 2: 1791-1794), in which the antibody coding sequence can be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye S &#x26; Inouye M (1985) Nuc Acids Res 13: 3101-3109; Van Heeke G &#x26; Schuster S M (1989) J Biol Chem 24: 5503-5509); and the like, all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. For example, pGEX vectors can also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione 5-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0277">In an insect system, <i>Autographa californica </i>nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV), for example, can be used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in <i>Spodoptera frugiperda </i>cells. The antibody coding sequence can be cloned individually into non-essential regions (for example the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example the polyhedrin promoter).</p><p id="p-0289" num="0278">In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems can be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest can be ligated to an adenovirus transcription/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene can then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts (e.g., see Logan J &#x26; Shenk T (1984) PNAS 81(12): 3655-9, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Specific initiation signals can also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression can be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see, e.g., Bitter G et al., (1987) Methods Enzymol. 153: 516-544, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).</p><p id="p-0290" num="0279">In addition, a host cell strain can be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products can be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product can be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERO, BHK, Hela, MDCK, HEK 293, NIH 3T3, W138, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT2O and T47D, NS0 (a murine myeloma cell line that does not endogenously produce any immunoglobulin chains), CRL7O3O, COS (e.g., COS1 or COS), PER.C6, VERO, HsS78Bst, HEK-293T, HepG2, SP210, R1.1, B-W, L-M, BSC1, BSC40, YB/20, BMT10 and HsS78Bst cells. In certain embodiments, anti-PD-1 antibodies described herein are produced in mammalian cells, such as CHO cells.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0280">In a specific embodiment, the antibodies described herein have reduced fucose content or no fucose content. Such antibodies can be produced using techniques known one skilled in the art. For example, the antibodies can be expressed in cells deficient or lacking the ability of to fucosylate. In a specific example, cell lines with a knockout of both alleles of &#x3b1;1,6-fucosyltransferase can be used to produce antibodies with reduced fucose content. The Potelligent&#xae; system (Lonza) is an example of such a system that can be used to produce antibodies with reduced fucose content.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0281">For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression cells can be generated. For example, cell lines which stably express an anti-PD-1 antibody described herein can be engineered. In specific embodiments, a cell provided herein stably expresses a light chain/light chain variable region and a heavy chain/heavy chain variable region which associate to form an antibody described herein.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0282">In certain aspects, rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA/polynucleotide, engineered cells can be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method can advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express an anti-PD-1 antibody described herein or a fragment thereof. Such engineered cell lines can be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compositions that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0283">A number of selection systems can be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler M et al., (1977) Cell 11(1): 223-32), hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska E H &#x26; Szybalski W (1962) PNAS 48(12): 2026-2034) and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy I et al., (1980) Cell 22(3): 817-23) genes in tk-, hgprt- or aprt-cells, respectively, all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler M et al., (1980) PNAS 77(6): 3567-70; O'Hare K et al., (1981) PNAS 78: 1527-31); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan R C &#x26; Berg P (1981) PNAS 78(4): 2072-6); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (Wu G Y &#x26; Wu C H (1991) Biotherapy 3: 87-95; Tolstoshev P (1993) Ann Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 32: 573-596; Mulligan R C (1993) Science 260: 926-932; and Morgan R A &#x26; Anderson W F (1993) Ann Rev Biochem 62: 191-217; Nabel G J &#x26; Felgner P L (1993) Trends Biotechnol 11(5): 211-5); and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre R F et al., (1984) Gene 30(1-3): 147-56), all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.

When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse G F et al., (1983) Mol Cell Biol 3: 257-66, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).</p><p id="p-0296" num="0285">The host cell can be co-transfected with two or more expression vectors described herein, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors can contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. The host cells can be co-transfected with different amounts of the two or more expression vectors. For example, host cells can be transfected with any one of the following ratios of a first expression vector and a second expression vector: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9, 1:10, 1:12, 1:15, 1:20, 1:25, 1:30, 1:35, 1:40, 1:45, or 1:50.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0286">Alternatively, a single vector can be used which encodes, and is capable of expressing, both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot N J (1986) Nature 322: 562-565; and K&#xf6;hler G (1980) PNAS 77: 2197-2199, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains can comprise cDNA or genomic DNA. The expression vector can be monocistronic or multicistronic. A multicistronic nucleic acid construct can encode 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more, or in the range of 2-5, 5-10 or 10-20 genes/nucleotide sequences. For example, a bicistronic nucleic acid construct can comprise in the following order a promoter, a first gene (e.g., heavy chain of an antibody described herein), and a second gene and (e.g., light chain of an antibody described herein). In such an expression vector, the transcription of both genes can be driven by the promoter, whereas the translation of the mRNA from the first gene can be by a cap-dependent scanning mechanism and the translation of the mRNA from the second gene can be by a cap-independent mechanism, e.g., by an IRES.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0287">Once an antibody molecule described herein has been produced by recombinant expression, it can be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins.

The language &#x201c;substantially free of cellular material&#x201d; includes preparations of an antibody in which the antibody is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. Thus, an antibody that is substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of antibody having less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1% (by dry weight) of heterologous protein (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;contaminating protein&#x201d;) and/or variants of an antibody, for example, different post-translational modified forms of an antibody or other different versions of an antibody (e.g., antibody fragments). When the antibody is recombinantly produced, it is also generally substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, 10%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1% of the volume of the protein preparation. When the antibody is produced by chemical synthesis, it is generally substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals, i.e., it is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals which are involved in the synthesis of the protein. Accordingly, such preparations of the antibody have less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, or 5% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or compounds other than the antibody of interest.

The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced recombinantly from host cells exogenously expressing an antibody described herein or a fragment thereof, for example, light chain and/or heavy chain of such antibody.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0294">In specific embodiments, a &#x201c;monoclonal antibody,&#x201d; as used herein, is an antibody produced by a single cell (e.g., hybridoma or host cell producing a recombinant antibody), wherein the antibody specifically binds to PD-1 (e.g., human PD-1) as determined, e.g., by ELISA or other antigen-binding or competitive binding assay known in the art or in the examples provided herein. In particular embodiments, a monoclonal antibody can be a chimeric antibody or a humanized antibody. In certain embodiments, a monoclonal antibody is a monovalent antibody or multivalent (e.g., bivalent) antibody. In particular embodiments, a monoclonal antibody is a monospecific or multispecific antibody (e.g., bispecific antibody). Monoclonal antibodies described herein can, for example, be made by the hybridoma method as described in Kohler G &#x26; Milstein C (1975) Nature 256: 495, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, or can, e.g., be isolated from phage libraries using the techniques as described herein, for example.

For example, in the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a sheep, goat, rabbit, rat, hamster or macaque monkey, is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein (e.g., PD-1 (e.g., human PD-1)) used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding J W (Ed), Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Additionally, a RIMMS (repetitive immunization multiple sites) technique can be used to immunize an animal (Kilpatrick K E et al., (1997) Hybridoma 16:381-9, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).</p><p id="p-0307" num="0296">In some embodiments, mice (or other animals, such as rats, monkeys, donkeys, pigs, sheep, hamster, or dogs) can be immunized with an antigen (e.g., PD-1 (e.g., human PD-1)) and once an immune response is detected, e.g., antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well-known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells, for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC&#xae;) (Manassas, Va.), to form hybridomas. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. In certain embodiments, lymph nodes of the immunized mice are harvested and fused with NS0 myeloma cells.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0297">The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0298">Specific embodiments employ myeloma cells that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as NS0 cell line or those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif., USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8.653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md., USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor D (1984) J Immunol 133: 3001-5; Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987), each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).</p><p id="p-0310" num="0299">Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against PD-1 (e.g., human PD-1).

A Fab fragment corresponds to one of the two identical arms of an antibody molecule and contains the complete light chain paired with the VH and CH1 domains of the heavy chain. A F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment contains the two antigen-binding arms of an antibody molecule linked by disulfide bonds in the hinge region.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0303">Further, the antibodies described herein can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In particular, DNA sequences encoding VH and VL domains are amplified from animal cDNA libraries (e.g., human or murine cDNA libraries of affected tissues). The DNA encoding the VH and VL domains are recombined together with a scFv linker by PCR and cloned into a phagemid vector. The vector is electroporated in <i>E. coli </i>and the <i>E. coli </i>is infected with helper phage. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13, and the VH and VL domains are usually recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII. Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds to a particular antigen can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead.

In particular embodiments, an antibody described herein, which competitively blocks (e.g., in a dose-dependent manner) any one of the antibodies described herein, from binding to PD-1 (e.g., human PD-1), is a human antibody. Human antibodies can be produced using any method known in the art. For example, transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes, can be used. In particular, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes can be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region can be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes can be rendered non-functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the J<sub>H </sub>region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of an antigen (e.g., PD-1). Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies.
