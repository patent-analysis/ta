The present invention also relates to the treatment of immune disorders and diseases such as cancer.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since the molecular identification of the first human tumor antigens in the early 1990's, several clinical trials were completed to evaluate the effects of therapeutic vaccination of cancer patients with shared tumor-specific antigens (Boon, T. et al. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006, 24:175-208). Evidence of tumor regression was observed in about 20% of the patients, with objective clinical responses in 5-10%. Therefore, vaccination with tumor-specific antigens represents a new promising therapy for treating cancer.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Strategies are needed to improve the proportion of patients that respond to vaccination. The main limiting factor to clinical efficacy of current therapeutic cancer vaccines does not appear to be the vaccine itself, but local factors controlling the tumor microenvironment in which the anti-tumor T cells have to work.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Regulatory T cells, or Tregs, are a subset of CD4+ T lymphocytes specialized in the inhibition of immune responses. Insufficient Treg function results in autoimmune pathology, while excessive Treg function may inhibit anti-tumor immune responses in cancer patients. The exact mechanisms by which Tregs inhibit immune responses are not fully understood.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Due to their immunosuppressive functions, Tregs represent potential inhibitors of spontaneous or vaccine-induced anti-tumor immune responses. In murine models, the depletion of Tregs can improve immune responses against experimental tumors (Colombo et al. Nat. Rev. Cancer 2007, 7:880-887). Thus, targeting Tregs in humans could improve the efficacy of immunotherapy against cancer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It has been demonstrated that active TGF-&#x3b2; is produced by human Tregs, but not other types of human T lymphocytes (Stockis, J. et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 2009, 39:869-882), TGF-&#x3b2; could be a target of interest.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, antibodies against hTGF-&#x3b2; were not found promising. Phase 1 clinical trials have been conducted in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and advanced malignant melanoma or renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Lonning S et al. Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology 2011, 12:2176-2189). Depending on the trial, adverse events were observed in some patients. The main adverse reactions reported consisted in the development of keratoacanthoma (KA) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in melanoma patients. It is possible that the KA or SCC lesions in melanoma patients evolved from pre-cancerous cells whose proliferation was being inhibited by endogenous TGF-&#x3b2; (Lonning S et al. Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology 2011, 12:2176-2189). Therefore, a major concern regarding the use of anti-TGF-&#x3b2; antibodies in the context of cancer is that they may favor the appearance of new neoplastic lesions, due to the inhibition of the tumor-suppressive effect exerted by endogenous TGF-&#x3b2; on pre-cancerous cells.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One object of the invention is to provide a new strategy for improving cancer treatment by targeting Tregs via their production of TGF-&#x3b2;.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It was previously shown that the production of TGF-&#x3b2; is tightly regulated by a multi-step process. The precursor pro-TGF-&#x3b2;1 homodimerizes prior to cleavage by pro-protein convertase FURIN. The resulting product is called latent TGF-&#x3b2;1, in which the C-terminal fragment, or mature TGF-&#x3b2;1, remains non-covalently bound to the N-terminal fragment known as the Latency Associated Peptide, or LAP. This latent complex is inactive because LAP prevents mature TGF-&#x3b2;1 from binding to its receptor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the present application, the inventors show that latent TGF-&#x3b2; is shown to bind to the surface of Tregs through the transmembrane protein GARP (glycoprotein A repetitions predominant).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention therefore provides a new strategy for targeting Treg based on an anti-GARP protein inhibiting TGF-&#x3b2; signaling.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">One object of the invention is a protein binding to Glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP) in the presence of TGF-&#x3b2;.

The term &#x201c;GARP antibodies&#x201d; is used herein to refer to antibodies which exhibit immunological specificity for human GARP protein. As explained elsewhere herein, &#x201c;specificity&#x201d; for human GARP does not exclude cross-reaction with species homologues of GARP. In addition, it also does not exclude antibodies recognising an epitope spanning GARP protein residues and TGF-&#x3b2; protein residue. Antibodies and immunoglobulins comprise light and heavy chains, with or without an interchain covalent linkage between them. Basic immunoglobulin structures in vertebrate systems are relatively well understood. The generic term &#x201c;immunoglobulin&#x201d; comprises five distinct classes of antibody that can be distinguished biochemically. All five classes of antibodies are within the scope of the present invention, the following discussion will generally be directed to the IgG class of immunoglobulin molecules. With regard to IgG, immunoglobulins comprise two identical light polypeptide chains of molecular weight approximately 23,000 Daltons, and two identical heavy chains of molecular weight 53,000-70,000 Daltons. The four chains are joined by disulfide bonds in a &#x201c;Y&#x201d; configuration wherein the light chains bracket the heavy chains starting at the mouth of the &#x201c;Y&#x201d; and continuing through the variable region. The light chains of an antibody are classified as either kappa or lambda ([&#x3ba;], [&#x3bb;]). Each heavy chain class may be bonded with either a kappa or lambda light chain. In general, the light and heavy chains are covalently bonded to each other, and the &#x201c;tail&#x201d; regions of the two heavy chains are bonded to each other by covalent disulfide linkages or non-covalent linkages when the immunoglobulins are generated either by hybridomas, B cells or genetically engineered host cells. In the heavy chain, the amino acid sequences run from an N-terminus at the forked ends of the Y configuration to the C-terminus at the bottom of each chain. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon (&#x3b3;, &#x3bc;, &#x3b1;, &#x3b4;, &#x3b5;) with some subclasses among them (e.g., &#x3b3;1-&#x3b3;4). It is the nature of this chain that determines the &#x201c;class&#x201d; of the antibody as IgG, IgM, IgA IgG, or IgE, respectively. The immunoglobulin subclasses (isotypes) e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, etc. are well characterized and are known to confer functional specialization. Modified versions of each of these classes and isotypes are readily discernable to the skilled artisan in view of the instant disclosure and, accordingly, are within the scope of the instant invention. As indicated above, the variable region of an antibody allows the antibody to selectively recognize and specifically bind epitopes on antigens. That is, the VL domain and VH domain of an antibody combine to form the variable region that defines a three dimensional antigen binding site. This quaternary antibody structure forms the antigen binding site present at the end of each arm of the Y. More specifically, the antigen binding site is defined by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) on each of the VH and VL chains.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0094">&#x201c;An isolated antibody&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, an &#x201c;isolated antibody&#x201d; is one that has been separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses of the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non proteinaceous components. In preferred embodiments, the antibody is purified: (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight; (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator; or (3) to homogeneity as shown by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions and using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver staining. An isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, an isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0095">&#x201c;Affinity variants&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the term &#x201c;affinity variant&#x201d; refers to a variant antibody which exhibits one or more changes in amino acid sequence compared to a reference GARP antibody, wherein the affinity variant exhibits an altered affinity for the human GARP protein or GARP/TGF-&#x3b2; complex in comparison to the reference antibody. Typically, affinity variants will exhibit an improved affinity for human GARP or human GARP/TGF-&#x3b2; complex, as compared to the reference GARP antibody. The improvement may be a lower KD for human GARP, a faster off-rate for human GARP, or an alteration in the pattern of cross-reactivity with non-human GARP homologues. Affinity variants typically exhibit one or more changes in amino acid sequence in the CDRs, as compared to the reference GARP antibody. Such substitutions may result in replacement of the original amino acid present at a given position in the CDRs with a different amino acid residue, which may be a naturally occurring amino acid residue or a non-naturally occurring amino acid residue. The amino acid substitutions may be conservative or non-conservative.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0096">&#x201c;Binding Site&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the term &#x201c;binding site&#x201d; comprises a region of a polypeptide which is responsible for selectively binding to a target antigen of interest (e.g. human GARP). Binding domains or binding regions comprise at least one binding site. Exemplary binding domains include an antibody variable domain. The antibody molecules of the invention may comprise a single antigen binding site or multiple (e.g., two, three or four) antigen binding sites.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0097">&#x201c;Conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, a &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art, including basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a nonessential amino acid residue in an immunoglobulin polypeptide may be replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. In another embodiment, a string of amino acids can be replaced with a structurally similar string that differs in order and/or composition of side chain family members.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0098">&#x201c;Chimeric&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, a &#x201c;chimeric&#x201d; protein comprises a first amino acid sequence linked to a second amino acid sequence with which it is not naturally linked in nature. The amino acid sequences may normally exist in separate proteins that are brought together in the fusion polypeptide or they may normally exist in the same protein but are placed in a new arrangement in the fusion polypeptide. A chimeric protein may be created, for example, by chemical synthesis, or by creating and translating a polynucleotide in which the peptide regions are encoded in the desired relationship. Exemplary chimeric GARP antibodies include fusion proteins comprising camelid-derived VH and VL domains, or humanised variants thereof, fused to the constant domains of a human antibody, e.g. human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0099">&#x201c;CDR&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the term &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; or &#x201c;complementarity determining region&#x201d; means the non-contiguous antigen combining sites found within the variable region of both heavy and light chain polypeptides. These particular regions have been described by Kabat et al., J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6609-6616 (1977) and Kabat et al., Sequences of protein of immunological interest. (1991), by Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987), and by MacCallum et al., J. Mol. Biol. 262:732-745 (1996) where the definitions include overlapping or subsets of amino acid residues when compared against each other. The amino acid residues which encompass the CDRs as defined by each of the above cited references are set forth for comparison. Preferably, the term &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; is a CDR as defined by Kabat based on sequence comparisons.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0100"><tables id="TABLE-US-00007" num="00007"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>CDR definitions</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="168pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>CDR definitions</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Kabat (1)</entry><entry>Chothia (2)</entry><entry>MacCallum (3)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>VH CDR1</entry><entry>31-35</entry><entry>26-32</entry><entry>30-35</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>VH CDR2</entry><entry>50-65</entry><entry>53-55</entry><entry>47-58</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>VH CDR3</entry><entry>&#x2002;95-102</entry><entry>&#x2002;96-101</entry><entry>&#x2002;93-101</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>VL CDR1</entry><entry>24-34</entry><entry>26-32</entry><entry>30-36</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>VL CDR2</entry><entry>50-56</entry><entry>50-52</entry><entry>46-55</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>VL CDR3</entry><entry>89-97</entry><entry>91-96</entry><entry>89-96</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00001">(1) Residue numbering follows the nomenclature of Kabat et al., supra</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00002">(2) Residue numbering follows the nomenclature of Chothia et al., supra</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00003">(3) Residue numbering follows the nomenclature of MacCallum et al., supra</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0084" num="0101">&#x201c;CH2 domain&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein the term &#x201c;CH2 domain&#x201d; includes the region of a heavy chain molecule that extends, e.g., from about residue 244 to residue 360 of an antibody using conventional numbering schemes (residues 244 to 360, Kabat numbering system; and residues 231-340, EU numbering system, Kabat E A et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. Bethesda, US Department of Health and Human Services, NIH. 1991). The CH2 domain is unique in that it is not closely paired with another domain. Rather, two N-linked branched carbohydrate chains are interposed between the two CH2 domains of an intact native IgG molecule. It is also well documented that the CH3 domain extends from the CH2 domain to the C-terminal of the IgG molecule and comprises approximately 108 residues.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0102">&#x201c;Camelid-Derived&#x201d;&#x2014;In certain preferred embodiments, the GARP antibody molecules of the invention comprise framework amino acid sequences and/or CDR amino acid sequences derived from a camelid conventional antibody raised by active immunization of a camelid with GARP antigen. However, GARP antibodies comprising camelid-derived amino acid sequences may be engineered to comprise framework and/or constant region sequences derived from a human amino acid sequence or other non-camelid mammalian species. For example, a human or non-human primate framework region, heavy chain region, and/or hinge region may be included in the subject GARP antibodies. In an embodiment, one or more non-camelid amino acids may be present in the framework region of a &#x201c;camelid-derived&#x201d; GARP antibody, e.g., a camelid framework amino acid sequence may comprise one or more amino acid mutations in which the corresponding human or non-human primate amino acid residue is present. Moreover, camelid-derived VH and VL domains, or humanized variants thereof, may be linked to the constant domains of human antibodies to produce a chimeric molecule, as extensively described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0103">&#x201c;Derived From&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein the term &#x201c;derived from&#x201d; a designated protein (e.g. a GARP antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof) refers to the origin of the polypeptide. In an embodiment, the polypeptide or amino acid sequence which is derived from a particular starting polypeptide is a CDR sequence or sequence related thereto. In an embodiment, the amino acid sequence which is derived from a particular starting polypeptide is not contiguous. For example, in an embodiment, one, two, three, four, five, or six CDRs are derived from a starting antibody. In an embodiment, the polypeptide or amino acid sequence which is derived from a particular starting polypeptide or amino acid sequence has an amino acid sequence that is essentially identical to that of the starting sequence, or a region thereof wherein the region consists of at least of at least 3-5 amino acids, 5-10 amino acids, at least 10-20 amino acids, at least 20-30 amino acids, or at least 30-50 amino acids, or which is otherwise identifiable to one of ordinary skill in the art as having its origin in the starting sequence. In an embodiment, the one or more CDR sequences derived from the starting antibody are altered to produce variant CDR sequences, e.g. affinity variants, wherein the variant CDR sequences maintain GARP binding activity.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0104">&#x201c;Diabodies&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the term &#x201c;diabodies&#x201d; refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing sFv fragments (see sFv paragraph) with short linkers (about 5-10 residues) between the VH and VL domains such that inter-chain but not intra-chain pairing of the V domains is achieved, resulting in a bivalent fragment, i.e., fragment having two antigen-binding sites. Bispecific diabodies are heterodimers of two &#x201c;crossover&#x201d; sFv fragments in which the VH and VL domains of the two antibodies are present on different polypeptide chains. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Holliger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 90:6444-6448 (1993).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0105">&#x201c;Engineered&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein the term &#x201c;engineered&#x201d; includes manipulation of nucleic acid or polypeptide molecules by synthetic means (e.g. by recombinant techniques, in vitro peptide synthesis, by enzymatic or chemical coupling of peptides or some combination of these techniques). Preferably, the antibodies of the invention are engineered, including for example, humanized and/or chimeric antibodies, and antibodies which have been engineered to improve one or more properties, such as antigen binding, stability/half-life or effector function.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0106">&#x201c;Epitope&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; refers to a specific arrangement of amino acids located on a peptide or protein or proteins to which an antibody binds. Epitopes often consist of a chemically active surface grouping of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains, and have specific three dimensional structural characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics. Epitopes can be linear or conformational, i.e., involving two or more sequences of amino acids in various regions of the antigen that may not necessarily be contiguous.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0107">&#x201c;Framework region&#x201d;&#x2014;The term &#x201c;framework region&#x201d; or &#x201c;FR region&#x201d; as used herein, includes the amino acid residues that are part of the variable region, but are not part of the CDRs (e.g., using the Kabat definition of CDRs). Therefore, a variable region framework is between about 100-120 amino acids in length but includes only those amino acids outside of the CDRs. For the specific example of a heavy chain variable region and for the CDRs as defined by Kabat et al., framework region 1 corresponds to the domain of the variable region encompassing amino acids 1-30; framework region 2 corresponds to the domain of the variable region encompassing amino acids 36-49; framework region 3 corresponds to the domain of the variable region encompassing amino acids 66-94, and framework region 4 corresponds to the domain of the variable region from amino acids 103 to the end of the variable region. The framework regions for the light chain are similarly separated by each of the light claim variable region CDRs. Similarly, using the definition of CDRs by Chothia et al. or McCallum et al. the framework region boundaries are separated by the respective CDR termini as described above. In preferred embodiments the CDRs are as defined by Kabat. In naturally occurring antibodies, the six CDRs present on each monomeric antibody are short, non-contiguous sequences of amino acids that are specifically positioned to form the antigen binding site as the antibody assumes its three dimensional configuration in an aqueous environment. The remainder of the heavy and light variable domains show less inter-molecular variability in amino acid sequence and are termed the framework regions. The framework regions largely adopt a [beta]-sheet conformation and the CDRs form loops which connect, and in some cases form part of, the [beta]-sheet structure. Thus, these framework regions act to form a scaffold that provides for positioning the six CDRs in correct orientation by inter-chain, non-covalent interactions. The antigen binding site formed by the positioned CDRs defines a surface complementary to the epitope on the immunoreactive antigen. This complementary surface promotes the non-covalent binding of the antibody to the immunoreactive antigen epitope. The position of CDRs can be readily identified by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0108">&#x201c;Fragment&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the term &#x201c;fragment&#x201d; refers to a part or region of an antibody or antibody chain comprising fewer amino acid residues than an intact or complete antibody or antibody chain. The term &#x201c;antigen-binding fragment&#x201d; refers to a polypeptide fragment of an immunoglobulin or antibody that binds antigen or competes with intact antibody (i.e., with the intact antibody from which they were derived) for antigen binding (i.e., specific binding to human GARP). As used herein, the term &#x201c;fragment&#x201d; of an antibody molecule includes antigen-binding fragments of antibodies, for example, an antibody light chain variable domain (VL), an antibody heavy chain variable domain (VH), a single chain antibody (scFv), a F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragment, a Fab fragment, an Fd fragment, an Fv fragment, a single domain antibody fragment (DAb), a one-armed (monovalent) antibody, diabodies or any antigen-binding molecule formed by combination, assembly or conjugation of such antigen binding fragments. Fragments can be obtained, e.g., via chemical or enzymatic treatment of an intact or complete antibody or antibody chain or by recombinant means.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0109">&#x201c;Fv&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the term &#x201c;Fv&#x201d; is the minimum antibody fragment that contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (three loops each from the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0110">&#x201c;Heavy chain region&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the term &#x201c;heavy chain region&#x201d; includes amino acid sequences derived from the constant domains of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. A polypeptide comprising a heavy chain region comprises at least one of: a CH1 domain, a hinge (e.g., upper, middle, and/or lower hinge region) domain, a CH2 domain, a CH3 domain, or a variant or fragment thereof. In an embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention may comprise the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain (e.g., a hinge portion, a CH2 domain, and a CH3 domain). In another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention lacks at least a region of a constant domain (e.g., all or part of a CH2 domain). In certain embodiments, at least one, and preferably all, of the constant domains are derived from a human immunoglobulin heavy chain. For example, in one preferred embodiment, the heavy chain region comprises a fully human hinge domain. In other preferred embodiments, the heavy chain region comprising a fully human Fc region (e.g., hinge, CH2 and CH3 domain sequences from a human immunoglobulin). In certain embodiments, the constituent constant domains of the heavy chain region are from different immunoglobulin molecules. For example, a heavy chain region of a polypeptide may comprise a CH2 domain derived from an IgG1 molecule and a hinge region derived from an IgG3 or IgG4 molecule. In other embodiments, the constant domains are chimeric domains comprising regions of different immunoglobulin molecules. For example, a hinge may comprise a first region from an IgG1 molecule and a second region from an IgG3 or IgG4 molecule. As set forth above, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the constant domains of the heavy chain region may be modified such that they vary in amino acid sequence from the naturally occurring (wild-type) immunoglobulin molecule. That is, the polypeptides of the invention disclosed herein may comprise alterations or modifications to one or more of the heavy chain constant domains (CH1, hinge, CH2 or CH3) and/or to the light chain constant domain (CL). Exemplary modifications include additions, deletions or substitutions of one or more amino acids in one or more domains.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0111">&#x201c;Hinge region&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the term &#x201c;hinge region&#x201d; includes the region of a heavy chain molecule that joins the CH1 domain to the CH2 domain. This hinge region comprises approximately 25 residues and is flexible, thus allowing the two N-terminal antigen binding regions to move independently. Hinge regions can be subdivided into three distinct domains: upper, middle, and lower hinge domains (Roux et al. J. Immunol. 1998 161:4083).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0112">The terms &#x201c;hypervariable loop&#x201d; and &#x201c;complementarity determining region&#x201d; are not strictly synonymous, since the hypervariable loops (HVs) are defined on the basis of structure, whereas complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are defined based on sequence variability (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1983) and the limits of the HVs and the CDRs may be different in some VH and VL domains. The CDRs of the VL and VH domains can typically be defined as comprising the following amino acids: residues 24-34 (CDRL1), 50-56 (CDRL2) and 89-97 (CDRL3) in the light chain variable domain, and residues 31-35 or 31-35b (CDRH1), 50-65 (CDRH2) and 95-102 (CDRH3) in the heavy chain variable domain; (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). Thus, the HVs may be comprised within the corresponding CDRs and references herein to the &#x201c;hypervariable loops&#x201d; of VH and VL domains should be interpreted as also encompassing the corresponding CDRs, and vice versa, unless otherwise indicated. The more highly conserved regions of variable domains are called the framework region (FR), as defined below. The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs (FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4, respectively), largely adopting a [beta]-sheet configuration, connected by the three hypervariable loops. The hypervariable loops in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the hypervariable loops from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies. Structural analysis of antibodies revealed the relationship between the sequence and the shape of the binding site formed by the complementarity determining regions (Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 227: 799-817 (1992)); Tramontano et al., J. Mol. Biol, 215: 175-182 (1990)). Despite their high sequence variability, five of the six loops adopt just a small repertoire of main-chain conformations, called &#x201c;canonical structures&#x201d;. These conformations are first of all determined by the length of the loops and secondly by the presence of key residues at certain positions in the loops and in the framework regions that determine the conformation through their packing, hydrogen bonding or the ability to assume unusual main-chain conformations.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0113">&#x201c;Humanising substitutions&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the term &#x201c;humanising substitutions&#x201d; refers to amino acid substitutions in which the amino acid residue present at a particular position in the VH or VL domain antibody GARP antibody (for example a camelid-derived GARP antibody) is replaced with an amino acid residue which occurs at an equivalent position in a reference human VH or VL domain. The reference human VH or VL domain may be a VH or VL domain encoded by the human germline, in which case the substituted residues may be referred to as &#x201c;germlining substitutions&#x201d;. Humanising/germlining substitutions may be made in the framework regions and/or the CDRs of a GARP antibody, defined herein.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0114">&#x201c;High human homology&#x201d;&#x2014;An antibody comprising a heavy chain variable domain (VH) and a light chain variable domain (VL) will be considered as having high human homology if the VH domains and the VL domains, taken together, exhibit at least 90% amino acid sequence identity to the closest matching human germline VH and VL sequences. Antibodies having high human homology may include antibodies comprising VH and VL domains of native non-human antibodies which exhibit sufficiently high % sequence identity human germline sequences, including for example antibodies comprising VH and VL domains of camelid conventional antibodies, as well as engineered, especially humanized, variants of such antibodies and also &#x201c;fully human&#x201d; antibodies. In an embodiment the VH domain of the antibody with high human homology may exhibit an amino acid sequence identity or sequence homology of 80% or greater with one or more human VH domains across the framework regions FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4. In other embodiments the amino acid sequence identity or sequence homology between the VH domain of the polypeptide of the invention and the closest matching human germline VH domain sequence may be 85% or greater, 90% or greater, 95% or greater, 97% or greater, or up to 99% or even 100%. In an embodiment the VH domain of the antibody with high human homology may contain one or more (e.g. 1 to 10) amino acid sequence mis-matches across the framework regions FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4, in comparison to the closest matched human VH sequence. In another embodiment the VL domain of the antibody with high human homology may exhibit a sequence identity or sequence homology of 80% or greater with one or more human VL domains across the framework regions FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4. In other embodiments the amino acid sequence identity or sequence homology between the VL domain of the polypeptide of the invention and the closest matching human germline VL domain sequence may be 85% or greater 90% or greater, 95% or greater, 97% or greater, or up to 99% or even 100%.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0115">In an embodiment the VL domain of the antibody with high human homology may contain one or more (e.g. 1 to 10) amino acid sequence mis-matches across the framework regions FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4, in comparison to the closest matched human VL sequence. Before analyzing the percentage sequence identity between the antibody with high human homology and human germline VH and VL, the canonical folds may be determined, which allow the identification of the family of human germline segments with the identical combination of canonical folds for H1 and H2 or L1 and L2 (and L3). Subsequently the human germline family member that has the highest degree of sequence homology with the variable region of the antibody of interest is chosen for scoring the sequence homology. The determination of Chothia canonical classes of hypervariable loops L1, L2, L3, H1 and H2 can be performed with the bioinformatics tools publicly available on webpage www.bioinf.org.uk/abs/chothia.html.page. The output of the program shows the key residue requirements in a data file. In these data files, the key residue positions are shown with the allowed amino acids at each position. The sequence of the variable region of the antibody of interest is given as input and is first aligned with a consensus antibody sequence to assign the Kabat numbering scheme. The analysis of the canonical folds uses a set of key residue templates derived by an automated method developed by Martin and Thornton (Martin et al., J. Mol. Biol. 263:800-815 (1996)). With the particular human germline V segment known, which uses the same combination of canonical folds for H1 and H2 or L1 and L2 (and L3), the best matching family member in terms of sequence homology can be determined. With bioinformatics tools the percentage sequence identity between the VH and VL domain framework amino acid sequences of the antibody of interest and corresponding sequences encoded by the human germline can be determined, but actually manual alignment of the sequences can be applied as well. Human immunoglobulin sequences can be identified from several protein data bases, such as VBase (http://vbase.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk/) or the Pluckthun/Honegger database (http://www.bioc.unizh.ch/antibody/Sequences/Germlines). To compare the human sequences to the V regions of VH or VL domains in an antibody of interest a sequence alignment algorithm such as available via websites like www.expasy.ch/tools/#align can be used, but also manual alignment with the limited set of sequences can be performed. Human germline light and heavy chain sequences of the families with the same combinations of canonical folds and with the highest degree of homology with the framework regions 1, 2, and 3 of each chain are selected and compared with the variable region of interest; also the FR4 is checked against the human germline JH and JK or JL regions. Note that in the calculation of overall percent sequence homology the residues of FR1, FR2 and FR3 are evaluated using the closest match sequence from the human germline family with the identical combination of canonical folds. Only residues different from the closest match or other members of the same family with the same combination of canonical folds are scored (NB&#x2014;excluding any primer-encoded differences). However, for the purposes of humanization, residues in framework regions identical to members of other human germline families, which do not have the same combination of canonical folds, can be considered &#x201c;human&#x201d;, despite the fact that these are scored &#x201c;negative&#x201d; according to the stringent conditions described above. This assumption is based on the &#x201c;mix and match&#x201d; approach for humanization, in which each of FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4 is separately compared to its closest matching human germline sequence and the humanized molecule therefore contains a combination of different FRs as was done by Qu and colleagues (Qu et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 5:3095-3100 (1999)) and Ono and colleagues (Ono et al., Mol. Immunol. 36:387-395 (1999)). The boundaries of the individual framework regions may be assigned using the IMGT numbering scheme, which is an adaptation of the numbering scheme of Chothia (Lefranc et al., NAR 27: 209-212 (1999); http://im.gt.cines.fr). Antibodies with high human homology may comprise hypervariable loops or CDRs having human or human-like canonical folds, as discussed in detail below. In an embodiment at least one hypervariable loop or CDR in either the VH domain or the VL domain of the antibody with high human homology may be obtained or derived from a VH or VL domain of a non-human antibody, for example a conventional antibody from a species of Camelidae, yet exhibit a predicted or actual canonical fold structure which is substantially identical to a canonical fold structure which occurs in human antibodies. It is well established in the art that although the primary amino acid sequences of hypervariable loops present in both VH domains and VL domains encoded by the human germline are, by definition, highly variable, all hypervariable loops, except CDR H3 of the VH domain, adopt only a few distinct structural conformations, termed canonical folds (Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987); Tramontano et al. Proteins 6:382-94 (1989)), which depend on both the length of the hypervariable loop and presence of the so-called canonical amino acid residues (Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). Actual canonical structures of the hypervariable loops in intact VH or VL domains can be determined by structural analysis (e.g. X-ray crystallography), but it is also possible to predict canonical structure on the basis of key amino acid residues which are characteristic of a particular structure (discussed further below). In essence, the specific pattern of residues that determines each canonical structure forms a &#x201c;signature&#x201d; which enables the canonical structure to be recognised in hypervariable loops of a VH or VL domain of unknown structure; canonical structures can therefore be predicted on the basis of primary amino acid sequence alone. The predicted canonical fold structures for the hypervariable loops of any given VH or VL sequence in an antibody with high human homology can be analysed using algorithms which are publicly available from www.bioinf.org.uk/abs/chothia.html, www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/&#x2dc;martin/antibodies.html and www.bioc.unizh.ch/antibody/Sequences/Germlines/Vbase_hVk.html. These tools permit query VH or VL sequences to be aligned against human VH or VL domain sequences of known canonical structure, and a prediction of canonical structure made for the hypervariable loops of the query sequence. In the case of the VH domain, H1 and H2 loops may be scored as having a canonical fold structure &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; to a canonical fold structure known to occur in human antibodies if at least the first, and preferable both, of the following criteria are fulfilled:</p><p id="p-0099" num="0116">1. An identical length, determined by the number of residues, to the closest matching human canonical structural class.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0117">2. At least 33% identity, preferably at least 50% identity with the key amino acid residues described for the corresponding human H1 and H2 canonical structural classes (note for the purposes of the foregoing analysis the H1 and H2 loops are treated separately and each compared against its closest matching human canonical structural class). The foregoing analysis relies on prediction of the canonical structure of the H1 and H2 loops of the antibody of interest. If the actual structures of the H1 and H2 loops in the antibody of interest are known, for example based on X-ray crystallography, then the H1 and H2 loops in the antibody of interest may also be scored as having a canonical fold structure &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; to a canonical fold structure known to occur in human antibodies if the length of the loop differs from that of the closest matching human canonical structural class (typically by +1 or +2 amino acids) but the actual structure of the H1 and H2 loops in the antibody of interest matches the structure of a human canonical fold. Key amino acid residues found in the human canonical structural classes for the first and second hypervariable loops of human VH domains (H1 and H2) are described by Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 227:799-817 (1992), the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. In particular, Table 3 on page 802 of Chothia et al., which is specifically incorporated herein by reference, lists preferred amino acid residues at key sites for H1 canonical structures found in the human germline, whereas Table 4 on page 803, also specifically incorporated by reference, lists preferred amino acid residues at key sites for CDR H2 canonical structures found in the human germline. In an embodiment, both H1 and H2 in the VH domain of the antibody with high human homology exhibit a predicted or actual canonical fold structure which is substantially identical to a canonical fold structure which occurs in human antibodies. Antibodies with high human homology may comprise a VH domain in which the hypervariable loops H1 and H2 form a combination of canonical fold structures which is identical to a combination of canonical structures known to occur in at least one human germline VH domain. It has been observed that only certain combinations of canonical fold structures at H1 and H2 actually occur in VH domains encoded by the human germline. In an embodiment H1 and H2 in the VH domain of the antibody with high human homology may be obtained from a VH domain of a non-human species, e.g. a Camelidae species, yet form a combination of predicted or actual canonical fold structures which is identical to a combination of canonical fold structures known to occur in a human germline or somatically mutated VH domain. In non-limiting embodiments H1 and H2 in the VH domain of the antibody with high human homology may be obtained from a VH domain of a non-human species, e.g. a Camelidae species, and form one of the following canonical fold combinations: 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-6, 1-4, 2-1, 3-1 and 3-5. An antibody with high human homology may contain a VH domain which exhibits both high sequence identity/sequence homology with human VH, and which contains hypervariable loops exhibiting structural homology with human VH. It may be advantageous for the canonical folds present at H1 and H2 in the VH domain of the antibody with high human homology, and the combination thereof, to be &#x201c;correct&#x201d; for the human VH germline sequence which represents the closest match with the VH domain of the antibody with high human homology in terms of overall primary amino acid sequence identity. By way of example, if the closest sequence match is with a human germline VH3 domain, then it may be advantageous for H1 and H2 to form a combination of canonical folds which also occurs naturally in a human VH3 domain. This may be particularly important in the case of antibodies with high human homology which are derived from non-human species, e.g. antibodies containing VH and VL domains which are derived from camelid conventional antibodies, especially antibodies containing humanised camelid VH and VL domains. Thus, in an embodiment the VH domain of the GARP antibody with high human homology may exhibit a sequence identity or sequence homology of 80% or greater, 85% or greater, 90% or greater, 95% or greater, 97% or greater, or up to 99% or even 100% with a human VH domain across the framework regions FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4, and in addition H1 and H2 in the same antibody are obtained from a non-human VH domain (e.g. derived from a Camelidae species), but form a combination of predicted or actual canonical fold structures which is the same as a canonical fold combination known to occur naturally in the same human VH domain. In other embodiments, L1 and L2 in the VL domain of the antibody with high human homology are each obtained from a VL domain of a non-human species (e.g. a camelid-derived VL domain), and each exhibits a predicted or actual canonical fold structure which is substantially identical to a canonical fold structure which occurs in human antibodies. As with the VH domains, the hypervariable loops of VL domains of both VLambda and VKappa types can adopt a limited number of conformations or canonical structures, determined in part by length and also by the presence of key amino acid residues at certain canonical positions. Within an antibody of interest having high human homology, L1, L2 and L3 loops obtained from a VL domain of a non-human species, e.g. a Camelidae species, may be scored as having a canonical fold structure &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; to a canonical fold structure known to occur in human antibodies if at least the first, and preferable both, of the following criteria are fulfilled:</p><p id="p-0101" num="0118">1. An identical length, determined by the number of residues, to the closest matching human structural class.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0119">2. At least 33% identity, preferably at least 50% identity with the key amino acid residues described for the corresponding human L1 or L2 canonical structural classes, from either the VLambda or the VKappa repertoire (note for the purposes of the foregoing analysis the L1 and L2 loops are treated separately and each compared against its closest matching human canonical structural class). The foregoing analysis relies on prediction of the canonical structure of the L1, L2 and L3 loops in the VL domain of the antibody of interest. If the actual structure of the L1, L2 and L3 loops is known, for example based on X-ray crystallography, then L1, L2 or L3 loops derived from the antibody of interest may also be scored as having a canonical fold structure &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; to a canonical fold structure known to occur in human antibodies if the length of the loop differs from that of the closest matching human canonical structural class (typically by +1 or +2 amino acids) but the actual structure of the Camelidae loops matches a human canonical fold. Key amino acid residues found in the human canonical structural classes for the CDRs of human VLambda and VKappa domains are described by Morea et al. Methods, 20: 267-279 (2000) and Martin et al., J. Mol. Biol., 263:800-815 (1996). The structural repertoire of the human VKappa domain is also described by Tomlinson et al. EMBO J. 14:4628-4638 (1995), and that of the VLambda domain by Williams et al. J. Mol. Biol., 264:220-232 (1996). The contents of all these documents are to be incorporated herein by reference. L1 and L2 in the VL domain of an antibody with high human homology may form a combination of predicted or actual canonical fold structures which is identical to a combination of canonical fold structures known to occur in a human germline VL domain. In non-limiting embodiments L1 and L2 in the VLambda domain of an antibody with high human homology (e.g. an antibody containing a camelid-derived VL domain or a humanised variant thereof) may form one of the following canonical fold combinations: 11-7, 13-7(A,B,C), 14-7(A,B), 12-11, 14-11 and 12-12 (as defined in Williams et al. J. Mol. Biol. 264:220-32 (1996) and as shown on http://www.bioc.uzh.ch/antibody/Sequences/Germlines/VBase_hVL.html). In non-limiting embodiments L1 and L2 in the Vkappa domain may form one of the following canonical fold combinations: 2-1, 3-1, 4-1 and 6-1 (as defined in Tomlinson et al. EMBO J. 14:4628-38 (1995) and as shown on http://www.bioc.uzh.ch/antibody/Sequences/Germlines/VBase_hVK.html).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0120">In a further embodiment, all three of L1, L2 and L3 in the VL domain of an antibody with high human homology may exhibit a substantially human structure.

It is, of course, envisaged that VH domains exhibiting high sequence identity/sequence homology with human VH, and also structural homology with hypervariable loops of human VH will be combined with VL domains exhibiting high sequence identity/sequence homology with human VL, and also structural homology with hypervariable loops of human VL to provide antibodies with high human homology containing VH/VL pairings (e.g. camelid-derived VH/VL pairings) with maximal sequence and structural homology to human-encoded VH/VL pairings.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0122">&#x201c;Immunospecific&#x201d;, &#x201c;specific for&#x201d; or to &#x201c;specifically bind&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, an antibody is said to be &#x201c;immunospecific&#x201d;, &#x201c;specific for&#x201d; or to &#x201c;specifically bind&#x201d; an antigen if it reacts at a detectable level with the antigen, preferably with an affinity constant, Ka, of greater than or equal to about 10<sup>4 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, or greater than or equal to about 10<sup>5 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, greater than or equal to about 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, greater than or equal to about 10<sup>7 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, or greater than or equal to 10<sup>8 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, or greater than or equal to 10<sup>9 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, or greater than or equal to 10<sup>10 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.

A substantially pure nucleic acid includes isolated forms of the nucleic acid. Of course, this refers to the nucleic acid as originally isolated and does not exclude genes or sequences later added to the isolated nucleic acid by the hand of man.

This term also does not refer to or exclude post-expression modifications of the polypeptide, for example, glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation and the like, as well as other modifications known in the art, both naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring. A polypeptide may be an entire protein, or a subsequence thereof. Particular polypeptides of interest in the context of this invention are amino acid subsequences comprising CDRs and being capable of binding an antigen.

ScFv molecules are known in the art and are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,892,019. In addition, the term &#x201c;modified antibody&#x201d; includes multivalent forms of antibodies (e.g., trivalent, tetravalent, etc., antibodies that bind to three or more copies of the same antigen).

Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations that include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies useful in the present invention may be prepared by the hybridoma methodology first described by Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975), or may be made using recombinant DNA methods in bacterial, eukaryotic animal or plant cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat.

The &#x201c;monoclonal antibodies&#x201d; may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol.

A &#x201c;native sequence&#x201d; polypeptide is one that has the same amino acid sequence as a polypeptide (e.g., antibody) derived from nature (e.g., from any species). Such native sequence polynucleotides and polypeptides can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. A polynucleotide &#x201c;variant&#x201d;, as the term is used herein, is a polynucleotide that typically differs from a polynucleotide specifically disclosed herein in one or more substitutions, deletions, additions and/or insertions. Such variants may be naturally occurring or may be synthetically generated, for example, by modifying one or more of the polynucleotide sequences of the invention and evaluating one or more biological activities of the encoded polypeptide as described herein and/or using any of a number of techniques well known in the art. A polypeptide &#x201c;variant&#x201d;, as the term is used herein, is a polypeptide that typically differs from a polypeptide specifically disclosed herein in one or more substitutions, deletions, additions and/or insertions. Such variants may be naturally occurring or may be synthetically generated, for example, by modifying one or more of the above polypeptide sequences of the invention and evaluating one or more biological activities of the polypeptide as described herein and/or using any of a number of techniques well known in the art. Modifications may be made in the structure of the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention and still obtain a functional molecule that encodes a variant or derivative polypeptide with desirable characteristics. When it is desired to alter the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide to create an equivalent, or even an improved, variant or region of a polypeptide of the invention, one skilled in the art will typically change one or more of the codons of the encoding DNA sequence. For example, certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids in a protein structure without appreciable loss of its ability to bind other polypeptides (e.g., antigens) or cells. Since it is the binding capacity and nature of a protein that defines that protein's biological functional activity, certain amino acid sequence substitutions can be made in a protein sequence, and of course, its underlying DNA coding sequence, and nevertheless obtain a protein with similar properties. It is thus contemplated that various changes may be made in the peptide sequences of the disclosed compositions, or corresponding DNA sequences that encode said peptides without appreciable loss of their biological utility or activity. In many instances, a polypeptide variant will contain one or more conservative substitutions. A &#x201c;conservative substitution&#x201d; is one in which an amino acid is substituted for another amino acid that has similar properties, such that one skilled in the art of peptide chemistry would expect the secondary structure and hydropathic nature of the polypeptide to be substantially unchanged. As outlined above, amino acid substitutions are generally therefore based on the relative similarity of the amino acid side-chain substituents, for example, their hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, charge, size, and the like. Exemplary substitutions that take several of the foregoing characteristics into consideration are well known to those of skill in the art and include: arginine and lysine; glutamate and aspartate; serine and threonine; glutamine and asparagine; and valine, leucine and isoleucine. Amino acid substitutions may further be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity and/or the amphipathic nature of the residues. For example, negatively charged amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid; positively charged amino acids include lysine and arginine; and amino acids with uncharged polar head groups having similar hydrophilicity values include leucine, isoleucine and valine; glycine and alanine; asparagine and glutamine; and serine, threonine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Other groups of amino acids that may represent conservative changes include: (1) ala, pro, gly, glu, asp, gln, asn, ser, thr; (2) cys, ser, tyr, thr; (3) val, ile, leu, met, ala, phe; (4) lys, arg, his; and (5) phe, tyr, trp, his. A variant may also, or alternatively, contain nonconservative changes. In a preferred embodiment, variant polypeptides differ from a native sequence by substitution, deletion or addition of five amino acids or fewer. Variants may also (or alternatively) be modified by, for example, the deletion or addition of amino acids that have minimal influence on the immunogenicity, secondary structure and hydropathic nature of the polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0129">&#x201c;Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable excipient&#x201d; includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. Said excipient does not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward reaction when administered to an animal, preferably a human. For human administration, preparations should meet sterility, pyrogenicity, and general safety and purity standards as required by FDA Office of Biologics standards.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0130">&#x201c;Specificity&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the term &#x201c;specificity&#x201d; refers to the ability to specifically bind (e.g., immunoreact with) a given target, e.g., GARP. A polypeptide may be monospecific and contain one or more binding sites which specifically bind a target, or a polypeptide may be multispecific and contain two or more binding sites which specifically bind the same or different targets. In an embodiment, an antibody of the invention is specific for more than one target. For example, in an embodiment, a multispecific binding molecule of the invention binds to GARP and a second molecule expressed on a tumor cell. Exemplary antibodies which comprise antigen binding sites that bind to antigens expressed on tumor cells are known in the art and one or more CDRs from such antibodies can be included in an antibody of the invention.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0131">&#x201c;Synthetic&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein the term &#x201c;synthetic&#x201d; with respect to polypeptides includes polypeptides which comprise an amino acid sequence that is not naturally occurring. For example, non-naturally occurring polypeptides are modified forms of naturally occurring polypeptides (e.g., comprising a mutation such as an addition, substitution or deletion) or polypeptides which comprise a first amino acid sequence (which may or may not be naturally occurring) that is linked in a linear sequence of amino acids to a second amino acid sequence (which may or may not be naturally occurring) to which it is not naturally linked in nature.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0132">&#x201c;Single-chain Fv&#x201d; also abbreviated as &#x201c;sFv&#x201d; or &#x201c;scFv&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the terms &#x201c;Single-chain Fv&#x201d;, &#x201c;sFv&#x201d; or &#x201c;scFv&#x201d; are antibody fragments that comprise the VH and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains that enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv, see Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994); Borrebaeck 1995, infra.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0133">&#x201c;Variable region&#x201d; or &#x201c;variable domain&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the term &#x201c;variable&#x201d; refers to the fact that certain regions of the variable domains VH and VL differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its target antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called &#x201c;hypervariable loops&#x201d; in each of the VL domain and the VH domain which form part of the antigen binding site. The first, second and third hypervariable loops of the VLambda light chain domain are referred to herein as L1 (&#x3bb;), L2 (&#x3bb;) and L3 (&#x3bb;) and may be defined as comprising residues 24-33 (L1(&#x3bb;), consisting of 9, 10 or 11 amino acid residues), 49-53 L2 (&#x3bb;), consisting of 3 residues) and 90-96 (L3(&#x3bb;), consisting of 6 residues) in the VL domain (Morea et al., Methods 20:267-279 (2000)). The first, second and third hypervariable loops of the VKappa light chain domain are referred to herein as L1(&#x3ba;), L2(&#x3ba;) and L3(&#x3ba;) and may be defined as comprising residues 25-33 (L1(&#x3ba;), consisting of 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 or 13 residues), 49-53 (L2(&#x3ba;), consisting of 3 residues) and 90-97 (L3(&#x3ba;), consisting of 6 residues) in the VL domain (Morea et al., Methods 20:267-279 (2000)). The first, second and third hypervariable loops of the VH domain are referred to herein as H1, H2 and H3 and may be defined as comprising residues 25-33 (HI, consisting of 7, 8 or 9 residues), 52-56 (H2, consisting of 3 or 4 residues) and 91-105 (H3, highly variable in length) in the VH domain (Morea et al., Methods 20:267-279 (2000)). Unless otherwise indicated, the terms L1, L2 and L3 respectively refer to the first, second and third hypervariable loops of a VL domain, and encompass hypervariable loops obtained from both Vkappa and Vlambda isotypes. The terms H1, H2 and H3 respectively refer to the first, second and third hypervariable loops of the VH domain, and encompass hypervariable loops obtained from any of the known heavy chain isotypes, including [gamma], [epsilon], [delta], a or [mu]. The hypervariable loops L1, L2, L3, H1, H2 and H3 may each comprise part of a &#x201c;complementarity determining region&#x201d; or &#x201c;CDR&#x201d;, as defined below.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0134">&#x201c;Valency&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein the term &#x201c;valency&#x201d; refers to the number of potential target binding sites in a polypeptide. Each target binding site specifically binds one target molecule or specific site on a target molecule. When a polypeptide comprises more than one target binding site, each target binding site may specifically bind the same or different molecules (e.g., may bind to different ligands or different antigens, or different epitopes on the same antigen). The subject binding molecules preferably have at least one binding site specific for a human GARP molecule. In particular embodiments the GARP antibodies provided herein may be at least bivalent.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0135">&#x201c;Treating&#x201d; or &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; or &#x201c;alleviation&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the terms &#x201c;treating&#x201d; or &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; or &#x201c;alleviation&#x201d; refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures; wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) the targeted pathologic condition or disorder. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those prone to have the disorder or those in whom the disorder is to be prevented. A subject or mammal is successfully &#x201c;treated&#x201d; for an infection if, after receiving a therapeutic amount of an antibody according to the methods of the present invention, the patient shows observable and/or measurable reduction in or absence of one or more of the following: reduction in the number of pathogenic cells; reduction in the percent of total cells that are pathogenic; and/or relief to some extent, of one or more of the symptoms associated with the specific disease or condition; reduced morbidity and mortality, and improvement in quality of life issues. The above parameters for assessing successful treatment and improvement in the disease are readily measurable by routine procedures familiar to a physician.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0136">&#x201c;TGF-&#x3b2;&#x201d;&#x2014;As used herein, the term TGF-&#x3b2; refers to the three isoforms named TGF-&#x3b2;1, TGF-&#x3b2;2 and TGF-&#x3b2;3. The peptide structures of the TGF-&#x3b2; isoforms are highly similar (homologies on the order of 70-80%). They are all encoded as large protein precursors; TGF-&#x3b2;1 (GenBank Access No: NM_000660 contains 390 amino acids and TGF-&#x3b2;2 (GenBank Access No: NM_001135599 and NM_003238) and TGF-&#x3b2;3 (GenBank Access No: XM_005268028) each contain 412 amino acids. They each have an N-terminal signal peptide of 20-30 amino acids that they require for secretion from a cell, a pro-region (named latency associated peptide or LAP), and a 112-114 amino acid C-terminal region that becomes the mature TGF-&#x3b2; molecule following its release from the pro-region by proteolytic cleavage. After proteolytic cleavage, LAP and mature TGF-&#x3b2; remain non-covalently associated and form the &#x201c;latent&#x201d; TGF-&#x3b2; molecule. In this latent form, mature TGF-&#x3b2; is prevented from binding to the TGF-&#x3b2; receptor by LAP. To exert a signal, mature TGF-&#x3b2; must be released from LAP. Mature TGF-&#x3b2; that is not associated to LAP is called active TGF-&#x3b2;, as it can bind to the TGF-&#x3b2; receptor and transduce a signal.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0137">TGF-&#x3b2;1 has the following amino acid sequence:</p><p id="p-0121" num="0138"><tables id="TABLE-US-00008" num="00008"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="right"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;53)</entry></row><row><entry>MPPSGLRLLPLLLPLLWLLVLTPGRPAAGLSTCKTIDMELVKRKRIEAIR</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>GQILSKLRLASPPSQGEVPPGPLPEAVLALYNSTRDRVAGESAEPEPEPE</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>ADYYAKEVTRVLMVETHNEIYDKFKQSTHSIYMFFNTSELREAVPEPVLL</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>SRAELRLLRLKLKVEQHVELYQKYSNNSWRYLSNRLLAPSDSPEWLSFDV</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>TGVVRQWLSRGGEIEGFRLSAHCSCDSRDNTLQVDINGFTTGRRGDLATI</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>HGMNRPFLLLMATPLERAQHLQSSRHRRALDTNYCFSSTEKNCCVRQLYI</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>DFRKDLGWKWIHEPKGYHANFCLGPCPYIWSLDTQYSKVLALYNQHNPGA</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>SAAPCCVPQALEPLPIVYYVGRKPKVEQLSNMIVRSCKCS.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0122" num="0139">LAP has the following amino acid sequence:</p><p id="p-0123" num="0140"><tables id="TABLE-US-00009" num="00009"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="right"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;54)</entry></row><row><entry>LSTCKTIDMELVKRKRIEAIRGQILSKLRLASPPSQGEVPPGPLPEAVLA</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>LYNSTRDRVAGESAEPEPEPEADYYAKEVTRVLMVETHNEIYDKFKQSTH</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>SIYMFFNTSELREAVPEPVLLSRAELRLLRLKLKVEQHVELYQKYSNNSW</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>RYLSNRLLAPSDSPEWLSFDVTGVVRQWLSRGGEIEGFRLSAHCSCDSRD</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>NTLQVDINGFTTGRRGDLATIHGMNRPFLLLMATPLERAQHLQSSRHRR.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0124" num="0141">Mature TGF-&#x3b2;1 has the following amino acid sequence:</p><p id="p-0125" num="0142"><tables id="TABLE-US-00010" num="00010"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="right"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;55)</entry></row><row><entry>ALDTNYCFSSTEKNCCVRQLYIDFRKDLGWKWIHEPKGYHANFCLGPCPY</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>IWSLDTQYSKVLALYNQHNPGASAAPCCVPQALEPLPIVYYVGRKPKVEQ</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>LSNMIVRSCKCS.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0126" num="0143">One object of the invention is a protein binding to GARP in the presence of TGF-&#x3b2;.

region and CDR sequences may comprise conservative sequence modifications. Conservative sequence modifications refer to amino acid modifications that do not significantly affect or alter the binding characteristics of the antibody containing the amino acid sequence. Such conservative modifications include amino acid substitutions, additions and deletions. Modifications can be introduced into an antibody of the invention by standard techniques known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Conservative amino acid substitutions are typically those in which an amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a side chain with similar physicochemical properties. Specified variable region and CDR sequences may comprise one, two, three, four or more amino acid insertions, deletions or substitutions. Where substitutions are made, preferred substitutions will be conservative modifications. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g. glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g. threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, one or more amino acid residues within the CDR regions of an antibody of the invention can be replaced with other amino acid residues from the same side chain family and the altered antibody can be tested for retained function (i.e., the properties set forth herein) using the assays described herein. anti-hGARP antibodies may also be CDR-grafted antibodies in which the CDRs are derived from a camelid antibody, for example a camelid anti-hGARP antibody raised by active immunization with hGARP.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0301">In an embodiment, the invention provides an antibody that binds essentially the same epitope as the MHGARP8 or LHG10 antibody.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0302">In some embodiments of this invention, anti-hGARP antibodies comprising VH and VL domains, or CDRs thereof may comprise CH1 domains and/or CL domains, the amino acid sequence of which is fully or substantially human. Where the antigen binding polypeptide of the invention is an antibody intended for human therapeutic use, it is typical for the entire constant region of the antibody, or at least a part thereof, to have a fully or substantially human amino acid sequence. Therefore, one or more or any combination of the CH1 domain, hinge region, CH2 domain, CH3 domain and CL domain (and CH4 domain if present) may be fully or substantially human with respect to its amino acid sequence. Advantageously, the CH1 domain, hinge region, CH2 domain, CH3 domain and CL domain (and CH4 domain if present) may all have a fully or substantially human amino acid sequence. In the context of the constant region of a humanized or chimeric antibody, or an antibody fragment, the term &#x201c;substantially human&#x201d; refers to an amino acid sequence identity of at least 90%, or at least 95%, or at least 97%, or at least 99% with a human constant region. The term &#x201c;human amino acid sequence&#x201d; in this context refers to an amino acid sequence which is encoded by a human immunoglobulin gene, which includes germline, rearranged and somatically mutated genes. The invention also contemplates polypeptides comprising constant domains of &#x201c;human&#x201d; sequence which have been altered, by one or more amino acid additions, deletions or substitutions with respect to the human sequence, excepting those embodiments where the presence of a &#x201c;fully human&#x201d; hinge region is expressly required. The presence of a &#x201c;fully human&#x201d; hinge region in the anti-hGARP antibodies of the invention may be beneficial both to minimize immunogenicity and to optimize stability of the antibody. It is considered that one or more amino acid substitutions, insertions or deletions may be made within the constant region of the heavy and/or the light chain, particularly within the Fc region. Amino acid substitutions may result in replacement of the substituted amino acid with a different naturally occurring amino acid, or with a non-natural or modified amino acid. Other structural modifications are also permitted, such as for example changes in glycosylation pattern (e.g. by addition or deletion of N- or O-linked glycosylation sites). Depending on the intended use of the antibody, it may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to its binding properties to Fc receptors, for example to modulate effector function. For example cysteine residue(s) may be introduced in the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved effector function. See Caron et al., J. Exp. Med. 176: 1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, B. J. Immunol. 148:2918-2922 (1992). Alternatively, a GARP antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al., Anti-Cancer Drug Design 3:219-230 (1989). The invention also contemplates immunoconjugates comprising an antibody as described herein conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate). Fc regions may also be engineered for half-life extension, as described by Chan and Carter, 2010 Nature Reviews: Immunology, 10:301-316, incorporated herein by reference. Variant anti-hGARP antibodies in which the Fc region is modified by protein engineering, as described herein, may also exhibit an improvement in efficacy (e.g. in therapeutics/diagnostics), as compared to an equivalent antibody (i.e. equivalent antigen-binding properties) without the Fc modification.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0303">In yet another embodiment, the Fc region is modified to increase the ability of the antibody to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or to increase the affinity of the antibody for an Fc&#x3b3; receptor by modifying one or more amino acids. In still another embodiment, the glycosylation of an antibody is modified. For example, an aglycoslated antibody can be made (i.e., the antibody lacks glycosylation). Glycosylation can be altered to, for example, increase the affinity of the antibody for the GARP target antigen. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by; for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Also envisaged are variant anti-hGARP antibodies having an altered type of glycosylation, such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or a non-fucosylated antibody (as described by Natsume et al., 2009 Drug Design Development and Therapy, 3:7-16) or an antibody having increased bisecting GlcNac structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC activity of antibodies, producing typically 10-fold enhancement of ADCC relative to an equivalent antibody comprising a &#x201c;native&#x201d; human Fc domain. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation enzymatic machinery (as described by Yamane-Ohnuki and Satoh, 2009 mAbs 1(3):230-236).</p><p id="p-0268" num="0304">In an embodiment of the invention, the anti-hGARP antibody comprises an Fc region having the sequence SEQ ID NO: 47.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0305"><tables id="TABLE-US-00027" num="00027"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="right"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;47)</entry></row><row><entry>PKSCDKTHTCPPCPAPELLGGPSVFLFPPKPKDTLMISRTPEVTCVVVDV</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>SHEDPEVKFNWYVDGVEVHNAKTKPREEQYNSTYRVVSVLTVLHQDWLNG</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>KEYKCKVSNKALPAPIEKTISKAKGQPREPQVYTLPPSRDELTKNQVSLT</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>CLVKGFYPSDIAVEWESNGQPENNYKTTPPVLDSDGSFFLYSKLTVDKSR</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>WQQGNVFSCSVMHEALHNHYTQKSLSLSPGK.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0270" num="0306">In another embodiment of the invention, the anti-hGARP antibody comprises the heavy chain constant domain region having the sequence SEQ ID NO: 48, wherein X is N or is mutated into Q to inhibit ADCC.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0307"><tables id="TABLE-US-00028" num="00028"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="right"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;48)</entry></row><row><entry>ASTKGPSVFPLAPSSKSTSGGTAALGCLVKDYFPEPVTVSWNSGALTSGV</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>HTFPAVLQSSGLYSLSSVVTVPSSSLGTQTYICNVNHKPSNTKVDKKVEP</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>KSCDKTHTCPPCPAPELLGGPSVFLFPPKPKDTLMISRTPEVTCVVVDVS</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>HEDPEVKFNWYVDGVEVHNAKTKPREEQYXSTYRVVSVLTVLHQDWLNGK</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>EYKCKVSNKALPAPIEKTISKAKGQPREPQVYTLPPSRDELTKNQVSLTC</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>LVKGFYPSDIAVEWESNGQPENNYKTTPPVLDSDGSFFLYSKLTVDKSRW</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>QQGNVFSCSVMHEALHNHYTQKSLSLSPGK.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0272" num="0308">In an embodiment of the invention, the residue 297 of SEQ ID NO: 48 is aglycosylated.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0309">In another embodiment of the invention, the N residue at the position 297 of SEQ ID NO: 48 is mutated into Q.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0310">In an embodiment of the invention, the anti-hGARP antibody comprises the light chain constant domain region having the sequence SEQ ID NO: 49.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0311"><tables id="TABLE-US-00029" num="00029"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="right"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;49)</entry></row><row><entry>RTVAAPSVFIFPPSDEQLKSGTASVVCLLNNFYPREAKVQWKVDNALQSG</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>NSQESVTEQDSKDSTYSLSSTLTLSKADYEKHKVYACEVTHQGLSSPVTK</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>SFNRGEC.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0276" num="0312">In further embodiments of the invention, anti-hGARP antibodies may be lacking effector function, either because the Fc region of the antibody is of an isotype which naturally lacks effector function, or which exhibits significantly less potent effector function than human IgG1, for example human IgG2 or human IgG4, or because the Fc region of the antibody has been engineered to reduce or substantially eliminate effector function, as described in Armour K L, et al., Eur.

Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab&#x2032;, Fab&#x2032;-SH, F(ab&#x2032;)2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; any antibody fragment that is a polypeptide having a primary structure consisting of one uninterrupted sequence of contiguous amino acid residues (referred to herein as a &#x201c;single-chain antibody fragment&#x201d; or &#x201c;single chain polypeptide&#x201d;), including without limitation (1) single-chain Fv molecules (2) single chain polypeptides containing only one light chain variable domain, or a fragment thereof that contains the three CDRs of the light chain variable domain, without an associated heavy chain moiety and (3) single chain polypeptides containing only one heavy chain variable region, or a fragment thereof containing the three CDRs of the heavy chain variable region, without an associated light chain moiety; and multi-specific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Fragments of the present antibodies can be obtained using standard methods. For instance, Fab or F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragments may be produced by protease digestion of the isolated antibodies, according to conventional techniques. It will be appreciated that immune-reactive fragments can be modified using known methods, for example to slow clearance in vivo and obtain a more desirable pharmacokinetic profile the fragment may be modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Methods for coupling and site-specifically conjugating PEG to a Fab&#x2032; fragment are described in, for example, Leong et al, Cytokines 16 (3): 106-119 (2001) and Delgado et al, Br. J. Cancer 73 (2): 175-182 (1996), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0327">Alternatively, the DNA of a hybridoma producing an antibody of the invention, preferably a MHGARP8-like or LHG10-like antibody, may be modified so as to encode a fragment of the invention. The modified DNA is then inserted into an expression vector and used to transform or transfect an appropriate cell, which then expresses the desired fragment.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0328">In certain embodiments, the DNA of a hybridoma producing an antibody of this invention, preferably a MHGARP8-like or LHG10-like antibody, can be modified prior to insertion into an expression vector, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy- and light-chain constant domains in place of the homologous non-human sequences (e.g., Morrison et al., PNAS pp. 6851 (1984)), or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In that manner, &#x201c;chimeric&#x201d; or &#x201c;hybrid&#x201d; antibodies may be prepared that have the binding specificity of the original antibody. Typically, such non-immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0329">Thus, according to another embodiment, the antibody of this invention, preferably a MHGARP8 or LHG10-like antibody, is humanized. &#x201c;Humanized&#x201d; forms of antibodies according to this invention are specific chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)2, or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from the murine immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary-determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of the original antibody (donor antibody) while maintaining the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity of the original antibody.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0330">In some instances, Fv framework (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin may be replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies can comprise residues that are not found in either the recipient antibody or in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and optimize antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of the original antibody and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a region of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al., Nature, 321, pp. 522 (1986); Reichmann et al, Nature, 332, pp. 323 (1988); Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 3, pp. 394 (1992); Verhoeyen et al. Science, 239, pp. 1534; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. Methods for humanizing the antibodies of this invention are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0331">The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called &#x201c;best-fit&#x201d; method, the sequence of the variable domain of an antibody of this invention is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence that is closed to the mouse sequence is then accepted as the human framework (FR) for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., J. Immunol. 151, pp. 2296 (1993); Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196, pp. 901). Another method uses a particular framework from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework can be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al., PNAS 89, pp. 4285 (1992); Presta et al. J. Immunol., 151 (1993)). It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for GARP and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding. Another method of making &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; monoclonal antibodies is to use a XenoMouse (Abgenix, Fremont, Calif.) as the mouse used for immunization. A XenoMouse is a murine host according to this invention that has had its immunoglobulin genes replaced by functional human immunoglobulin genes. Thus, antibodies produced by this mouse or in hybridomas made from the B cells of this mouse, are already humanized. The XenoMouse is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,963, which is herein incorporated in its entirety by reference.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0332">Human antibodies may also be produced according to various other techniques, such as by using, for immunization, other transgenic animals that have been engineered to express a human antibody repertoire (Jakobovitz et al. Nature 362 (1993) 255), or by selection of antibody repertoires using phage display methods. Such techniques are known to the skilled person and can be implemented starting from monoclonal antibodies as disclosed in the present application.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0333">In an embodiment, Camelidae hypervariable loops (or CDRs) may be obtained by active immunization of a species in the family Camelidae with a desired target antigen.

Thirteen anti-hGARP monoclonals were tested in this assay: the above mentioned nine new monoclonals (MHGARP1 to 9), and commercially available antibody clones Plato-1 (Enzo Life Sciences, catalog No. ALX-804-867), 272G6 (Synaptic Systems, catalog No. 221 111), 50G10 (Synaptic Systems, catalog No. 221 011) and 7B11 (BioLegend, catalog No. 352501). Cells were collected after 24 hours, lysed and submitted to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Gels were blotted on nitrocellulose membranes with the iBlot system (Life Technologies). After blocking, membranes were hybridized with primary antibodies directed against phosphorylated SMAD2 (pSMAD2, Cell Signaling Technologies) or &#x3b2;-ACTIN (SIGMA), then hybridized with secondary HRP-coupled antibodies and revealed with Enhanced ChemiLuminescent (ECL) substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific). The presence of pSMAD2 indicates production of active TGF-&#x3b2;1 by the stimulated Treg clone. ECL signals were quantified by measuring the density of the 55 kDa pSMAD2 and 40 kDa &#x3b2;-ACTIN bands on autoradiographs, using the Image J software.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0383">To examine whether hGARP is required for active TGF-&#x3b2; production by TCR-stimulated Treg cells, a human Treg clone was stimulated through its T cell receptor (TCR), alone or in the presence of anti-hGARP mAbs. Active TGF-&#x3b2; produced by stimulated Tregs triggers an autocrine signal, which leads to the phosphorylation and activation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 transcription factors. The presence of phosphorylated SMAD2 (pSMAD2) was measured by Western Blot (WB) as read-out for active TGF-&#x3b2; production by the stimulated Treg clone. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>, pSMAD2 was reduced more than 10 fold in the presence of MHGARP8.

None of the twelve other anti-hGARP mAbs (eight other in-house produced MHGARP and four commercially available anti-GARP antibodies) inhibited active TGF-&#x3b2; production by the Treg clone.

It was hypothesized that MHGARP8 may recognize an epitope in hGARP that is distinct from the epitopes recognized by the other anti-hGARP mAbs.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0387">With the exception of MHGARP-1, the MHGARP mAbs of the instant application do not recognize murine GARP (mGARP). Plasmids were therefore constructed encoding HA-tagged hGARP, mGARP or hGARP/mGARP chimeras to map the hGARP regions recognized by the mAbs of the instant application. Murine BW cells were transfected and stable clones were derived expressing the HA-tagged proteins (schematically represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3E</figref>). All clones expressed similar levels of HA-tagged protein on the surface, as indicated by similar fluorescence intensities after staining with an anti-HA mAb (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). As expected, all the MHGARP mAbs bound to the clone expressing HA-tagged hGARP, whereas none, except MHGARP-1, bound to the clone expressing HA-tagged mGARP. Four groups of mAbs emerged from the analysis of binding to the HA-tagged hGARP/mGARP chimeras (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). Monoclonal antibodies in the first group (MHGARP-6, -7 and -9) bound none of the chimeras, indicating that they recognize an epitope located between aa 20 and 101 of hGARP (region 20-101). mAbs in the second group (MHGARP-2, -3 and -8) bound to only 1 of the 5 chimeras, and thus recognize an epitope in region 101-141. A third group comprises MHGARP-5, which bound to 2 of the chimeras and therefore recognizes region 141-207. This group probably also contains MHGARP-1, which is cross-reactive but bound these 2 chimeras more efficiently than it bound mGARP or the 3 other chimeras. Finally, mAbs in the fourth group (MHGARP-4 and Plato-1) bound 4 of the 5 chimeras, and thus recognize region 265-333.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0388">Based on the above, the anti-hGARP mAbs were grouped into four families of antibodies that recognize four distinct regions of the hGARP protein. MHGARP-8, which displays neutralizing activity, binds to region 101-141. This region is also recognized by MHGARP-2 and -3, which are not neutralizing. Therefore, the ability to bind region 101-141 is not sufficient to confer neutralizing activity.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0389">To further define the epitopes recognized by MHGARP-2, -3 and -8, the binding of the anti-hGARP antibodies was compared to clones of BW cells expressing hGARP alone (BW+hGARP), or hGARP and hTGF-&#x3b2;1 (BW+hGARP+hTGF-&#x3b2;1). With the notable exception of MHGARP8, all anti-hGARP antibodies stained BW+hGARP+hTGF-&#x3b2;1 with the same intensity as BW+hGARP, indicating that the two clones express the same levels of hGARP on the cell surface. The MHGARP8 antibody in contrast, stained BW+hGARP+hTGF-&#x3b2;1 more intensely than BW+hGARP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). This indicates that although hGARP levels are similar on the two clones, the epitope recognized by MHGARP8 is more abundant on BW+hGARP+hTGF-&#x3b2;1 than on BW+hGARP cells.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0390">A plausible explanation for this observation is that the epitope recognized by MHGARP8 appears only when hGARP is bound to murine (m) or human (h) TGF-&#x3b2;1. This could be due to one of two mechanisms: either the epitope comprises amino-acids from both hGARP and TGF-&#x3b2;1 (mixed conformational epitope), or it comprises amino-acids from hGARP only, but that adopt a different conformation in the presence of TGF-&#x3b2;1 (binding-induced conformational epitope). BW cells express murine TGF-&#x3b2;1, and murine TGF-&#x3b2;1 binds to hGARP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). Therefore, binding of MHGARP8 to BW+hGARP (in the absence of transfected hTGF-&#x3b2;1) could be due to recognition of hGARP/mTGF-&#x3b2;1 complexes.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0391">To explore the hypothesis that MHGARP8 recognizes GARP when it is bound to TGF-&#x3b2;1, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. The different anti-GARP antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate GARP from BW+hGARP+hTGF-&#x3b2;1 cells, then analyzed to determine if TGF-&#x3b2; was co-immunoprecipitated with GARP. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, all anti-GARP antibodies efficiently immunoprecipitated GARP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, top panels). Co-immunoprecipitation of TGF-&#x3b2;1 was observed with MHGARP-6, -7, -8, and -9 mAbs, indicating that these antibodies bind GARP bound to TGF-&#x3b2;1. In contrast, MHGARP-1, -2, -3, -4 and -5 immunoprecipitated GARP as efficiently as the other anti-GARP mAbs, but they did not co-immunoprecipitate TGF-&#x3b2; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, bottom panels). This indicates that MHGARP-1, -2, -3, -4 and -5 recognize free GARP, but not GARP that is bound to TGF-&#x3b2;. It is important to note that MHGARP-2 and -3, which require the GARP<sub>101-141 </sub>region for binding, recognize only free GARP, whereas neutralizing MHGARP8, which also requires GARP<sub>101-141</sub>, recognizes GARP bound to TGF-&#x3b2;.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0392">To confirm this observation, 293T cells, which express low levels of endogenous TGF-&#x3b2;1, were used to co-transfect hGARP with increasing amounts of hTGFB1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>). Binding of MHGARP-1, -2, -3, -4 and -5 decreased dose-dependently when hTGFB1 was co-transfected with hGARP. It was completely abrogated at the highest doses of hTGFB1. This confirms that MHGARP-1 to -5 bind only free GARP. Binding of MHGARP-6, -7, and -9 was not modified by co-transfection of hTGFB1, indicating that these mAbs bind hGARP whether or not it is bound to TGF-&#x3b2;1 (i.e. they bind both free GARP and GARP bound to TGF-&#x3b2;1). In striking contrast, binding of MHGARP8 increased dose-dependently when hTGFB1 was co-transfected with hGARP. This suggests again that in contrast to all other antibodies, MHGARP8 does not bind free GARP, but only GARP bound to TGF-&#x3b2;1.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0393">To demonstrate that MHGARP8 binding requires the presence of TGF-&#x3b2;1, siRNAs were used to silence the expression of TGFB1 in Jurkat cells transduced with hGARP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>). The siRNA against TGFB1 mRNA efficiently reduced expression of TGF-&#x3b2;1, as illustrated by the decrease in surface LAP detected on Jurkat+hGARP cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, right panel). Reduced expression of TGF-&#x3b2;1 in Jurkat+hGARP decreased the binding of the MHGARP8 antibody, but it did not modify the binding of the other anti-GARP antibodies (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, foreground histograms). This confirms that in contrast to the other anti-GARP antibodies, MHGARP8, does not bind free GARP, but only binds GARP in the presence of TGF-&#x3b2;1.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0394">Finally, the unlikely hypothesis that presentation of TGF-&#x3b2; on the cell surface, irrespective of hGARP expression, is sufficient for binding by MHGARP8, was evaluated. In other words, whether MHGARP8 recognizes a mixed or a binding-induced conformational epitope that requires expression of both hGARP and TGF-&#x3b2; was analyzed. For this, 293T cells were transfected with constructs encoding hGARP, mGARP or the hGARP/mGARP chimeras described above, with or without a construct encoding hTGF-&#x3b2;1. Transfected cells were analyzed by FACS to measure binding of the MHGARP8 antibody, and presentation of hTGF-&#x3b2;1 on the cell surface with an anti-hLAP antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>). By comparison to unstransfected cells, transfection of hGARP, mGARP or hGARP/mGARP constructs alone (no hTGFB1) induced low levels of surface LAP, due to low levels of endogenous hTGFB1 expression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, left). Surface LAP levels dramatically increased upon transfection of hTGFB1 in cells transfected with hGARP, mGARP, or any hGARP/mGARP construct (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, left histogram). This indicates that hTGF-&#x3b2;1 is presented on the cell surface by hGARP, by mGARP and by all the hGARP/mGARP chimeras. Importantly, MHGARP8 bound only to the surface of cells transfected with hGARP, or with the hGARP/mGARP constructs encoding amino-acids 101 to 141 of hGARP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, right). It did not bind to cells transfected with hTGFB1 and mGARP, nor to cells transfected with hTGFB1 and hGARP/mGARP constructs that do not encode hGARP101-141 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, right), although these cells presented high levels of LAP on their surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, left). This demonstrates that presentation of TGF-&#x3b2;1 on the cell surface (by mGARP or hGARP/mGARP chimeras) is not sufficient for binding by MHGARP8. Binding of MHGARP8 requires the presence of both hGARP (region 101-141) and TGF-&#x3b2;1 on the cell surface.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0395">As indicated above, MHGARP8 does not bind mGARP. Its binding to hGARP requires a region comprising amino-acids 101 to 141. To further define the epitope recognized by MHGARP8, the sequences of region 101-141 in human and murine GARP were compared. In this region, only 13 amino-acids differ between hGARP and mGARP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, amino-acids highlighted by grey boxes). Three HA-tagged mutant forms of hGARP were constructed. In each mutant (Mut I, Mut II and Mut III), three consecutive amino-acids were replaced by the corresponding amino-acids of the mGARP protein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, black boxes). Stable clones of BW cells transfected with these HA-tagged forms of wild type (WT) or mutant hGARP were derived. All clones expressed similar levels of HA-tagged protein on the surface, as demonstrated by staining with an anti-HA antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, histograms on the right). The clones were then analyzed after staining with MHGARP-2, -3 and -8, i.e., antibodies which require region 101-141 of hGARP for binding. The three antibodies bound to cells expressing WT, Mut I and Mut II forms of hGARP. In contrast, binding was greatly reduced on cells expressing the Mut III form of hGARP, indicating that MHGARP-2, -3 and -8 require amino-acids 137-138-139 of hGARP for binding.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0396">Altogether, the data show that MHGARP8 is the only available anti-GARP antibody that inhibits active TGF-&#x3b2;1 production by human Tregs. This neutralizing activity is linked to binding of MHGARP8 to an epitope that is distinct from those bound by all other anti-GARP antibodies: binding of MHGARP8 requires both region 101-141 of hGARP and the presence of hTGF-&#x3b2;, whereas binding of non-neutralizing antibodies require other regions of hGARP (for MHGARP-1, -4, -5, -6, -7 and -9), or occurs only in the absence of TGF-&#x3b2;1 (for MHGARP-2 and -3). In region hGARP101-141, amino-acids 137 to 139 are required for the binding of MHGARP-2, -3 and -8.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0397">The affinity of the MHGARP8 antibody to immobilized shGARP-TGF&#x3b2; was measured by BIACOR analysis.

When human PBMCs are used instead of HSCs, efficient engraftment of T cells occurs, but is soon accompanied by the development of a xenogeneic Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD). In this model, GvHD results from the activity of human donor cytotoxic T lymphocytes that recognize tissues of the recipient NSG mice as foreign (Shultz, et al. Nature 2012, 12:786-798). The severity of the GvHD can be decreased by co-transferring human Treg cells with human PBMCs (Hannon et al. Transfusion 2014).</p><p id="p-0360" num="0399">Human PBMCs were isolated from total blood of a hemochromatosis donor by centrifugation on density gradients (Lymphoprep&#x2122;), and frozen for later use. Autologous Tregs were generated as follows: CD4+ T cells were isolated from the blood of the same donor using the RosetteSep&#x2122; Human CD4+ T Cell Enrichment Cocktail (StemCell Technologies) and stained with anti-CD4, anti-CD25 and anti-CD127 antibodies coupled to fluorochromes. CD4+CD25hiCD127lo cells were sorted by flow cytometry (&#x3e;99% purity) then stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 coated beads (Dynabeads&#xae; Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 for T-Cell Expansion and Activation, Life Technologies) in the presence of IL-2 (120 IU/ml) during 14 days. These expanded Treg cells were frozen for later use.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0400">NSG mice were irradiated (2.5 Gy) on day &#x2212;1, then injected in the tail vein with human PBMCs (2.7&#xd7;106 per mouse) alone, or mixed with expanded human Tregs (1.4&#xd7;106 per mouse) on day 0. Mice also received weekly i.p. injections of MHGARP8 antibody (400 &#x3bc;g on day &#x2212;1 (day minus 1), 200 &#x3bc;g at later time points), or control PBS. Mice were monitored bi-weekly for GvHD development as indicated in the text.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0401">Human PBMCs with or without Tregs were transferred into NSG mice, and the mice were treated with i.p. injections of MHGARP8 antibody or control PBS. The large number of human Treg cells required for the transfers were obtained through short in vitro amplification of CD4+CD25+CD127lo cells sorted from human PBMCs by flow cytometry. Objective signs of GvHD development in the recipient mice were monitored bi-weekly. We performed two independent experiments, which yielded similar results. In experiment 1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>), signs of GvHD (mean score &#x3e;1) appeared 29 days after injection of human PBMCs (group I; n=2). Disease severity increased quickly, and one of the 2 mice was euthanized for ethical reasons on day 55. In mice injected with PBMCs and Tregs (group II; n=3), the appearance of GvHD was delayed by comparison to PBMCs alone (mean score &#x3e;1 reached after 58 days). This indicates that Tregs, as expected, partially protected NSG mice against GvHD. Importantly, treatment of mice receiving PBMCs and Tregs with the MHGARP8 antibody (group III, n=6) aggravated the disease: signs of GvHD appeared earlier (36 days) than in mice from group II. The effect of MHGARP8 appears to depend on the presence of Tregs, as no difference in disease score was observed between mice receiving PBMCs only (group I) or PBMCs and MHGARP8 (group IV; n=4). This experiment was repeated with a larger number of mice per group (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). Again, co-injection of Tregs with PBMCs delayed the appearance of GvHD by comparison to PBMCs alone (day 46 in group II versus day 28 in group I), and treatment with the MHGARP8 antibody aggravated GvHD in mice receiving PBMCs and Tregs (day 28 in group III) by comparisons to untreated mice (day 46 in group II). Altogether, this shows that MHGARP8 inhibits the immune-suppressive function of human Tregs in vivo.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 5: New Anti-hGARP Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) Using Immunization of Llamas Approach</heading><p id="p-0363" num="0402">Production of Recombinant Soluble GARP-TGF&#x3b2;1 Complex</p><p id="p-0364" num="0403">Human and murine GARP-TGF&#x3b2;1 complex was produced as a soluble complex using a truncated GARP expression construct.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, clone Treg A1 inhibited the proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>&#x2212;</sup>CD127<sup>hi </sup>Th cells by 66% in the absence of anti-hGARP mAb. Suppression was reduced to 36% and 32% in the presence of MHG-8 or LHG-10, respectively, but was not reduced in the presence of 6 other anti-hGARP mAbs. Suppression by clone Treg A1 on another Th target (clone Th A2) was also measured in the presence of MHGARP8, an anti-hTGF-&#x3b2;1 mAb or an isotype control. MHGARP8 (MHG-8) inhibited the in vitro suppressive activity of Treg A1 in a manner similar to that of the anti-TGF-&#x3b2;1 antibody, whereas the isotype control showed no effect (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 8: Epitopes Recognized by Inhibitory Anti-hGARP mAbs</heading><p id="p-0389" num="0428">Only a minority (2/35) of anti-hGARP mAbs block active TGF-&#x3b2; production and suppression by Tregs. This could be due to their ability to bind epitope(s) that are distinct from those bound by non-inhibitory mAbs. Therefore the regions required for binding by inhibitory and non-inhibitory mAbs were mapped.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0429">GARP associates with pro- or latent TGF-&#x3b2;1 to form disulfide-linked GARP/TGF-&#x3b2;1 complexes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> and Stockis 2009 Eur. J. Immunol. 2009. 39: 3315-3322 and Gauthy E et al). We first sought to determine whether anti-hGARP mAbs also bind GARP/TGF-&#x3b2;1 complexes, using co-immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments in murine BW cells transfected with hGARP and hTGFB1. Thirty-two anti-hGARP mAbs were tested: 31 mAbs of the instant invention and the commercially available Plato-1 mAb. All mAbs efficiently immunoprecipitated GARP (top panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, showing IPs with 12 representative mAbs). Pro-TGF-&#x3b2;1, as well as LAP and mature TGF-&#x3b2;1 (i.e. latent TGF-&#x3b2;1) were co-immunoprecipitated with 24 mAbs indicating that they bind GARP/TGF-&#x3b2;1 complexes (6 mAbs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, middle and lower panels). In contrast, 8 mAbs (3 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>) did not co-immunoprecipitate pro- or latent TGF-&#x3b2;1, suggesting they bind free GARP but not GARP/TGF-&#x3b2;1 complexes.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0430">This was confirmed by FACS analyses of transfected 293T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>). Untransfected 293T cells express no GARP and very low levels of endogenous TGF-&#x3b2;1. No latent TGF-&#x3b2; is detected on their surface with an anti-LAP antibody. Transfection of GARP or TGFB1 alone induces no or low surface LAP, respectively, whereas co-transfection of GARP and TGFB1 induces high surface LAP as a result of latent TGF-&#x3b2;1 binding and presentation by GARP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, left histograms). Three groups of anti-hGARP mAbs emerged from the analysis of transfected 293T cells, and are classified in 3 columns in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>. A first group (left column) comprises the 8 mAbs that did not co-immunoprecipitate pro- or latent TGF-&#x3b2;1: they bound 293T cells transfected with hGARP alone, but not with hGARP and hTGFB1. This confirms that these mAbs bind free GARP only, as binding to surface GARP is lost in the presence of TGF-&#x3b2;1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, shows 3 representative mAbs of this group). A second group comprises most other mAbs (19 mAbs, middle column of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>): they bound 293T cells equally well upon transfection with hGARP alone or with hGARP and hTGFB1, indicating that they bind both free GARP and GARP/TGF-&#x3b2;1 complexes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, shows 6 mAbs of this group). Interestingly, a third group of 5 mAbs bound 293T cells transfected with hGARP and hTGFB1, but not cells transfected with hGARP alone (right column of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>). These mAbs bind GARP/TGF-&#x3b2;1 complexes but not free GARP, and include inhibitory MHGARP8 (MHG-8) and LHG-10 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, shows 3 mAbs of this group).</p><p id="p-0392" num="0431">From the above, we concluded that most mAbs bind free GARP only (8/32) or free GARP and GARP/TF-&#x3b2;1 complexes (19/32). Only five mAbs, including inhibitory MHGARP8 (MHG-8) and LHG-10 but also three non-inhibitory mAbs, bind GARP/TGF-&#x3b2;1 complexes, but not free GARP. This pattern of recognition does not explain why only MHGARP8 and LHG-10 are inhibitory.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0432">We next sought to define the regions of hGARP required for binding by the various mAbs. The vast majority of the anti-hGARP mAbs do not cross-react on mouse GARP (mGARP). Therefore plasmids were constructed encoding HA-tagged mGARP/hGARP chimeras (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, left panel) and transfected into 293T cells, with or without hTFGB1 depending on the binding requirements determined above. All chimeras were expressed at similar levels on the surface of 293T cells, as evidenced by staining with an anti-HA mAb (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, histograms on the right). Binding patterns to mGARP/hGARP chimeras (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, 10 representative mAbs) allowed to identify the region of hGARP required for binding by each anti-hGARP mAb. This is summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, where mAbs are distributed in rows corresponding to various regions of hGARP: mAbs in the first row require a region comprising amino-acids 20 to 101 (hGARP<sub>20-101</sub>), mAbs in the second row require hGARP<sub>101-141</sub>, those in the third require hGARP<sub>141-207</sub>, the fourth, hGARP<sub>265-332</sub>, and finally, a fifth group requires hGARP<sub>332-628</sub>. However, even when considering the regions required for binding, the epitope recognized by inhibitory MHGARP8 (named MHG-8 on the figure) and LHG-10 could not be distinguished from that of non-inhibitory mAbs: MHGARP8 and LHG-10, like LHG-3, -12 and -13, bind GARP/TGF-&#x3b2; complexes that contain hGARP<sub>101-141</sub>.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0433">Sequences of mouse and human GARP<sub>101-141 </sub>differ at 14 amino-acid (aa) positions, comprising three clusters of three contiguous positions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, left panel). We constructed three mutated versions of hGARP. In each mutant, a series of three contiguous aa from region 101-141 were replaced by the aa found in mGARP. We transfected 293T cells with the HA-tagged mutants, alone or with hTGFB1 depending on the binding requirement of the mAbs tested. Binding patterns to mutants revealed three types of mAbs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, right panel), which required amino-acids hGARP<sub>111-113</sub>, hGARP<sub>126-127</sub>, or hGARP<sub>137-139 </sub>for binding, respectively. Six mAbs, including MHGARP8 (named MHG-8 on the figure) and LHG-10, required hGARP<sub>137-139 </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>). Whereas four of six can bind free hGARP, MHG-8 and LHG-10 are the only mAbs that require hGARP<sub>137-139 </sub>in the context of GARP/TGF-&#x3b2;1 complexes.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0434">From the above, we concluded that inhibition of TGF-&#x3b2; production by MHGARP8 and LHG-10 is associated with the ability to bind an epitope that is distinct from those recognized by all other, non-inhibitory, anti-hGARP mAbs.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 9: Inhibition of Human Tregs Function by Anti-hGARP In Vivo</heading><p id="p-0396" num="0435">We next sought to evaluate whether inhibitory anti-hGARP mAbs could inhibit human Treg function in vivo. We used a model of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) induced by transfer of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into immuno-compromised NOD/Scid/IL2Rg-(NSG) mice. NSG mice have defective cytokine signaling and lack functional T, B and NK cells, allowing very efficient engraftment of human T cells upon i.v. injection of PBMCs. Thirty to forty days after PBMC transfer, recipient mice develop xenogeneic GVHD, due to the activity of human cytotoxic T lymphocytes against murine tissues (Shultz, Nat Rev Immunol. 2012 November; 12(11):786-98). In this model, co-transfer of human Tregs with human PBMCs attenuates GVHD (Hannon et al. Transfusion. 2014 February; 54(2):353-63), providing a model to test the inhibitory activity of anti-hGARP mAbs on human Tregs in vivo.</p><p id="p-0397" num="0436">We transferred human PBMCs (3&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>/mouse) with or without autologous Tregs (1.5&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>/mouse) in NSG mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>). As a source of human Tregs, we used blood CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup>CD127<sup>lo </sup>cells that had been shortly amplified in vitro, as described above. In addition, mice were injected with MHGARP8 (named MHG-8 on the figure), anti-TGF-&#x3b2;1, an isotype control or PBS, one day before the graft and weekly thereafter. Objective signs of GVHD were monitored bi-weekly, to establish a disease score based on weight loss, reduced mobility, anemia or icterus, and hair loss. We performed four independent experiments (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>), and detailed results are shown for one (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>). Depending on the experiment, onset of disease (mean GVHD score &#x3e;1) was observed 28 to 41 days after PBMC transfer in groups of mice that received no mAb or an isotype control. Co-transfer of Tregs delayed disease, which occurred 46 to 72 days after transfer, indicating that human Tregs were able to suppress human T cell responses against xenogeneic antigens. Administration of MHGARP8 to mice transferred with PBMCs and Tregs abrogated the protective effect of Tregs: disease occurred as early as in mice receiving PBMCs only (28 to 44 days after transfer). Inhibition of Treg suppressive function by MHGARP8 was similar to that observed with a neutralizing anti-TGF-&#x3b2;1 antibody. An isotype control had no effect.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0437">Altogether, this shows that MHGARP8 inhibits the immune-suppressive function of human Tregs in vivo.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0438">We verified that MHGARP-8 did not aggravate GVHD in mice grafted with PBMCs alone, thus that its effect depended on the co-injection of Tregs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). We also examined whether abrogation of Treg protection by MHGARP-8 depended on its ability to block TGF-&#x3b2; production. MHGARP-8 was compared to LHG-10.6, which also blocks TGF-&#x3b2; production by Tregs, and to LHG-3, which does not. Antibody LHG-10.6 is a variant of LHG-10 with increased affinity for GARP/TGF-&#x3b2;1 complexes that was selected by phage display from Fabs in which the heavy chain of LHG-10 was combined to the VK library. Like MHGARP-8, LHG-10.6 aggravated GVHD, whereas non-blocking antibody LHG-3 had no effect (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). This suggested that MHGARP-8 and LHG-10.6 abrogate Treg protection by blocking Treg production of TGF-&#x3b2;1, and not by inducing Treg depletion. To further exclude the latter possibility, a mutated version of LHG-10.6, named LHG-10.6N297Q, was also tested. The N297Q mutation results in loss of Fc glycosylation, thus loss of Fc receptor- and C1q-binding, and consequently loss of ADCC and CDC functions. LHG-10.6N297Q aggravated GVHD in mice grafted with PBMCs and Tregs as potently as LHG-10.6, confirming that anti-GARP antibodies do not act by depleting Tregs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).</p><p id="p-0400" num="0439">Human cytokines in the serum of mice 20 days after cell transfer were measured (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>). Human IL-2 and IFN&#x3b3; were detected at high levels in mice grafted with PBMCs only, indicating a strong xenogeneic activation of human T cells. They were significantly reduced by the cotransfer of Tregs, confirming suppressive activity. MHGARP-8 decreased the suppression by Tregs, but had no effect in mice transferred with PBMCs alone. Finally, IL-10 levels were not increased but instead reduced in the presence of Tregs, suggesting that Tregs do not suppress through production of IL-10 in this model (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>). Noteworthy, effects of MHGARP-8 on suppression of cytokine production were measured at an early time point before disease onset, to preclude confounding effects from severe inflammation that develops in some groups at later time points. This likely explains why the effects of MHGARP-8 are less pronounced on cytokine production than on disease progression.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0440">In spleens collected 20 days after transfer, human hematopoietic cells (hCD45+) comprised mostly T lymphocytes (CD4+ and CD8+), which had considerably proliferated in mice grafted with PBMCs alone. This proliferation was inhibited by the co-transfer of Tregs, an effect that was decreased by MHGARP-8 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>). Notably, the numbers and proportions of Tregs (hCD3+hCD4+hFOXP3+ cells or cells with a demethylated FOXP3i1 allele) were not reduced in mice treated with MHGARP-8. On the contrary, Treg numbers were significantly increased in mice transferred with Tregs and treated with MHGARP-8 as compared to untreated mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>). This suggests that the MHGARP-8-mediated blockade of autocrine TGF-&#x3b2;1 activity favors Treg proliferation, while concomitantly inhibiting Treg function. It also supports the hypothesis that inhibitory anti-GARP mAbs do not act by depleting Tregs.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0441">However, it could still be that inhibitory mAbs deplete a minor subpopulation of Tregs without affecting total Treg numbers. For example, this could occur if only a small proportion of Tregs expressed GARP as a result of activation in this model. In vitro, GARP was shown to be expressed only on activated Tregs. First, the proportions and numbers of GARP+Tregs were measured at several time points after the transfer of human PBMCs&#xb1;Tregs in NSG mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref>). Three days after transfer, approximately 50% of CD4+FOXP3+ cells expressed GARP, indicating that GARP+ cells do not represent a minor subpopulation of Tregs. Proportions of GARP+ cells decreased progressively to 10-20% of CD4+FOXP3+ by day 20, and no difference was observed between untreated mice and mice treated with the anti-GARP mAb LHG-10.6, which is inhibitory, or LHG-3, which is not. The numbers of GARP+Tregs were not reduced in mice treated with either anti-GARP mAb by comparison to untreated mice. They were even increased at day 20 in mice treated with LHG-10.6 compared to all other conditions. Second, another identification procedure for activated human Tregs, as proposed by Miyara et al. was used (M. Miyara, et al. Immunity 30, 899-911 (2009)) who defined these cells as a subset of FOXP3+ Treg cells characterized by high FOXP3 levels and no CD45RA expression (CD4+FOXP3hiCD45RA&#x2212; cells). A subpopulation of human FOXP3hi cells appeared in mice 7 days after the transfer of human PBMCs&#xb1;Tregs. FOXP3hi cells expressed the highest levels of GARP and most were CD45RA&#x2212;. Therefore in vivo, GARP expression was maximal in the activated human CD4+FOXP3hiCD45RA&#x2212; Tregs. The numbers of CD4+FOXP3hiCD45RA&#x2212; cells were not decreased in mice treated with anti-GARP mAbs by comparison to untreated mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref>), confirming that inhibitory anti-GARP mAbs did not act in this model by depleting GARP-expressing cells.</p><p id="p-0403" num="0442">Altogether, these results indicate that the inhibitory anti-GARP mAbs are capable of inhibiting the immunosuppressive activity of human Tregs in vivo without inducing Treg depletion.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">Example 10: X-Ray Crystal Structures of the Fab-Fragment Generated from Antibody MHGARP8 in Complex with the GARP/TGF-&#x3b2; Complex</heading><p id="p-0404" num="0443">The Fab fragment of MHG-8 was prepared by papain digestion of MHG-8 and purified using Protein A affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography.

Refinement</p><p id="p-0412" num="0451">The phase information necessary to determine and analyse the structure was obtained by molecular replacement. The published structures of latent TGFbeta (PDB-ID 3RJR), Leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing nogo receptor interacting protein 1 (PDB-ID 4OQT) and Fab-fragment (PDB-ID 1FNS) were used as a search models. Subsequent model building and refinement was performed according to standard protocols with the software packages CCP4 and COOT. For the calculation of the free R-factor, a measure to crossvalidate the correctness of the final model, about 0.6% of measured reflections were excluded from the refinement procedure (see Table 6). Automatically generated local NCS restraints have been applied (keyword &#x201c;ncsr local&#x201d; of newer REFMAC5 versions). The water model was built with the &#x201c;Find waters&#x201d;-algorithm of COOT by putting water molecules in peaks of the Fo-Fc map contoured at 3.0 followed by refinement with REFMAC5 and checking all waters with the validation tool of COOT. The criteria for the list of suspicious waters were: B-factor greater 80 A2, 2Fo-Fc map less than 1.2 &#x3c3;, distance to closest contact less than 2.3 &#x212b; or more than 3.5 &#x212b;. The suspicious water molecules and those in the ligand binding site (distance to ligand less than 10 &#x212b;) were checked manually.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0452">The occupancy of side chains, which were in negative peaks in the Fo-Fc map (contoured at &#x2212;3.0 &#x3c3;), were set to zero and subsequently to 0.5 if a positive peak occurred after the next refinement cycle. The Ramachandran Plot of the final model shows 79.3% of all residues in the most favoured region, 19.4% in the additionally allowed region, and 1.1% in the generously allowed region. The residues Asn31(L), Ala51(L), Asn31(&#x3ba;), and Ala51(&#x3ba;) are found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (Table 5). They are either confirmed by the electron density map or could not be modelled in another sensible conformation. Statistics of the final structure and the refinement process are listed in Table 6.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0453"><tables id="TABLE-US-00037" num="00037"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="112pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 6</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Resolution [&#x212b;]</entry><entry>145.70-3.15</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Number of reflections (working/test)</entry><entry>82901/490</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>R<sub>cryst </sub>[%]</entry><entry>24.1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>R<sub>free </sub>[%]<sup>2</sup></entry><entry>27.5</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Total number of atoms:</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Protein</entry><entry>25251</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Water</entry><entry>0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x3b2;-D-mannose</entry><entry>44</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x3b2;-D-N-acetyl-glucose</entry><entry>168</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Deviation from ideal geometry:<sup>3</sup></entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Bond lengths [&#x212b;]</entry><entry>0.007</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Bond angles [&#xb0;]</entry><entry>1.26</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Bonded B's [&#x212b;<sup>2</sup>]<sup>4</sup></entry><entry>12.5</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Ramachandran plot:<sup>5</sup></entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Most favoured regions [%]</entry><entry>79.3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Additional allowed regions [%]</entry><entry>19.4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Generously allowed regions [%]</entry><entry>1.1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Disallowed regions [%]</entry><entry>0.1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="left" id="FOO-00011"><sup>1</sup>values as defined in REFMAC5, without sigma cut-off</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="left" id="FOO-00012"><sup>2</sup>Test-set contains 0.6% of measured reflections</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="left" id="FOO-00013"><sup>3</sup>Root mean square deviations from geometric target values</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="left" id="FOO-00014"><sup>4</sup>Calculated with MOLEMAN</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="left" id="FOO-00015"><sup>5</sup>Calculated with PROCHECK</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0415" num="0454">Results</p><p id="p-0416" num="0455">The structure of the Fab:GARP/TGF-&#x3b2; complex was solved at a resolution of 3.15 &#x212b;.</p><p id="p-0417" num="0456">The crystal structure of the Fab:GARP/TGF-&#x3b2; complex allowed the identification of the epitope recognized by the antibody MHGARP8.

Antibodies MHG-8 and LHG-10</heading><p id="p-0421" num="0460">Impact of Mutations in GARP or TGF-&#x3b2;1 on the Binding of Inhibitory Anti-GARP Antibodies MHG-8 and LHG-10 Used in Saturating Conditions.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0461">Resolution of the crystal structure of MHG-8 Fab/GARP/TGF-&#x3b2;1 complexes and analysis with the CONTACT software allowed the identification of 22 amino-acids in GARP, 8 amino-acids in LAP and 6 amino-acids in mature TGF-&#x3b2;1 that are located less than 5 &#x212b; away from an amino-acid of the light or heavy chain of the MHG-8 Fab (Tables 7a, b and c, and Table 8). Directed mutagenesis was used to construct plasmids encoding HA-tagged forms of GARP or TGF-&#x3b2;1 that are mutated at one, two, or three of these 36 positions (all mutations constructed are indicated in Table 8). 293T cells were then transfected with these plasmids and the ability of anti-GARP, anti-LAP or anti-HA antibodies to bind to the GARP/TGF-&#x3b2;1 complexes containing mutated forms of GARP or TGF-&#x3b2;1 was determined by flow cytometry. Antibodies were used at a saturating concentration of 5 &#x3bc;g/ml for labeling. Binding of each antibody to a given mutant GARP/TGF-&#x3b2;1 complex was compared to their binding to wild type (WT) complexes, by determining an I<sub>m/wt </sub>value (i.e. intensity of binding to mutant by comparison to WT). This value was calculated as follows:<br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>I</i><sub>m/wt </sub>of antibody <i>X</i>=[Geom on mutant&#x2212;Geom on control]/[Geom on WT&#x2212;Geom on control]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><br/>where Geom corresponds to the geometric mean of the fluorescence intensity measured by FACS on 293T cells transfected with empty plasmid (control) or plasmids encoding the mutant or WT forms of GARP/TGF-&#x3b2;1 complexes.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0462">The level of residual binding of anti-GARP or anti-LAP antibodies to each mutant was then calculated by comparison to WT, taking into account the expression levels of mutant and WT forms as measured with anti-HA antibodies. Residual binding was calculated as follows:<br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Residual binding by an anti-GARP or anti-LAP antibody=[<i>I</i><sub>m/wt </sub>with anti-GARP or anti-LAP antibody]/[<i>I</i><sub>m/wt </sub>with anti-HA antibody]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><br/>Results obtained on all mutants are detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A-19D</figref> for binding by inhibitory anti-GARP antibodies MHG-8 and LHG-10, non-inhibitory anti-GARP antibody MHG-6, and anti-LAP antibody, respectively.

The avidity of each antibody on the WT and on the various mutated forms of GARP/TGF-&#x3b2;1 complexes was determined by performing FACS analyses of 293T cells transfected as described above, using 5-to-5 serial dilutions of antibodies for labeling (final concentrations of 5, 1, 0.2, 0.04, 0.008 and 0.0016 &#x3bc;g/ml).

Unexpectedly, a few mutations that induced partial loss of binding at 5 &#x3bc;g/ml did not appear to induce reduced avidity. This was the case for mutations Y137H and R143Y in GARP and mutations Y336A and K338E in TGF-&#x3b2;1 for binding by LHG-10. However, in these apparently paradoxical cases, the concentration of 5 &#x3bc;g/ml of LHG-10 used by default as the maximum concentration did not yield a saturated signal.
