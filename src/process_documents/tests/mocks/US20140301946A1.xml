level="1">Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) that signal through FGF receptors (FGFRs) regulate fundamental developmental pathways and are expressed in a wide variety of tissues. FGFs stimulate proliferation, cell migration, differentiation, and play a major role in skeletal and limb development, wound healing, tissue repair, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis (see, e.g., Turner and Crose, Nature Reviews Cancer 10: 116-129 (2010)).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The mammalian FGF family comprises many ligands, which exert their actions through four highly conserved transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4. A typical FGFR has a signal peptide that is cleaved off, three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (Ig domain I, II and III), an acidic box, a transmembrane domain, and a split tyrosine kinase domain (see, e.g., Ullrich and Schlessinger, Cell 61: 203 (1990); Johnson and Williams, Adv. Cancer Res. 60:1-41 (1992)).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally, alternative splicing of the transcribed receptor genes results in a variety of receptor isoforms, including soluble, secreted FGFRs, FGFRs with truncated COOH-terminal domain, FGFRs with either two or three Ig-like domains, as well as FGFR isoforms arising via alternative splicing of the third Ig-like domain occurs only for FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 and specifies the second half of the third Ig-like domain, resulting in either the Mb or the IIIc isoform of the receptor. The 2<sup>nd </sup>and the 3<sup>rd </sup>Ig-like domains of the receptors are necessary and sufficient for ligand binding, whereas the first Ig-like domain is thought to play a role in receptor autoinhibition. Thus, the different receptors and their isoforms display different ligand-binding specificities (see, e.g., Haugsten et al., Mol. Cancer. Res. 8:1439-1452 (2010)).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The FGFs can also bind to heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), besides binding to distinct FGFRs and their splice variants. Thereby a dimeric FGF-FGFR-HSPG ternary complex forms on the cell surface. The ternary complex is stabilized by multiple interactions between the different components in the complex. Two FGF-binding sites, a heparin-binding site, and a receptor-receptor interaction site have been identified within the Ig-like domains II and III of the receptor. (Haugsten et al., 2010).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Binding of FGFs to FGFRs induces receptor dimerization, which enables transphosphorylation of a tyrosine in the activation loop of the kinase domain. The active FGFRs have been shown to phosphorylate multiple intracellular proteins such as FRS2, and PLC&#x3b3; (Eswarakumar et al., Cytokine Growth Factor Rev 16:139-149 (2005)). FGFR signaling produces distinct biological responses in different cell types, ranging from stimulation of cell proliferation and survival to growth arrest, migration, and differentiation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="2">FGFRs and Cancer</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">FGF signaling mediates a powerful combination of effects: self-sufficiency in growth/survival, neoangiogenesis and tumor cell migration. Consequently, FGF signaling has the potential of being strongly oncogenic once the tight regulation exerted on its physiological functions is lost (see, e.g., Heinzle et al., Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 15(7):829-846 (2011)).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Gene amplification and/or overexpression of FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR4 has been implicated in breast cancer (Penault-Llorca et al., Int J Cancer 1995; Theillet et al., Genes Chrom. Cancer 1993; Adnane et al., Oncogene 1991; Jaakola et al., Int J Cancer 1993; Yamada et al., Neuro Res 2002). Overexpression of FGFR1 and FGFR4 is also associated with pancreatic adenocarcinomas and astrocytomas (Kobrin et al., Cancer Research 1993; Yamanaka et al., Cancer Research 1993; Shah et al., Oncogene 2002; Yamaguchi et al., PNAS 1994; Yamada et al., Neuro Res 2002). Prostate cancer has also been related to FGFR1 overexpression (Giri et al., Clin Cancer Res 1999).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In general FGFR2 and FGFR1 are more commonly deregulated by gene amplification. In gastric cancer, an amplified FGFR2 gene is associated with poor prognosis (Kunii et al., Cancer Res. 68:2340-2348 (2008)). A FGFR2-IIIb to Inc switch can also be a sign of tumor progression, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and high invasiveness in bladder and prostate cancers. Switching in this case substitutes a Mb receptor variant that exerts anti-tumorigenic activity with a protumorigenic Inc receptor (see, e.g., Heinzle et al., 2011). So far FGFR2 mutations have been implicated in skin, endometrial, ovary, and lung cancer. FGFR4 mutations have been implicated in rhabdomyosarcoma, lung, and breast cancer (see, e.g., Heinzle et al., 2011).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Antibody Drug Conjugates</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Antibody drug conjugates (&#x201c;ADCs&#x201d;) have been used for the local delivery of cytotoxic agents in the treatment of cancer (see e.g., Lambert, Cuff. Opinion In Pharmacology 5:543-549, 2005). ADCs allow targeted delivery of the drug moiety where maximum efficacy with minimal toxicity may be achieved. As more ADCs show promising clinical results, there is an increased need to develop new therapeutics for cancer therapy.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides antibody drug conjugates of the formula Ab-(L-(D)<sub>m</sub>)<sub>n</sub>, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein Ab is an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to both human FGFR2 and FGFR4; L is a linker; D is a drug moiety; m is an integer from 1 to 8; and n is an integer from 1 to 10.

For example, C<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl refers to an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Alkyl groups may be straight or branched. Representative branched alkyl groups have one, two, or three branches. Examples of alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl (n-propyl and isopropyl), butyl (n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, and t-butyl), pentyl (n-pentyl, isopentyl, and neopentyl), and hexyl.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; as used herein refers to a polypeptide of the immunoglobulin family that is capable of binding a corresponding antigen non-covalently, reversibly, and in a specific manner. For example, a naturally occurring IgG antibody is a tetramer comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (C1q) of the classical complement system.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; includes, but is not limited to, monoclonal antibodies, human antibodies, humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, and anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention). The antibodies can be of any isotype/class (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), or subclass (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">&#x201c;Complementarity-determining domains&#x201d; or &#x201c;complementary-determining regions (&#x201c;CDRs&#x201d;) interchangeably refer to the hypervariable regions of VL and VH. The CDRs are the target protein-binding site of the antibody chains that harbors specificity for such target protein. There are three CDRs (CDR1-3, numbered sequentially from the N-terminus) in each human VL or VH, constituting about 15-20% of the variable domains. The CDRs are structurally complementary to the epitope of the target protein and are thus directly responsible for the binding specificity. The remaining stretches of the VL or VH, the so-called framework regions, exhibit less variation in amino acid sequence (Kuby, Immunology, 4th ed., Chapter 4. W.H. Freeman &#x26; Co., New York, 2000).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0036">The positions of the CDRs and framework regions can be determined using various well known definitions in the art, e.g., Kabat, Chothia, international ImMunoGeneTics database (IMGT) (on the worldwide web at imgt.cines.fr/), and AbM (see, e.g., Johnson et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 29:205-206 (2001); Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917 (1987); Chothia et al., Nature, 342:877-883 (1989); Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227:799-817 (1992); Al-Lazikani et al., J. Mol. Biol., 273:927-748 (1997)). Definitions of antigen combining sites are also described in the following: Ruiz et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 28:219-221 (2000); and Lefranc, M. P., Nucleic Acids Res., 29:207-209 (2001); MacCallum et al., J. Mol. Biol., 262:732-745 (1996); and Martin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:9268-9272 (1989); Martin et al., Methods Enzymol., 203:121-153 (1991); and Rees et al., In Sternberg M. J. E. (ed.), Protein Structure Prediction, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 141-172 (1996).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0037">Both the light and heavy chains are divided into regions of structural and functional homology. The terms &#x201c;constant&#x201d; and &#x201c;variable&#x201d; are used functionally. In this regard, it will be appreciated that the variable domains of both the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chain portions determine antigen recognition and specificity. Conversely, the constant domains of the light chain (CL) and the heavy chain (CH1, CH2 or CH3) confer important biological properties such as secretion, transplacental mobility, Fc receptor binding, complement binding, and the like. By convention, the numbering of the constant region domains increases as they become more distal from the antigen binding site or amino-terminus of the antibody. The N-terminus is a variable region and at the C-terminus is a constant region; the CH3 and CL domains actually comprise the carboxy-terminal domains of the heavy and light chain, respectively.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0038">The term &#x201c;antigen binding fragment&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to one or more portions of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically interact with (e.g., by binding, steric hindrance, stabilizing/destabilizing, spatial distribution) an epitope of an antigen. Examples of binding fragments include, but are not limited to, single-chain Fvs (scFv), camelid antibodies, disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv), Fab fragments, F(ab&#x2032;) fragments, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; a F(ab)<sub>2 </sub>fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody; a dAb fragment (Ward et al., Nature 341:544-546, 1989), which consists of a VH domain; and an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR), or other epitope-binding fragments of an antibody.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0039">Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (&#x201c;scFv&#x201d;); see, e.g., Bird et al., Science 242:423-426, 1988; and Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85:5879-5883, 1988). Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term &#x201c;antigen binding fragment.&#x201d; These antigen binding fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0040">Antigen binding fragments can also be incorporated into single domain antibodies, maxibodies, minibodies, nanobodies, intrabodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, v-NAR and bis-scFv (see, e.g., Hollinger and Hudson, Nature Biotechnology 23:1126-1136, 2005). Antigen binding fragments can be grafted into scaffolds based on polypeptides such as fibronectin type III (Fn3) (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,703,199, which describes fibronectin polypeptide monobodies).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0041">Antigen binding fragments can be incorporated into single chain molecules comprising a pair of tandem Fv segments (VH-CH1-VH-CH1) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions (Zapata et al., Protein Eng. 8:1057-1062, 1995; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0042">The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; or &#x201c;monoclonal antibody composition&#x201d; as used herein refers to polypeptides, including antibodies and antigen binding fragments that have substantially identical amino acid sequence or are derived from the same genetic source. This term also includes preparations of antibody molecules of single molecular composition. A monoclonal antibody composition displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0043">The term &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, includes antibodies having variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from sequences of human origin. Furthermore, if the antibody contains a constant region, the constant region also is derived from such human sequences, e.g., human germline sequences, or mutated versions of human germline sequences or antibody containing consensus framework sequences derived from human framework sequences analysis, for example, as described in Knappik et al., J. Mol. Biol. 296:57-86, 2000).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0044">The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo, or a conservative substitution to promote stability or manufacturing).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">The term &#x201c;recognize&#x201d; as used herein refers to an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that finds and interacts (e.g., binds) with its epitope, whether that epitope is linear or conformational. The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; refers to a site on an antigen to which an antibody or antigen binding fragment of the invention specifically binds. Epitopes can be formed both from contiguous amino acids or noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of a protein. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are typically retained on exposure to denaturing solvents, whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost on treatment with denaturing solvents. An epitope typically includes at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation. Methods of determining spatial conformation of epitopes include techniques in the art, for example, x-ray crystallography and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (see, e.g., Epitope Mapping Protocols in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 66, G.

Within each antigenic site, the variable region of the antibody &#x201c;arm&#x201d; interacts through weak non-covalent forces with antigen at numerous sites; the more interactions, the stronger the affinity.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0047">The term &#x201c;isolated antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities. An isolated antibody that specifically binds to one antigen may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens. Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">The term &#x201c;corresponding human germline sequence&#x201d; refers to the nucleic acid sequence encoding a human variable region amino acid sequence or subsequence that shares the highest determined amino acid sequence identity with a reference variable region amino acid sequence or subsequence in comparison to all other all other known variable region amino acid sequences encoded by human germline immunoglobulin variable region sequences. The corresponding human germline sequence can also refer to the human variable region amino acid sequence or subsequence with the highest amino acid sequence identity with a reference variable region amino acid sequence or subsequence in comparison to all other evaluated variable region amino acid sequences. The corresponding human germline sequence can be framework regions only, complementarity determining regions only, framework and complementarity determining regions, a variable segment (as defined above), or other combinations of sequences or subsequences that comprise a variable region. Sequence identity can be determined using the methods described herein, for example, aligning two sequences using BLAST, ALIGN, or another alignment algorithm known in the art. The corresponding human germline nucleic acid or amino acid sequence can have at least about 90%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity with the reference variable region nucleic acid or amino acid sequence. Corresponding human germline sequences can be determined, for example, through the publicly available international ImMunoGeneTics database (IMGT) (on the worldwide web at imgt.cines.fr/) and V-base (on the worldwide web at vbase.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">The phrase &#x201c;specifically binds&#x201d; or &#x201c;selectively binds,&#x201d; when used in the context of describing the interaction between an antigen (e.g., a protein) and an antibody, antibody fragment, or antibody-derived binding agent, refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the antigen in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics, e.g., in a biological sample, e.g., a blood, serum, plasma or tissue sample. Thus, under certain designated immunoassay conditions, the antibodies or binding agents with a particular binding specificity bind to a particular antigen at least two times the background and do not substantially bind in a significant amount to other antigens present in the sample. In one embodiment, under designated immunoassay conditions, the antibody or binding agent with a particular binding specificity binds to a particular antigen at least ten (10) times the background and does not substantially bind in a significant amount to other antigens present in the sample. Specific binding to an antibody or binding agent under such conditions may require the antibody or agent to have been selected for its specificity for a particular protein. As desired or appropriate, this selection may be achieved by subtracting out antibodies that cross-react with molecules from other species (e.g., mouse or rat) or other subtypes. Alternatively, in some embodiments, antibodies or antibody fragments are selected that cross-react with certain desired molecules.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">A variety of immunoassay formats may be used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein (see, e.g., Harlow &#x26; Lane, Using Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual (1998), for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity). Typically a specific or selective binding reaction will produce a signal at least twice over the background signal and more typically at least 10 to 100 times over the background.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">The term &#x201c;equilibrium dissociation constant (KD, M)&#x201d; refers to the dissociation rate constant (kd, time-1) divided by the association rate constant (ka, time-1, M-1). Equilibrium dissociation constants can be measured using any known method in the art. The antibodies of the present invention generally will have an equilibrium dissociation constant of less than about 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>or 10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M, for example, less than about 10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>M or 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M, in some embodiments, less than about 10<sup>&#x2212;11 </sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>M or 10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>M.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">The term &#x201c;bioavailability&#x201d; refers to the systemic availability (i.e., blood/plasma levels) of a given amount of drug administered to a patient. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time (rate) and total amount (extent) of drug that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; refers to the genera or species of active pharmaceutical agents included in a method or composition, as well as any excipients inactive for the intended purpose of the methods or compositions. In some embodiments, the phrase &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; expressly excludes the inclusion of one or more additional active agents other than an antibody drug conjugate of the invention. In some embodiments, the phrase &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; expressly excludes the inclusion of one or more additional active agents other than an antibody drug conjugate of the invention and a second co-administered agent.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">The term &#x201c;amino acid&#x201d; refers to naturally occurring, synthetic, and unnatural amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g., hydroxyproline, &#x3b3;-carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refer to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an &#x3b1;-carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">The term &#x201c;conservatively modified variant&#x201d; applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are &#x201c;silent variations,&#x201d; which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid that encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">For polypeptide sequences, &#x201c;conservatively modified variants&#x201d; include individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a polypeptide sequence which result in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the invention. The following eight groups contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: 1) Alanine (A), Glycine (G); 2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E); 3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); 4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K); 5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); 6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W); 7) Serine (S), Threonine (T); and 8) Cysteine (C), Methionine (M) (see, e.g., Creighton, Proteins (1984)). In some embodiments, the term &#x201c;conservative sequence modifications&#x201d; are used to refer to amino acid modifications that do not significantly affect or alter the binding characteristics of the antibody containing the amino acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">The term &#x201c;optimized&#x201d; as used herein refers to a nucleotide sequence that has been altered to encode an amino acid sequence using codons that are preferred in the production cell or organism, generally a eukaryotic cell, for example, a yeast cell, a <i>Pichia </i>cell, a fungal cell, a <i>Trichoderma </i>cell, a Chinese Hamster Ovary cell (CHO) or a human cell. The optimized nucleotide sequence is engineered to retain completely or as much as possible the amino acid sequence originally encoded by the starting nucleotide sequence, which is also known as the &#x201c;parental&#x201d; sequence.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">The terms &#x201c;percent identical&#x201d; or &#x201c;percent identity,&#x201d; in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refers to the extent to which two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same. Two sequences are &#x201c;identical&#x201d; if they have the same sequence of amino acids or nucleotides over the region being compared. Two sequences are &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; if two sequences have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same (i.e., 60% identity, optionally 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% identity over a specified region, or, when not specified, over the entire sequence), when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window, or designated region as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection. Optionally, the identity exists over a region that is at least about 30 nucleotides (or 10 amino acids) in length, or more preferably over a region that is 100 to 500 or 1000 or more nucleotides (or 20, 50, 200 or more amino acids) in length.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">A &#x201c;comparison window&#x201d;, as used herein, includes reference to a segment of any one of the number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting of from 20 to 600, usually about 50 to about 200, more usually about 100 to about 150 in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482c (1970), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see, e.g., Brent et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2003).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">Two examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402, 1977; and Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410, 1990, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always &#x3e;0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always &#x3c;0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a word length (W) of 11, an expectation (E) or 10, M=5, N=&#x2212;4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a word length of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henikoff, (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=S, N=&#x2212;4, and a comparison of both strands.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin and Altschul, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5787, 1993). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">The percent identity between two amino acid sequences can also be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller, Comput. Appl. Biosci. 4:11-17, 1988) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. In addition, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined using the Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:444-453, 1970) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at www.gcg.com), using either a Blossom 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">Other than percentage of sequence identity noted above, another indication that two nucleic acid sequences or polypeptides are substantially identical is that the polypeptide encoded by the first nucleic acid is immunologically cross reactive with the antibodies raised against the polypeptide encoded by the second nucleic acid, as described below. Thus, a polypeptide is typically substantially identical to a second polypeptide, for example, where the two peptides differ only by conservative substitutions. Another indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the two molecules or their complements hybridize to each other under stringent conditions, as described below. Yet another indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the same primers can be used to amplify the sequence.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">The term &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; is used herein interchangeably with the term &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d; and refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid, and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Examples of such analogs include, without limitation, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, methyl phosphonates, chiral-methyl phosphonates, 2-O-methyl ribonucleotides, peptide-nucleic acids (PNAs).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, as detailed below, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., (1991) Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081; Ohtsuka et al., (1985) J.

Typically, it refers to the functional relationship of a transcriptional regulatory sequence to a transcribed sequence. For example, a promoter or enhancer sequence is operably linked to a coding sequence if it stimulates or modulates the transcription of the coding sequence in an appropriate host cell or other expression system. Generally, promoter transcriptional regulatory sequences that are operably linked to a transcribed sequence are physically contiguous to the transcribed sequence, i.e., they are cis-acting. However, some transcriptional regulatory sequences, such as enhancers, need not be physically contiguous or located in close proximity to the coding sequences whose transcription they enhance.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">The terms &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and non-naturally occurring amino acid polymer.

The linkage can be covalent bonds, or non-covalent interactions such as through electrostatic forces. Various linkers, known in the art, can be employed in order to form the immunoconjugate. Additionally, the immunoconjugate can be provided in the form of a fusion protein that may be expressed from a polynucleotide encoding the immunoconjugate. As used herein, &#x201c;fusion protein&#x201d; refers to proteins created through the joining of two or more genes or gene fragments which originally coded for separate proteins (including peptides and polypeptides). Translation of the fusion gene results in a single protein with functional properties derived from each of the original proteins.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">The term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; includes human and non-human animals.

For example, the drug moiety can be an anti-cancer agent, such as a cytotoxin. In certain embodiments, a drug moiety is selected from a V-ATPase inhibitor, a HSP90 inhibitor, an IAP inhibitor, an mTor inhibitor, a microtubule stabilizer, a microtubule destabilizer, an auristatin, a dolastatin, a maytansinoid, a MetAP (methionine aminopeptidase), an inhibitor of nuclear export of proteins CRM1, a DPPIV inhibitor, an inhibitor of phosphoryl transfer reactions in mitochondria, a protein synthesis inhibitor, a kinase inhibitor, a CDK2 inhibitor, a CDK9 inhibitor, a proteasome inhibitor, a kinesin inhibitor, an HDAC inhibitor, a DNA damaging agent, a DNA alkylating agent, a DNA intercalator, a DNA minor groove binder and a DHFR inhibitor.

Furthermore, peptides are composed of &#x3b1;-amino acids and peptidic bonds, which chemically are amide bonds between the carboxylate of one amino acid and the amino group of a second amino acid. Other amide bonds, such as the bond between a carboxylate and the s-amino group of lysine, are understood not to be peptidic bonds and are considered non-cleavable.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0151">Some linkers can be cleaved by esterases, i.e. esterase cleavable linkers. Again, only certain esters can be cleaved by esterases present inside or outside of cells. Esters are formed by the condensation of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Simple esters are esters produced with simple alcohols, such as aliphatic alcohols, and small cyclic and small aromatic alcohols.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0152">Procharged linkers are derived from charged cross-linking reagents that retain their charge after incorporation into an antibody drug conjugate.

In one embodiment, the antibody is provided in a reaction vessel, and the drug (e.g., DM1 or DM4) is added to the reaction vessel immediately following providing the antibody to the vessel. In another embodiment, the antibody is provided in a reaction vessel, and the drug (e.g., DM1 or DM4) is added to the reaction vessel after a time interval following providing the antibody to the vessel (e.g., about 5 minutes, about 10 minutes, about 20 minutes, about 30 minutes, about 40 minutes, about 50 minutes, about 1 hour, about 1 day or longer after providing the cell-binding agent to the space). The drug (e.g., DM1 or DM4) can be added quickly (i.e., within a short time interval, such as about 5 minutes, about 10 minutes) or slowly (such as by using a pump).</p><p id="p-0174" num="0158">The mixture comprising the antibody and the drug (e.g., DM1 or DM4) can then be contacted with the cross-linking agent (e.g., SMCC, Sulfo-SMCC, SPDB, Sulfo-SPDB or CX1-1) either immediately after contacting the antibody with the drug (e.g., DM1 or DM4) or at some later point (e.g., about 5 minutes to about 8 hours or longer) after contacting the antibody with the drug (e.g., DM1 or DM4). For example, in one embodiment, the cross-linking agent (e.g., SMCC, Sulfo-SMCC, SPDB, Sulfo-SPDB or CX1-1) is added to the mixture comprising the antibody and the drug (e.g., DM1 or DM4) immediately after the addition of the drug (e.g., DM1 or DM4) to the reaction vessel comprising the antibody.

The quenching step is typically performed prior to purification of the conjugate. In one embodiment, the mixture is quenched by contacting the mixture with a quenching reagent. As used herein, the &#x201c;quenching reagent&#x201d; refers to a reagent that reacts with the free drug (e.g., DM1 or DM4) and/or cross-linking agent (e.g., SMCC, Sulfo-SMCC, SPDB, Sulfo-SPDB or CX1-1). In one embodiment, maleimide or haloacetamide quenching reagents, such as 4-maleimidobutyric acid, 3-maleimidopropionic acid, N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetamide, or iodoacetamidopropionic acid, can be used to ensure that any unreacted group (such as thiol) in the drug (e.g., DM1 or DM4) is quenched. The quenching step can help prevent the dimerization of the drug (e.g., DM1). The dimerized DM1 can be difficult to remove. Upon quenching with polar, charged thiol-quenching reagents (such as 4-maleimidobutyric acid or 3-maleimidopropionic acid), the excess, unreacted DM1 is converted into a polar, charged, water-soluble adduct that can be easily separated from the covalently-linked conjugate during the purification step. Quenching with non-polar and neutral thiol-quenching reagents can also be used. In one embodiment, the mixture is quenched by contacting the mixture with a quenching reagent that reacts with the unreacted cross-linking agent (e.g., SMCC, Sulfo-SMCC, SPDB, Sulfo-SPDB or CX1-1). For example, nucleophiles can be added to the mixture in order to quench any unreacted SMCC. The nucleophile preferably is an amino group containing nucleophile, such as lysine, taurine and hydroxylamine.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0161">In a preferred embodiment, the reaction (i.e., contacting the antibody with the drug (e.g., DM1 or DM4) and then cross-linking agent (e.g., SMCC, Sulfo-SMCC, SPDB, Sulfo-SPDB or CX1-1)) is allowed to proceed to completion prior to contacting the mixture with a quenching reagent. In this regard, the quenching reagent is added to the mixture about 1 hour to about 48 hours (e.g., about 1 hour, about 2 hours, about 3 hours, about 4 hours, about 5 hours, about 6 hours, about 7 hours, about 8 hours, about 9 hours, about 10 hours, about 11 hours, about 12 hours, about 13 hours, about 14 hours, about 15 hours, about 16 hours, about 17 hours, about 18 hours, about 19 hours, about 20 hours, about 21 hours, about 22 hours, about 23 hours, about 24 hours, or about 25 hours to about 48 hours) after the mixture comprising the antibody and the drug (e.g., DM1 or DM4) is contacted with the cross-linking agent (e.g., SMCC, Sulfo-SMCC, SPDB, Sulfo-SPDB or CX1-1).</p><p id="p-0178" num="0162">Alternatively, the mixture is quenched by lowering the pH of the mixture to about 5.0 (e.g., 4.8, 4.9, 5.0, 5.1 or 5.2).

Alternatively, the pH is lowered to about 4.0 (e.g., 3.8, 3.9, 4.0, 4.1 or 4.2) to about 6.0 (e.g., 5.8, 5.9, 6.0, 6.1 or 6.2), about 4.0 to about 5.0, about 4.5 (e.g., 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 or 4.7) to about 5.0.

Identification of Epitopes and Antibodies That Bind to the Same Epitope</heading><p id="p-0222" num="0205">The present invention provides antibodies and antibody fragments (e.g., antigen binding fragments) that bind to an epitope of 160-189 (KMEKRLHAVPAANTVKFRCPAGGNPMPTMR; SEQ ID NO:136) and 198-216 (KMEKRLHAVPAANTVKFRC; SEQ ID NO:141) amino acids (numbered according to P21802-3) of human FGFR2.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0206">In some aspects, the present invention provides antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., antigen binding fragments) that recognize amino acids at positions 173 (Asn), 174 (Thr), 175 (Val), 176 (Lys), 178 (Arg), 208 (Lys), 209 (Val), 210 (Arg), 212 (Gln), 213 (H is), 217 (Ile), 219 (Glue) of human FGFR2 as shown in SEQ ID NO:137. In another embodiment, the present invention provides antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., antigen binding fragments) that recognize amino acids at least in positions 176 (Lys) and 210 (Arg) of human FGFR2 as shown in SEQ ID NO:137.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0207">The present invention also provides antibodies and antibody fragments (e.g., antigen binding fragments) that bind to the same epitope as do the anti-FGFR2/4 antibodies described in Table 1. Additional antibodies and antibody fragments (e.g., antigen binding fragments) can therefore be identified based on their ability to cross-compete (e.g., to competitively inhibit the binding of, in a statistically significant manner) with other antibodies of the invention in FGFR2 and/or FGFR4 binding assays. The ability of a test antibody to inhibit the binding of antibodies and antibody fragments (e.g., antigen binding fragments) of the present invention to a FGFR2 and/or FGFR4 protein (e.g., human FGFR2 and/or FGFR4) demonstrates that the test antibody can compete with that antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., antigen binding fragments) for binding to FGFR2 and/or FGFR4; such an antibody may, according to non-limiting theory, bind to the same or a related (e.g., a structurally similar or spatially proximal) epitope on the FGFR2 and/or FGFR4 protein as the antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., antigen binding fragments) with which it competes. In a certain embodiment, the antibody that binds to the same epitope on FGFR2 and/or FGFR4 as the antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., antigen binding fragments) of the present invention is a human or humanized monoclonal antibody. Such human or humanized monoclonal antibodies can be prepared and isolated as described herein.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="2">2. Further Alteration of the Framework of Fc Region</heading><p id="p-0225" num="0208">The present invention provides site-specific labeled immunoconjugates. The immunoconjugates of the invention may comprise modified antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof that further comprise modifications to framework residues within VH and/or VL, e.g. to improve the properties of the antibody. Typically such framework modifications are made to decrease the immunogenicity of the antibody. For example, one approach is to &#x201c;back-mutate&#x201d; one or more framework residues to the corresponding germline sequence. More specifically, an antibody that has undergone somatic mutation may contain framework residues that differ from the germline sequence from which the antibody is derived. Such residues can be identified by comparing the antibody framework sequences to the germline sequences from which the antibody is derived. To return the framework region sequences to their germline configuration, the somatic mutations can be &#x201c;back-mutated&#x201d; to the germline sequence by, for example, site-directed mutagenesis. Such &#x201c;back-mutated&#x201d; antibodies are also intended to be encompassed by the invention.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0209">Another type of framework modification involves mutating one or more residues within the framework region, or even within one or more CDR regions, to remove T-cell epitopes to thereby reduce the potential immunogenicity of the antibody. This approach is also referred to as &#x201c;deimmunization&#x201d; and is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030153043 by Carr et al.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0210">In addition or alternative to modifications made within the framework or CDR regions, antibodies of the invention may be engineered to include modifications within the Fc region, typically to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody, such as serum half-life, complement fixation, Fc receptor binding, and/or antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, an antibody of the invention may be chemically modified (e.g., one or more chemical moieties can be attached to the antibody) or be modified to alter its glycosylation, again to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody. Each of these embodiments is described in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0211">In one embodiment, the hinge region of CH1 is modified such that the number of cysteine residues in the hinge region is altered, e.g., increased or decreased. This approach is described further in U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,425 by Bodmer et al. The number of cysteine residues in the hinge region of CH1 is altered to, for example, facilitate assembly of the light and heavy chains or to increase or decrease the stability of the antibody.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0212">In another embodiment, the Fc hinge region of an antibody is mutated to decrease the biological half-life of the antibody. More specifically, one or more amino acid mutations are introduced into the CH2-CH3 domain interface region of the Fc-hinge fragment such that the antibody has impaired Staphylococcyl protein A (SpA) binding relative to native Fc-hinge domain SpA binding. This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,745 by Ward et al.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0213">In yet other embodiments, the Fc region is altered by replacing at least one amino acid residue with a different amino acid residue to alter the effector functions of the antibody. For example, one or more amino acids can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has an altered affinity for an effector ligand but retains the antigen-binding ability of the parent antibody. The effector ligand to which affinity is altered can be, for example, an Fc receptor or the C1 component of complement. This approach is described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821 and 5,648,260, both by Winter et al.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0214">In another embodiment, one or more amino acids selected from amino acid residues can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has altered C1q binding and/or reduced or abolished complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). This approach is described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551 by Idusogie et al.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0215">In another embodiment, one or more amino acid residues are altered to thereby alter the ability of the antibody to fix complement. This approach is described in, e.g., the PCT Publication WO 94/29351 by Bodmer et al. In a specific embodiment, one or more amino acids of an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof of the present invention are replaced by one or more allotypic amino acid residues, such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> for the IgG1 subclass and the kappa isotype. Allotypic amino acid residues also include, but are not limited to, the constant region of the heavy chain of the IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 subclasses as well as the constant region of the light chain of the kappa isotype as described by Jefferis et al., MAbs. 1:332-338 (2009).</p><p id="p-0233" num="0216">In yet another embodiment, the Fc region is modified to increase the ability of the antibody to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or to increase the affinity of the antibody for an Fc&#x3b3; receptor by modifying one or more amino acids. This approach is described in, e.g., the PCT Publication WO 00/42072 by Presta. Moreover, the binding sites on human IgG1 for Fc&#x3b3;R1, Fc&#x3b3;RII, Fc&#x3b3;RIII and FcRn have been mapped and variants with improved binding have been described (see Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591-6604, 2001).</p><p id="p-0234" num="0217">In still another embodiment, the glycosylation of an antibody is modified. For example, an aglycosylated antibody can be made (i.e., the antibody lacks glycosylation). Glycosylation can be altered to, for example, increase the affinity of the antibody for &#x201c;antigen.&#x201d; Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,714,350 and 6,350,861 by Co et al.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0218">Additionally or alternatively, an antibody can be made that has an altered type of glycosylation, such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or an antibody having increased bisecting GlcNac structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the invention to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. For example, EP 1,176,195 by Hang et al. describes a cell line with a functionally disrupted FUT8 gene, which encodes a fucosyl transferase, such that antibodies expressed in such a cell line exhibit hypofucosylation. PCT Publication WO 03/035835 by Presta describes a variant CHO cell line, Lecl3 cells, with reduced ability to attach fucose to Asn(297)-linked carbohydrates, also resulting in hypofucosylation of antibodies expressed in that host cell (see also Shields et al., (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740). PCT Publication WO 99/54342 by Umana et al. describes cell lines engineered to express glycoprotein-modifying glycosyl transferases (e.g., beta(1,4)&#x2014;N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII)) such that antibodies expressed in the engineered cell lines exhibit increased bisecting GlcNac structures which results in increased ADCC activity of the antibodies (see also Umana et al., Nat. Biotech. 17:176-180, 1999).</p><p id="p-0236" num="0219">In another embodiment, the antibody is modified to increase its biological half-life. Various approaches are possible. For example, one or more of the following mutations can be introduced: T252L, T254S, T256F, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,375 to Ward. Alternatively, to increase the biological half-life, the antibody can be altered within the CH<sub>1 </sub>or CL region to contain a salvage receptor binding epitope taken from two loops of a CH2 domain of an Fc region of an IgG, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,869,046 and 6,121,022 by Presta et al.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">3. Production of the FGFR2/4 Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0237" num="0220">Anti-FGFR2/4 antibodies and antibody fragments (e.g., antigen binding fragments) thereof can be produced by any means known in the art, including but not limited to, recombinant expression, chemical synthesis, and enzymatic digestion of antibody tetramers, whereas full-length monoclonal antibodies can be obtained by, e.g., hybridoma or recombinant production. Recombinant expression can be from any appropriate host cells known in the art, for example, mammalian host cells, bacterial host cells, yeast host cells, insect host cells, etc.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0221">The invention further provides polynucleotides encoding the antibodies described herein, e.g., polynucleotides encoding heavy or light chain variable regions or segments comprising the complementarity determining regions as described herein.

They can also encode both a variable region and a constant region of the antibody. Some of the polynucleotide sequences encode a polypeptide that comprises variable regions of both the heavy chain and the light chain of one of the exemplified mouse anti-FGFR2 and/or FGFR4 antibody. Some other polynucleotides encode two polypeptide segments that respectively are substantially identical to the variable regions of the heavy chain and the light chain of one of the mouse antibodies.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0224">The polynucleotide sequences can be produced by de novo solid-phase DNA synthesis or by PCR mutagenesis of an existing sequence (e.g., sequences as described in the Examples below) encoding an anti-FGFR2/4 antibody or its binding fragment. Direct chemical synthesis of nucleic acids can be accomplished by methods known in the art, such as the phosphotriester method of Narang et al., Meth. Enzymol. 68:90, 1979; the phosphodiester method of Brown et al., Meth. Enzymol. 68:109, 1979; the diethylphosphoramidite method of Beaucage et al., Tetra.

Introducing mutations to a polynucleotide sequence by PCR can be performed as described in, e.g., PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification, H. A. Erlich (Ed.), Freeman Press, NY, N.Y., 1992; PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications, Innis et al. (Ed.), Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1990; Mattila et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 19:967, 1991; and Eckert et al., PCR Methods and Applications 1:17, 1991.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0225">Also provided in the invention are expression vectors and host cells for producing the anti-FGFR2/4 antibodies described above. Various expression vectors can be employed to express the polynucleotides encoding the anti-FGFR2/4 antibody chains or binding fragments. Both viral-based and nonviral expression vectors can be used to produce the antibodies in a mammalian host cell. Nonviral vectors and systems include plasmids, episomal vectors, typically with an expression cassette for expressing a protein or RNA, and human artificial chromosomes (see, e.g., Harrington et al., Nat Genet. 15:345, 1997). For example, nonviral vectors useful for expression of the anti-FGFR2/4 polynucleotides and polypeptides in mammalian (e.g., human) cells include pThioHis A, B &#x26; C, pcDNA3.1/His, pEBVHis A, B &#x26; C (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.), MPSV vectors, and numerous other vectors known in the art for expressing other proteins. Useful viral vectors include vectors based on retroviruses, adenoviruses, adenoassociated viruses, herpes viruses, vectors based on SV40, papilloma virus, HBP Epstein Barr virus, vaccinia virus vectors and Semliki Forest virus (SFV). See, Brent et al., supra; Smith, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 49:807, 1995; and Rosenfeld et al., Cell 68:143, 1992.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0226">The choice of expression vector depends on the intended host cells in which the vector is to be expressed. Typically, the expression vectors contain a promoter and other regulatory sequences (e.g., enhancers) that are operably linked to the polynucleotides encoding an anti-FGFR2/4 antibody chain or fragment. In some embodiments, an inducible promoter is employed to prevent expression of inserted sequences except under inducing conditions. Inducible promoters include, e.g., arabinose, lacZ, metallothionein promoter or a heat shock promoter. Cultures of transformed organisms can be expanded under noninducing conditions without biasing the population for coding sequences whose expression products are better tolerated by the host cells. In addition to promoters, other regulatory elements may also be required or desired for efficient expression of an anti-FGFR2/4 antibody chain or fragment. These elements typically include an ATG initiation codon and adjacent ribosome binding site or other sequences. In addition, the efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of enhancers appropriate to the cell system in use (see, e.g., Scharf et al., Results Probl. Cell Differ. 20:125, 1994; and Bittner et al., Meth. Enzymol., 153:516, 1987). For example, the SV40 enhancer or CMV enhancer may be used to increase expression in mammalian host cells.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0227">The expression vectors may also provide a secretion signal sequence position to form a fusion protein with polypeptides encoded by inserted anti-FGFR2/4 antibody sequences. More often, the inserted anti-FGFR2/4 antibody sequences are linked to a signal sequences before inclusion in the vector. Vectors to be used to receive sequences encoding anti-FGFR2/4 antibody light and heavy chain variable domains sometimes also encode constant regions or parts thereof. Such vectors allow expression of the variable regions as fusion proteins with the constant regions thereby leading to production of intact antibodies or fragments thereof. Typically, such constant regions are human.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0228">The host cells for harboring and expressing the anti-FGFR2/4 antibody chains can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. <i>E. coli </i>is one prokaryotic host useful for cloning and expressing the polynucleotides of the present invention. Other microbial hosts suitable for use include bacilli, such as <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, and other enterobacteriaceae, such as <i>Salmonella, Serratia</i>, and various <i>Pseudomonas </i>species. In these prokaryotic hosts, one can also make expression vectors, which typically contain expression control sequences compatible with the host cell (e.g., an origin of replication). In addition, any number of a variety of well-known promoters will be present, such as the lactose promoter system, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, a beta-lactamase promoter system, or a promoter system from phage lambda. The promoters typically control expression, optionally with an operator sequence, and have ribosome binding site sequences and the like, for initiating and completing transcription and translation. Other microbes, such as yeast, can also be employed to express anti-FGFR2/4 polypeptides of the invention. Insect cells in combination with baculovirus vectors can also be used.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0229">In some preferred embodiments, mammalian host cells are used to express and produce the anti-FGFR2/4 polypeptides of the present invention. For example, they can be either a hybridoma cell line expressing endogenous immunoglobulin genes (e.g., the myeloma hybridoma clones as described in the Examples) or a mammalian cell line harboring an exogenous expression vector (e.g., the SP2/0 myeloma cells exemplified below). These include any normal mortal or normal or abnormal immortal animal or human cell. For example, a number of suitable host cell lines capable of secreting intact immunoglobulins have been developed, including the CHO cell lines, various Cos cell lines, HeLa cells, myeloma cell lines, transformed B-cells and hybridomas. The use of mammalian tissue cell culture to express polypeptides is discussed generally in, e.g., Winnacker, From Genes to Clones, VCH Publishers, N.Y., N.Y., 1987. Expression vectors for mammalian host cells can include expression control sequences, such as an origin of replication, a promoter, and an enhancer (see, e.g., Queen et al., Immunol Rev. 89:49-68, 1986), and necessary processing information sites, such as ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and transcriptional terminator sequences. These expression vectors usually contain promoters derived from mammalian genes or from mammalian viruses. Suitable promoters may be constitutive, cell type-specific, stage-specific, and/or modulatable or regulatable. Useful promoters include, but are not limited to, the metallothionein promoter, the constitutive adenovirus major late promoter, the dexamethasone-inducible MMTV promoter, the SV40 promoter, the MRP polIII promoter, the constitutive MPSV promoter, the tetracycline-inducible CMV promoter (such as the human immediate-early CMV promoter), the constitutive CMV promoter, and promoter-enhancer combinations known in the art.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0230">Methods for introducing expression vectors containing the polynucleotide sequences of interest vary depending on the type of cellular host. For example, calcium chloride transfection is commonly utilized for prokaryotic cells, whereas calcium phosphate treatment or electroporation may be used for other cellular hosts (see generally Sambrook et al., supra). Other methods include, e.g., electroporation, calcium phosphate treatment, liposome-mediated transformation, injection and microinjection, ballistic methods, virosomes, immunoliposomes, polycation:nucleic acid conjugates, naked DNA, artificial virions, fusion to the herpes virus structural protein VP22 (Elliot and O'Hare, Cell 88:223, 1997), agent-enhanced uptake of DNA, and ex vivo transduction. For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression will often be desired. For example, cell lines which stably express anti-FGFR2 and/or FGFR4 antibody chains or binding fragments can be prepared using expression vectors of the invention which contain viral origins of replication or endogenous expression elements and a selectable marker gene. Following introduction of the vector, cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media before they are switched to selective media. The purpose of the selectable marker is to confer resistance to selection, and its presence allows growth of cells which successfully express the introduced sequences in selective media. Resistant, stably transfected cells can be proliferated using tissue culture techniques appropriate to the cell type.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">Therapeutic and Diagnostic Uses</heading><p id="p-0248" num="0231">The antibodies, antibody fragments (e.g., antigen binding fragments), and antibody drug conjugates of the invention are useful in a variety of applications including, but not limited to, treatment of cancer, such as solid cancers.

Briefly, cells were cultured in a tissue culture incubator at 37&#xb0; C. with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in culture medium as recommended by the supplier. On the day of the assay, cells were washed twice with PBS (Lonza, catalog #17516C), prior to being treated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco catalog #25300) for 5 min and resuspension in the recommended culture medium. Cells were then counted and seeded in 96 well plates (Costar catalog #3940 or Corning catalog #3340) at densities of 2600-3600 cells/well in 100 &#x3bc;l of cell culture medium. A duplicate plate was generated for a day 0 measurement and all plates were incubated in a tissue culture incubator at 37&#xb0; C. with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>overnight. Medium only wells were also generated to act as negative controls. Following this incubation, 50 &#x3bc;l/well of Cell titer Glo reagent (Promega catalog #G7573) was added to the day 0 plates, which were then shaken gently for 10 min and the resulting luminescence intensity was measured using a Perkin Elmer EnVision 2101 plate reader.

However, in contrast, both 12433-MCC-DM1 and 12433-SPDB-DM4 were highly active against the SNU16 xenograft model at the doses administered, suggesting that anti-tumor effects of anti-FGFR ADCs can be obtained with different linkers.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0352">The pharmacokinetics (PK) of anti-FGFR ADCs was evaluated in SNU16 tumor-bearing mice following a single IV dose of 3 mg/kg. PK samples were collected at 1 h, 24 h, 72 h, 168 h, and 336 h post dose. In all studies, serum concentrations of both &#x201c;total&#x201d; antibody and &#x201c;antibody drug conjugate (ADC)&#x201d; were measured in all animal species using validated ELISA methods. The &#x201c;total&#x201d; fraction refers to the measurement of the antibody with or without the conjugated DM1, whereas the ADC fraction refers to the measurement of DM1 conjugated antibody only (&#x2267;1 DM1 molecule). In all studies, no appreciable differences were observed between clearance of the ADC and total antibody fractions. A summary of the PK properties of the ADCs is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (D)-(E). When the ADC clearance following a single 3 mg/kg dose in SNU16 tumor bearing mice was compared to the observed anti-tumor effect, it was found that the ADCs with the greatest anti-tumor activity (&#x3e;40% tumor regression) were all cleared at a rate of less than 45 ml/d/kg (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (F)).</p><heading id="h-0061" level="1">Example 8</heading><heading id="h-0062" level="1">Assessment of Signaling Activity of Unconjugated and Conjugated Antibodies In Vitro Using FGFR2-Amplified Cell Lines</heading><p id="p-0390" num="0353">The ability of the unconjugated and SMCC-DM1 conjugated anti-FGFR2 antibodies to modulate FGFR signaling in FGFR2-amplified cell lines was evaluated. In initial studies, the effect of the 12433, 12425 and 10164 antibodies in SNU16 (ATCC catalog #CRL-5974) cells was determined. Briefly, cells were seeded in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS in 12 well CellBind plates (Costar catalog #3336) and incubated overnight in a tissue culture incubator at 37&#xb0; C. with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

These data suggest that combining FGFR ADCS with small molecule inhibitors of FGFR signaling (e.g. BGJ398, TKI258, ponatinib, AZD4547) can improve anti-tumor responses.</p><p id="p-0406" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00015" num="00015"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 15</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Effect of anti-FGFR agents on tumor and host parameters in CHGA119-tumor </entry></row><row><entry>bearing mice</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="105pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Host response</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Tumor response</entry><entry>Mean</entry><entry/><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Mean</entry><entry>body</entry><entry>% body</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>tumor</entry><entry>weight</entry><entry>weight</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>volume</entry><entry>change </entry><entry>change</entry><entry>Survival</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>T/C</entry><entry>Regression</entry><entry>change</entry><entry>(g &#xb1;</entry><entry>(mean &#xb1;</entry><entry>(survivors/</entry></row><row><entry>Treatment</entry><entry>(%)</entry><entry>(%)</entry><entry>(mm<sup>3 </sup>&#xb1; SEM)</entry><entry>SEM)</entry><entry>SEM)</entry><entry>total)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Vehicle</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2009;1168 &#xb1; 204</entry><entry>&#x2212;1.3 &#xb1; 0.3</entry><entry>&#x2212;5.7 &#xb1; 1.4</entry><entry>8/8</entry></row><row><entry>IgG-MCC-DM1</entry><entry>111</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2009;1301 &#xb1; 243</entry><entry>&#x2212;1.7 &#xb1; 0.6</entry><entry>&#x2212;7.6 &#xb1; 2.7</entry><entry>8/8</entry></row><row><entry>12425-MCC-DM1</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2003;&#x2009;&#x2009;43 &#xb1; 35</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2009;0.6 &#xb1; 0.2</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2009;2.5 &#xb1; 1.0</entry><entry>8/8</entry></row><row><entry>BGJ398</entry><entry>33</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2002;&#x2009;&#x2009;386 &#xb1; 169</entry><entry>&#x2212;0.8 &#xb1; 0.7</entry><entry>&#x2212;3.7 &#xb1; 3&#x2009;&#x2002;</entry><entry>8/8</entry></row><row><entry>12425-MCC-</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>94</entry><entry>&#x2002;&#x2212;223 &#xb1; 32</entry><entry>&#x2212;3.7 &#xb1; 3.8</entry><entry>&#x2212;4.3 &#xb1; 3.8</entry><entry>7/8</entry></row><row><entry>DM1 + BGJ398</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0071" level="1">Example 13</heading><heading id="h-0072" level="1">Effect of Dose Fractionation on In Vivo Efficacy of FGFR ADC</heading><p id="p-0407" num="0367">To better understand the role 12425-MCC-DM1 C<sub>max </sub>(peak exposure) or C<sub>avg </sub>(average exposure over a dosing interval) play in its antitumor activity, a time-dose fractionation experiment was conducted using the SNU16 xenograft model. A range of dose schedule intervals and dose levels yielding a predicted fixed total exposure over a fixed treatment duration were studied. At certain dose levels, FGFR2ADCs exhibit nonlinear PK due to TMDD (see example 19). Therefore, in order to maintain a fixed total exposure across all dose schedule intervals and dose levels, PK modeling predicted that a larger total dose of 12425-MCC-DM1 would be required when administered at a lower, more frequent dose schedule as TMDD would be more pronounced at lower doses. PK modeling predicted that 12425-MCC-DM1 administered at 3 mg/kg q3w*2, 2.5 mg/kg q2w*3, 1.5 mg/kg qw*6, and 0.7 mg/kg q3d*14 would achieve similar total exposure.</p><p id="p-0408" num="0368">Female nude mice were implanted subcutaneously with 10&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells in a suspension containing 50% phenol red-free matrigel (BD Biosciences) in Hank's balanced salt solution.

In brief, Kato-III cells were stained with Calcein acetoxy-methyl ester (Calcein-AM; Sigma-Aldrich catalog #17783-5MG), washed twice, pipetted into a 96-well microtiterplate (96 well, U-bottomed, clear plastic; Corning Costar, catalog #650 160) at a concentration of 5000 cells per well and pre-incubated for 10 min with a serial dilution of the above mentioned antibodies and proteins (from 50,000 to 0.003 &#x3bc;g per ml) before adding the effector cells. In order to calculate the antibody specific lysis of the target cells, a parallel incubation of target cells only without antibody or effector cells served as a baseline and negative control, whereas the positive control or maximal lysis or hundred percent specific lysis was determined by lysis of target cells only with a 1% Triton-X 100 solution. Following a co-incubation of target and effector cells in a ratio of one to five, the microtiterplate was centrifuged and an aliquot of the supernatant fluid was transferred to another microtiterplate (96 well, flat-bottomed, black with clear bottom; Corning Costar, catalog #3904) and the concentration of free Calcein in solution was determined with a fluorescence counter (Victor 3 multilabel counter, Perkin Elmer). Results are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> (A) and it was observed that all tested antibodies mediated ADCC to a varying extent. The N297A<sub>&#x2014;</sub>12425, carrying no glycosylation in the Fc-part of the antibody and thus lacking the binding to the CD16a receptor of the effector cells, did not mediate any ADCC and served as a specific negative control. The constant and protein-concentration independent killing of target cells is due to a unspecific background, natural killing activity of the NK3.3 cells against the Kato-III cells. The antibody 12433 mediated the highest specific lysis of target cells with about sixty percent (signal deduced the background lysis of Kato-III cells by NK3.3 cells), whereas the antibodies 12425 and 10164 reached a specific lysis of about fifty-five percent (signal deduced the background lysis of Kato-III cells by NK3.3 cells). The potency (the concentration at the half maximal killing of each dose response curve; effective concentration 50, EC<sub>50</sub>) of all three molecules was similar. In a similar series of experiments, the ability of the naked antibody 12425 to induce ADCC was compared 12425-MCC-DM1. No differences between the naked 12425 and 12425-MCC-DM1 were observed (data not shown) suggesting that DM1 conjugation does not appreciably impair the ability of the naked antibody to induce ADCC.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0372">In additional studies, the ability of the unconjugated anti-FGFR2 antibodies to bind the complement factor C1q was evaluated. The binding of the complement factor C1q is the initial step leading to complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and cell lysis in vivo. In these studies the surface of the wells of 96-well microtiterplates (Nunc, Maxisorp, catalog #439454) were coated with serial dilutions of the antibodies 12433, 12425, N297A 12425 and 10164 over night at 4&#xb0; C. in the dark (all in a concentration range from 25 to 0.02 &#x3bc;g/ml). The commercially available antibody, Rituximab served as a positive control. In order to monitor the amount of bound antibody analyte on the microtiterplate, this procedure was performed twice per plate utilizing the second dilution (in triplicate) for determining the coating efficacy of the analyte to the plate. C1q binding was quantified by adding a constant concentration of C1q (Sigma; Complement component C1q catalog #C1740-1 mg) and detected using a polyclonal goat-anti-human C1q antibody conjugated to Horse Radish Peroxidase HRP (AbD Serotec; Sheep Anti-Human C1q:HRP; Catalogue number 2221-5004P). The control of the coating efficiency was determined in the second dilution series with a peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-human IgG antibody fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch; catalog #109-036-003; AffiniPure F(ab&#x2032;2) fragment Goat Anti-Human IgG (H+L)). Both were visualized using the TMB substrate (TMB Peroxidase EIA Substrate Kit; Bio-Rad; catalog #172-1067) with subsequent measurement of optical density at 450 nm with a UV-Vis Spectroscope (Molecular Devices; SpectramaxPro 340). Results are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> (B). The maximal amount of C1q protein bound to the tested antibodies was the same for all analytes. The amount of antibody that was bound to the microtiterplate was the same for all analytes except for the 10164 antibody, which reached only around 50% of the other molecules. The potency (the concentration at the half maximal binding of each dose response curve; effective concentration 50, EC<sub>50</sub>) of 12433, 10164 and Rituximab was about the same. The EC<sub>50 </sub>of the 12425 antibody was a factor of 3 higher and the EC<sub>50 </sub>of the N297A<sub>&#x2014;</sub>12425 was a factor of about 8 higher. Given the result that 10164 did not coat equally well to the microtiterplate as the other antibodies did, the observed result in C1q binding implicates an approximate double capacity of 10164 in binding to the C1q protein.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0373">Further to the assessment of C1q binding, the ability of unconjugated anti-FGFR2 antibodies 12433, 10164 12425 and N297A<sub>&#x2014;</sub>12425 to trigger complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was evaluated. Kato-III cells (target cells; ATCC catalogues number HTB-103) were equally distributed into the wells of a 96-well microtiterplate (Costar; sterile, white, 96-well flat bottomed cell culture plates, catalog #3610) at a concentration of 10000 cells per well and pre-incubated for 10 min with a serial dilution of the above mentioned antibodies before adding the effector reagent. The effector reagent used in this study was rabbit complement (PelFreez; catalog #31060-1), which was pipetted onto the Kato-III cells at a final dilution of one to six. Following a two hour incubation in a humidified cell culture incubator at 37&#xb0; C., the microtiterplate was centrifuged, supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was dissolved in reconstituted CellTiterGlo (Promega; CellTiterGlo Luminescence Kit, catalog #G7572). Luminescence was quantified in a multilabel reader (Perkin Elmer; Victor 3). Results are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> (C) for all tested antibodies.

This effect was specific to the ADC, as the unconjugated 12425 antibody was inactive (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (A)). Furthermore, no activity was observed following administration of an FGFR2 specific antibody (10164) or ADC (10164-MCC-DM1), suggesting that the effect is driven by FGFR4 expression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (A)). This is consistent with the lack of detectable FGFR2 expression on these cells as assessed by FACs (data not shown).

Such liabilities can include glycosylation sites, un-paired cysteines, potential deamidation sites etc. To reduce the risk of such potential liabilities, mutations can be introduced to remove one or more of these liabilities. For example, potential deamidation sites can be replaced either alone or in conjunction with other structural changes. Examples of potential deamidation sites include DG in heavy chain CDR2 of 10164 and 12425 (see Table 1). These residues can be mutated to other appropriate amino acids. By way of non-limiting example, the aspartic acid (D) in 10164 HCDR2 can be mutated to glutamic acid (E) or threonine (T). In 12425, the HCDR2 glycine (G) can be mutated to another amino acid, such as alanine (A).</p><p id="p-0436" num="0392">It should also be appreciated that where an antibody differs from its respective germline sequence at the amino acid level, the antibody can be mutated back to its germline sequence. Such corrective mutations can occur at one or more positions and be generated using standard molecular biology techniques or by gene synthesis. By way of non-limiting example, the heavy chain sequence of 12425 heavy chain (SEQ ID NO:9, see Table 1) differs from the corresponding germline sequence by an E to a Q at position 1, and the light chain (SEQ ID No: 17) differs from the corresponding germline by a T for a V at position 85. Thus the amino acids in 12425 can be modified at any or all of these sites.</p><p id="p-0437" num="0393">The chemistry employed to generate the antibody drug conjugates described in this application relies on conjugation to lysine (K) residues in the antibody sequence. Where these lysine residues exist within regions involved in epitope recognition, for example, in CDR regions, if significant conjugation occurs at these sites, the ability of the antibody drug conjugate to bind to its intended target could be altered. To mitigate this potential risk, such lysine residues can be mutated to alternative appropriate amino acids, such as arginine, asparagine or glutamine. One lysine is present in both the heavy chain CDR2 and CDR3 regions of 12425. Either one or more of these lysines can be mutated to alternative residues, such as arginine, asparagine or glutamine.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0394">Several of the changes described above were introduced into the 12425 antibody to yield the antibody 20562 (Table 1). This antibody was compared to 12425 for its ability to bind to FGFR2, its ability to inhibit the proliferation of FGFR2-amplified cell lines, such as SNU16 and to cause an anti-tumor effect against SNU16 cells in vivo. The affinity of 20562 to human FGFR2Mb and FGFR4 was found to be similar to that of 12425 undersimilar assay conditions (20562 FGFR2Mb affinity estimate: 9 nM; human FGFR4 affinity estimate: 3.3 nM). Employing the methodology described in example 6, similar to 12425-MCC-DM1, 20562-MCC-DM1 was also a potent inhibitor of the proliferation of SNU16 cells in vitro (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> (A)). To assess the potency of 20437-MCC-DM1 in vivo, female nude mice were implanted subcutaneously with 10&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells in a suspension containing 50% phenol red-free matrigel (BD Biosciences) in Hank's balanced salt solution. The total injection volume containing cells in suspension was 200 Mice were enrolled in the study seven days post implantation with an average tumor volume of 217.1 mm<sup>3</sup>. After being randomly assigned to one of five groups (n=6/group), mice received PBS (10 ml/kg) or a 3 mg/kg i.v. dose of 12425-MCC-DM1 or 20562-MCC-DM1. Tumors were calipered twice per week (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(B)</figref>). Both 12425-MCC-DM1 and its variant 20562-MCC-DM1 had similar activity in vivo against the FGFR2 amplified SNU16 xenograft. These data suggest that it is possible to remove the DG site of the parent antibody without impacting in vivo activity as an ADC.</p><heading id="h-0087" level="1">Example 21</heading><heading id="h-0088" level="1">Generation and Characterization of Affinity Matured FGFR ADCs</heading><p id="p-0439" num="0395">To evaluate the effect of affinity on the biological activity of selected anti-FGFR antibodies, affinity optimization was performed on the 12433, 10164 and 12425 clones. In these studies, the L-CDR3 and H-CDR2 regions were optimized in parallel by cassette mutagenesis using trinucleotide directed mutagenesis (Virnekas et al., 1994 Nucleic Acids Research 22: 5600-5607), while the framework regions were kept constant. Prior to cloning for affinity maturation, parental Fab fragments were transferred from the corresponding expression vector pM&#xae;x11 into the CysDisplay&#x2122; vector pMORPH&#xae;30 via XbaI/EcoRI.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0396">For optimizing L-CDR3 of parental Fab fragments, the L-CDR3 of the binder was removed and replaced by a repertoire of diversified L-CDR3s. For each parental Fab, a second library set with diversified H-CDR2 has been generated. For each maturation library (LCDR3 and HCDR2), antibody-displaying phages were prepared and phage titers were determined by spot-titration. Amplification of the library was performed as described elsewhere (Rauchenberger et al., 2003 J Biol Chem 278: 38194-38205). For quality control, single clones were randomly picked and sequenced.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0397">For the selection of affinity improved binders phage derived from maturation libraries were subjected to three rounds of solution pannings using biotinylated human FGFR2. Stringency was increased by lowering the antigen concentration in each panning round (Low et al., 1996 J Mol Biol 260(3): 359-368). In addition to antigen reduction, off-rate selection (Hawkins et al., 1992 J Mol Biol 226: 889-896) was performed. This was combined with prolonged washing steps at RT. The general panning procedure was performed as described above (solution panning).</p><p id="p-0442" num="0398">For selected subcodes, the 2<sup>nd </sup>round panning output of a conducted H-CDR2 affinity maturation panning was diversified additionally in the L-CDR3. Library generation was exactly done as described above. For the selection of improved binders, the new generated libraries were subjected into two additional rounds of solution panning.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0399">The sequence unique clones that were identified were expressed as IgGs and affinity to human FGFR2 was determined using either SET or Biacore methodologies similar to those described in examples 1 and 2. ore than 80 clones were evaluated from the 3 parental antibodies and affinity improvements of 3-6 fold were obtained for clones derived from the 12433 antibody, 27-fold for 10164 derived clones and 68-fold for 12425 derived antibodies. The highest affinity clone derived from 10164 was designated 20809 and it's affinity for human FGFR2 was determined to be 450 pM. Interestingly, this antibody also bound to human FGFR4 with an affinity estimate of 7.4 nM. The highest affinity antibody derived from 12425 was designated 20811 (Table 1) and it's affinity for human FGFR2 was determined to be 110 pM. The affinity of this antibody to FGFR4 was determined to be 75 pM.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0400">In additional studies, both 20809 and 20811 were directly conjugated to SMCC-DM1 to yield 20809-MCC-DM1 and 20811-MCC-DM1. The ability of these ADCs to inhibit the growth of SNU16 cells is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> (A). The impact of affinity on in vivo antitumor activity was assessed in the FGFR2 amplified SNU16 xenograft model. Female nude mice were implanted subcutaneously with 10&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells in a suspension containing 50% phenol red-free matrigel (BD Biosciences) in Hank's balanced salt solution.

Tumors were calipered twice per week (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> (B)). 10164-MCC-DM1 and its affinity matured variant 20809-MCC-DM1 demonstrated similar activity against the SNU16 xenograft. 12425-MCC-DM1 demonstrated superiority over its affinity matured variant 20811-MCC-DM1 with regards to antitumor activity. These data suggest that affinity maturation did not yield improved activity in vivo as MCC-DM1 ADCs.</p><heading id="h-0089" level="1">Example 22</heading><heading id="h-0090" level="1">Epitope Mapping of FGFR2 and its Antibody Complex by Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDx-MS)</heading><p id="p-0445" num="0401">Deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDx-MS) measures the deuterium uptake on the amide backbone of a protein. These measurements are sensitive to the amide's solvent accessibility and to changes in the hydrogen bonding network of the backbone amides. HDx-MS is often used to compare proteins in two different states, such as apo and ligand-bound, and coupled with rapid digestion with pepsin. In such experiments one can locate regions, typically of 10 to 15 amino acids, that show differential deuterium uptake between two different states. Regions that are protected are either directly involved in ligand binding or allosterically affected by binding of the ligand.</p><p id="p-0446" num="0402">In these experiments, the deuterium uptake of <i>E. coli</i>. derived FGFR2 D2-D3 protein (SEQ ID NO:135, see below) was measured in the absence and presence of three therapeutic antibodies: 12425, 10164, and 12433. Regions in FGFR2 that show a decrease in deuterium uptake upon binding of the antibody are likely to be involved in the epitope; however, due to the nature of the measurement it is also possible to detect changes remote from the direct binding site (allosteric effects). Usually, the regions that have the greatest amount of protection are involved in direct binding although this may not always be the case. In order to delineate direct binding events from allosteric effects orthogonal measurements (e.g. X-ray crystallography, alanine mutagenesis) are required.</p><p id="p-0447" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00020" num="00020"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE&#x2003;17</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>FGFR2&#x2003;D2-D3&#x2003;Construct</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;135</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>LENGTH:&#x2003;237&#x2003;amino&#x2003;acids</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>TYPE:&#x2003;Protein</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>ORGANISM:&#x2003;Human</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>MAEDFVSENSNNKRAPYWTNTEKMEKRLHAVPAANTVKFRCPAGGNPMPTMRWLKNG</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>KEFKQEHRIGGYKVRNQHWSLIMESVVPSDKGNYTCVVENEYGSINHTYHLDVVERSPH</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>RPILQAGLPANASTVVGGDVEFVCKVYSDAQPHIQWIKHVEKNGSKYGPDGLPYLKVLK</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>HSGINSSNAEVLALFNVTEADAGEYICKVSNYIGQANQSAWLTVLPKQQAPGREKEHHH</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>HHH</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0448" num="0403">The epitope mapping experiments described in this example were performed on a Waters HDx-MS platform, which includes a LEAP autosampler, nanoACQUITY UPLC System, and Synapt G2 mass spectrometer. The studies were automated by a LEAP autosampler operated by the LeapShell software, which performed initiation of the deuterium exchange reaction, reaction time control, quench reaction, injection onto the UPLC system and digestion time control. The Leap autosampler was equipped with two temperature controlled stacks maintained at 25&#xb0; C. for HDx reaction and maintained at 2&#xb0; C. for storage of protein and quench solution, respectively. Triplicate control experiments were carried out on antigen at a deuterium exchange time of 25 minutes. HDX was quenched with quenching buffer (6 M urea and 1 M TCEP pH=2.5). After quenching, the antigen was injected into the UPLC system where it is subjected to on-line pepsin digestion at 12&#xb0; C. followed by a rapid 8 min 2 to 35% acetonitrile gradient over a Waters BEH C18 1&#xd7;100 mm column (maintained at 1&#xb0; C.) at a flow rate of 40 &#x3bc;L/min. Triplicate experiments were carried out on antigen-mAb complex just as the control experiments except in these experiments the antigen in incubated for 30 min with the antibody at 25&#xb0; C. prior to deuterium exchange.</p><p id="p-0449" num="0404">The results of these measurements are summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (A) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (B). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (A) the average deuterium uptake for FGFR2 peptides in the absence (control) and presence of mAbs is indicated. In this Figure it is useful to examine two differences: differences between control and mAbs and differences among mAb groups. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (B), the difference in the deuterium uptake between the mAb and control samples is divided by the standard error in the measurement. Differences are considered significant if they are greater than 0.5 Da in absolute scale (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (A)) and if the ratio of the difference divided by the standard error is less than or equal to &#x2212;3.0 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (B)). From this analysis we can rank order regions of the FGFR2 that are protected upon mAb binding into categories of high, medium, and low amounts of protection. FGFR2 regions of high protection are potentially involved in the formation of the epitope with a specific antibody although one cannot rule out other contributions for lesser protected regions.</p><p id="p-0450" num="0405">Upon binding of 10164 to FGFR2 we observe high amounts of protection in the following two regions of FGFR2: 174-189 and 198-216. These regions are located in the D2 domain specifically consisting of &#x3b2;B to N-terminal side of &#x3b2;C and &#x3b2;C&#x2032; loop to the &#x3b2;E (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (C) and (D)). There is one region of low protection found in the regions 222-231. However, this region is protected upon binding of all studied antibodies; this observation suggests that this region undergoes a stabilization of its local hydrogen bonding network that may be non-specific and allosteric in nature. Binding of the antibody 12425 to FGFR2 also cause a high amount of protection in the regions 174-189 and 198-216. In addition, with 12425 family a high amount of protection in the region 160-173 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (A) and (B)) was also observed. These regions comprises a region of FGFR2 that is known to interact with FGF2 and FGF1 from published crystallography data (Plotnikov et al., M. <i>Cell </i>2000, 101, 413-424; Beenken et. al., M. <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>2012, 287, 3067-3078). Protection in this region is unique to the 12425 family of antibodies. Of the antibodies studied, 12433 is unique in that it specifically targets the 111b isoform of FGFR2 through interactions with the D3 domain of FGFR2. For 12433 high amounts of protection (&#x2dc;2 Da) in in the peptide 338-354, and insignificant amounts of protection in a shorter N-terminal fragment from 338-345 were observed. This observation suggests that the portion of the 338-354 peptide that is protected upon 12433 binding is the region 346-354 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (A) and (B)). The region 346 to 354 contains four residues that are specific to Mb isoform relative to the Inc isoform; these residues include: Q348, A349, N350, and Q351. In additional studies, affinity matured versions of 10164 and 12425 (see Example 23 below) were evaluated and were found to be similar to their respective parental antibodies in terms of the protected regions observed.</p><p id="p-0451" num="0406">Additionally, using similar methods deuterium exchange studies examining the protection of FGFR4 in the presence of FGFR2/4 cross-reactive antibody 12425 were performed. Preliminary analysis using an FGFR4D1-D3 construct (SEQ ID NO:124, see below) suggested that binding of MOR12425 does not cause any protection in the D3 region. Protection appears to be limited to regions within the D1 and D2 domains.</p><p id="p-0452" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00021" num="00021"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE&#x2003;18</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>FGFR4&#x2003;D1-D3&#x2003;Construct</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;124</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>LENGTH:&#x2003;371&#x2003;amino&#x2003;acids</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>TYPE:&#x2003;Protein</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>ORGANISM:&#x2003;Human</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>LEASEEVELEPCLAPSLEQQEQELTVALGQPVRLCCGRAERGGHWYKEGSRLAPAGRVR</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>GWRGRLEIASFLPEDAGRYLCLARGSMIVLQNLTLITGDSLTSSNDDEDPKSHRDPSNRHS</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>YPQQAPYWTHPQRMEKKLHAVPAGNTVKFRCPAAGNPTPTIRWLKDGQAFHGENRIGGI</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>RLRHQHWSLVMESVVPSDRGTYTCLVENAVGSIRYNYLLDVLERSPHRPILQAGLPANTT</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>AVVGSDVELLCKVYSDAQPHIQWLKHIVINGSSFGADGFPYVQVLKTADINSSEVEVLYL</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>RNVSAEDAGEYTCLAGNSIGLSYQSAWLTVLPEEDPTWTAAAPEARYTDKLEFRHDSGL</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>NDIFEAQKIEWHE</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0091" level="1">Example 23</heading><heading id="h-0092" level="1">X-Ray Crystallographic Structure Determination of the Human FGFR2/12425 Fab Complex</heading><p id="p-0453" num="0407">The crystal structure of a human FGFR2 ECD fragment (domain 2, or D2, SEQ ID NO: 135, Table 19) bound to Fab fragment of 12425 (Table 19) are determined.

Interestingly, Arg210 has been demonstrated to bind heparin (Pellegrini et al., (2000) Nature 407:1029-1034), which can enhance FGFR2 binding to FGFs and subsequent dimerization and signaling. Meanwhile, Lys176 is also postulated to be in the heparin binding pocket (Pellegrini et al., (2000) Nature 407:1029-1034).</p><p id="p-0467" num="0418">Two models have been reported for how FGFR-FGF-heparin complex dimerizes on the cell surface to activate downstream signaling, namely the 2:2:1 (FGFR:FGF:heparin) model (Pellegrini et al., (2000) Nature 407:1029-1034) and the 2:2:2 model (Schlessinger et al., (2000) Mol.
