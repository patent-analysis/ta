IL-33 is constitutively expressed in the nuclei of epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells, is released during cell destruction following tissue injury caused by infections or physical or chemical stress, and then acts as alarmin. It is also believed that IL-33 expression and secretion are increased by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or the like in some mechanisms. The extracellularly released IL-33 binds to IL-33 receptors expressed on cells, thereby being capable of activating intracellular signal transduction. IL-33 receptors are expressed on various immune cells and epithelial cells, where IL-33-induced intracellular signal transduction occurs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">IL-33 is believed to induce allergic inflammation (for example, asthma, atopic dermatitis, pollinosis, and anaphylactic shock) by inducing production of Th2 cytokines (for example, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-13) from Th2 cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, natural killer T (NKT) cells, and Group 2 innate lymphocytes, among immune cells expressing IL-33 receptors (NPL 1: Tatsukuni Ohno et al., Allergy, 2012, Vol. 67, p. 1203). In mast cells and macrophages among the immune cells expressing IL-33 receptors, stimulation with IL-33 induces production of IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;), which is suggested to be involved in the development of autoantibody-induced arthritis (model of rheumatoid arthritis) (NPL 2: Damo Xu et al., Journal of Immunology, 2010, Vol. 184, p. 2620). IL-33 antagonists are suggested to be effective against acute kidney injury (NPL 3: Ali Akcay et al., Journal of American Society Nephrology, 2011, Vol. 22, p. 2057). Increased IL-33 expression is observed in various human inflammatory diseases (for example, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, systemic sclerosis, fibrosis such as hepatic fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and ankylosing spondylitis), and IL-33 is believed to be involved in the development and maintenance of various diseases (NPL 4: Yasushi Matsuyama et al., Journal of Rheumatology, 2010, Vol. 37, p. 18; NPL 5: David Prefontaine et al., Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 2010, Vol. 125, p. 752; NPL 6: Koichi Yanaba et al., Clinical Rheumatology, 2011, Vol. 30, p. 825; NPL 7: A.

Among the IL-33 agonists and antagonists, antibodies to IL-33 have been attracting attention, in view of their specificity and potency. Several antibodies which have been developed are directed to a murine antibody which fails to specify the epitope for the antibody (PTL 1); an antibody which recognizes a region including the caspase cleavage site of IL-33 residues 155 to 198 of SEQ ID NO:226 in the Sequence Listing) as epitope, based on the findings of the specific caspase cleavage site of IL-33 and the findings that the uncleaved form of IL-33 is the active form (PTL2); and several goat polyclonal antibodies which are commercially available. An article dated Jan. 10, 2014 on the website of AnaptysBio, Inc. reports their successful preparation of ANB020, the candidate for development of anti-IL-33 therapeutic antibody, using their proprietary somatic hypermutation technology (SHM-XEL) platform (NPL 11: Hamza Suria, &#x2018;AnaptysBio announces development of novel anti-IL-33 therapeutic antibody&#x2019;, [on line], 2014, [retrieved on 11 Jan. 2014], Retrieved from Internet:&#x3c;URL: http://www.anaptysbio.com/anti-i1-33/&#x3e;). Murphy et al. disclose that they prepared 20 types of human anti-IL-33 monoclonal antibodies using Veloclmmune mouse, that is, mouse transgenic for variable regions of a human antibody gene (PTL 5), but fail to disclose the epitope for the antibodies. In addition, the amino acid sequences of the framework regions of the 20 types of human anti-IL-33 monoclonal antibodies are different from human germline sequences in two or more amino acid residues. Due to such a difference, administration of these antibodies to human causes immune reaction to them to induce human anti-human immunoglobulin antibody (HAHA), which undesirably reduces the effects of the antibodies and induces inflammation or other side effects.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">PTL 1: WO 2005/079844</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0008">PTL 2: WO 2008/132709</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0009">PTL 3: WO 2011/031600</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0010">PTL 4: WO 2008/144610</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0011">PTL 5: WO 2014/164959</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">NPL 1: Tatsukuni Ohno et al., Allergy, 2012, Vol. 67, p. 120</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0013">NPL 2: Damo Xu et al., Journal of Immunology, 2010, Vol. 184, p. 2620</li>    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0014">NPL 3: Ali Akcay et al., Journal of American Society Nephrology, 2011, Vol. 22, p. 2057</li>    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0015">NPL 4: Yasushi Matsuyama et al., Journal of Rheumatology, 2010, Vol. 37, p. 18</li>    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0016">NPL 5: David Prefontaine et al., Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 2010, Vol. 125, p. 752</li>    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0017">NPL 6: Koichi Yanaba et al., Clinical Rheumatology, 2011, Vol. 30, p. 825</li>    <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0018">NPL 7: A.

The action of the anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibody is closely related to the region of an epitope to which the antibody is to bind. Since IL-33 is extracellularly released during cell destruction, IL-33 is likely to be cleaved by lysosomal proteolytic enzymes, which may produce so-called mature IL-33 and many fragments derived from the mature IL-33 and having the activity of IL-33. If the fragments include an epitope consisting of a continuous amino acid sequence, a monoclonal antibody that is capable of binding to the epitope consisting of a continuous amino acid sequence of IL-33 is more advantageous than a monoclonal antibody that is capable of binding to an epitope consisting of a discontinuous amino acid sequence, because the former is capable of binding firmly to the continuous amino acid sequence of one of the fragments and inhibits the binding between the fragment and IL-33 receptors. However, it has remained difficult to identify such an epitope consisting of a continuous amino acid sequence for production of an anti-IL-33 monoclonal antibody having a desired antagonistic effect.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0024">The anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibody that is capable of binding to an epitope consisting of a continuous amino acid sequence of IL-33 preferably exhibits low antigenicity when it is administered to a human or the like. A human antibody preferably exhibits low antigenicity when it is administered to a human and has framework regions comprising amino acid sequences framework regions from a human germline or amino acid sequences consisting of a combination thereof. However, when the SHM-XEL platform or the like is applied to a human antibody contained in a human antibody gene library, amino acid sequence mutation occurs not only in the complementarity-determining regions but also in the framework regions. Furthermore, if a transgenic mouse induced with a gene of a human antibody is immunized with a human IL-33 protein to prepare a human anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibody, mutation cannot be avoided in the amino acid sequences of the framework regions of the anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibody. Accordingly, it has remained difficult to prepare an isolated anti-IL-33 human monoclonal antibody that includes framework regions comprising amino acid sequences of framework regions from a human germline or amino acid sequences consisting of the combination thereof.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0025">The inventors, who have made extensive studies to solve the problems, found that an antibody that is capable of firmly binding to the epitope traditionally believed as preferred epitope, i.e. epitope present in a sequence spanning positions 155 to 198 of IL-33, has little antagonistic effect and that an epitope consisting of a continuous amino acid sequence present in a sequence spanning positions 101 to 154 or 199 to 270 of IL-33, in particular positions 111 to 130, 131 to 150, 231 to 250, or 251 to 270, is significant in view of the antagonistic effect of an antibody that is capable of binding to the epitope, and arrived at the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0026">The inventors have also isolated a human anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibody from a human antibody library, and have introduced mutations only in its complementarity-determining regions to identify the complementarity-determining regions that achieve excellent binding ability and physical properties. As a result, the inventors have successfully obtained a human antibody that has framework regions consisting of amino acid sequences without any mutation as compared to the amino acid sequences of the framework regions of the germline and is capable of binding to human IL-33 to neutralize its functions.

Antibodies can exert a prolonged IL-33 neutralizing effect in vivo, unless they are inhibited by HAHA. In addition, antibodies are safely used, unless inflammation is caused by binding with HAHA. The monoclonal antibody of the present invention is capable of binding to human IL-33 to neutralize its functions, and thus is applicable to novel pharmaceuticals for diagnosis, prevention, treatment, or alleviation of diseases associated with IL-33.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0012" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0070" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows each domain and cleavage site of the IL-33 protein.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a binding activity of each of antibodies to a human IL-33 protein (residues 112 to 270) and each partial peptide fragments thereof (PEP11 to PEP26).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows conformational model of a complex of mature human IL-33 (residues 117 to 270) (shown as &#x201c;S117-T270&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and human ST2 (hST2).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a part of the conformational model in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrating human ST2 and a partial conformation of PEP12 epitope of human IL-33 (corresponding to positions 117 to 130 of SEQ ID NO:226 in the Sequence Listing and is represented by &#x201c;5117-N130&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>; hereinafter, other epitopes are represented in the same way).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a part of the conformational model in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrating only PEP 14 epitope of human IL-33 and human ST2.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a part of the conformational model in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrating only PEP24 epitope of human IL-33, d and human ST2.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a part of the conformational model in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrating only PEP26 epitope of human IL-33, and human ST2.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows effects of a human anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibody designated A25-3H04 on inflammation induced by intraperitoneal administration of human IL-33, based on inflammatory markers (spleen weight, serum IL-5 concentration, blood eosinophil count, blood basophil count, blood neutrophil count, serum IgA concentration, and serum IgE concentration).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows effects of human anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies designated A10-1C04, A23-1A05, A25-2C02, and A26-1F02 on inflammation induced by intraperitoneal administration of human IL-33, based on inflammatory markers (spleen weight, blood eosinophil count, blood basophil count, blood neutrophil count, serum IgA concentration, and serum IgE concentration).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows variations in plasma concentration of each of the human anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (A23-1A05, A25-3H04, A26-1F02, A10-1C04, and A25-2C02) in mice.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows variations in serum concentration of each of the human anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (A10-1C04 and A23-1A05) in monkeys.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the sequence and position of peptides PEP11 to PEP26.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0013" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0091">The definitions of terms used herein are provided below for better understanding of the invention.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">[Epitope]</heading><p id="p-0083" num="0092">As used herein, the term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; refers to the part of an antigen recognized by an antibody.

Human IL-33 consists of 270 amino acids as shown in SEQ ID NO:226 in the Sequence Listing. IL-33 comprises an N-terminal chromatin-binding domain, a C-terminal IL-1-like cytokine domain having 12 &#x3b2;-strands and having a molecular weight of 18 kDa, cathepsin G cleavage sites located at positions 95 and 109, an elastase cleavage site located at position 99, and a caspase cleavage site located at position 178 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). It is believed that, during cell necrosis, IL-33 is cleaved by enzymes, such as elastase, cathepsin G and proteinase 3, which are derived from loysosome etc., into various fragments including mature IL-33, such as IL-33 (residues 95 to 270) (&#x201c;IL-33 (residues 95 to 270)&#x201d; represents the IL-33 fragment represented by the amino acid sequence at positions 95 to 270 from N-terminus of SEQ ID NO:226 in the Sequence Listing; other fragments are represented in the same way), IL-33 (residues 99 to 270), IL-33 (resides 109 to 270), and IL-33 (residues 112 to 270)), and functions as a cytokine. In the case of apoptotic cell death, IL-33 is cleaved at position 178, by caspase activated during the apoptosis, into inactivated forms of IL-33, such as IL-33 (residues 179 to 270).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0106">Once IL-33 is extracellularly released as a cytokine, it binds to IL-33 receptors and functions as an inducer of intracellular signal transduction in the cells expressing the IL-33 receptor. The IL-33-induced signal transduction occurs through pathways including, but not limited to, NF-&#x3ba;B and MAPKKs pathways, and eventually induces production of various cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory mediators. Examples of the IL-33-induced cytokines include TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1&#x3b2;, IFN-&#x3b3;, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-13. In particular, production of IFN-&#x3b3;, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-13 is induced. Examples of the IL-33-induced chemokines include CXCL2, CCL2, CCL3, CCL6, CCL17, and CCL24. Examples of the IL-33-induced inflammatory mediators include PGD2 and LTB4. The IL-33-induced cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory mediators are involved in migration, cytokine production, and degranulation of immune cells, and cause inflammation. In the present invention, IL-33 may be either full-length IL-33 or any active fragment of IL-33, and may also be any derivative or variant thereof, as long as they are capable of binding to an IL-33 receptor described below and attain its effect. IL-33 may be either human IL-33 or IL-33 derived from any other organism. Among IL-33, human IL-33 represented by the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:226 in the Sequence Listing is preferred.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0107">The IL-33 receptor to which IL-33 binds is a heterodimeric complex composed of ST2 and IL-1RAcP (IL-1 receptor accessory protein). The IL-33 receptor contains the binding site that specifically recognizes IL-33 in the extracellular domain of ST2. The IL-33 receptor is expressed in cells including, but not limited to, various immune cells (such as Th2 cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, NKT cells, Group 2 innate lymphocytes (natural helper cells), nuocytes, and Ih2 (innate helper type 2) cells) and epithelial cells.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0000">[Diseases Associated with IL-33]</p><p id="p-0100" num="0108">As used herein, the term &#x201c;disease associated with IL-33&#x201d; refers to diseases caused by excessive extracellular release of IL-33.

Accordingly, the term &#x201c;amino acid sequence(s) of framework region(s) from germline&#x201d; refers to amino acid sequence(s) without any mutation as compared to the amino acid sequence(s) of the framework region(s) of immunoglobulin. The term &#x201c;a combination of amino acid sequences of framework regions from germlines&#x201d; indicates that one or more of the four framework regions have an amino acid sequence of framework region from different germline.

The following embodiments is illustrative, and should not be construed to limit the present invention.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0119">The present invention relates to a monoclonal antibody that is capable of binding to an epitope of IL-33. Since the monoclonal antibody that is capable of binding to the epitope can neutralize the activity of human IL-33, the epitope preferably has an amino acid sequence of positions 101 to 154 or 199 to 270, more preferably 111 to 130 (PEP12), 131 to 150 (PEP14), 231 to 250 (PEP24), or 251 to 270 (PEP26), of SEQ ID NO:226 in the Sequence Listing. IL-33 is often cleaved during extracellular release. If an epitope is formed from amino acid residues being separate on on the primary sequence of IL-33 based on protein folding, cleavage of IL-33 affects the protein folding and deletes the separated amino acid residues of the epitope, which may result in significant decrease of the affinity of the antibody with the resulting fragments. For this reason, the epitope to which the anti-IL-33 monoclonal antibody binds is preferably a continuous amino acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0120">In order to attain the neutralizing effect of the monoclonal antibody that is capable of binding to an epitope, it is required, for example, to inhibit binding of IL-33 with IL-33 receptors. Thus, the epitope in the present invention is preferably present not only on the surface of the IL-33 protein but also in close proximity to the IL-33 receptors. The inventors have performed conformational modeling based on the crystallographic structure data in NPL 11, to identify the amino acids containing the atom of IL-33 located at the atomic distance of 5 &#x212b; or less from a component atom of the IL-33 receptor, when the two atoms are in the closest proximity (i.e. interfacial atom), as described below in the Examples. Examples of the amino acid containing the interfacial atom include P118 (&#x201c;P118&#x201d; represents the proline residue at position 118 of SEQ ID NO:226 in the Sequence Listing; hereinafter, amino acid residues are represented in the same way), 1119, T120, Y122, L123, R124, S125, L126, S127, Y129, and N130 of PEP12; D131, Q132, S133, T135, A137, L138, E139, S142, Y143, E144, 1145, Y146, E148, D149, and L150 of PEP14; D244, N245, and H246 of PEP24; and K266, L267, S268, and E269 of PEP26. A functional epitope to specifically bind to a monoclonal antibody that can neutralize IL-33 preferably includes the amino acid containing the interfacial atom. The neutralizing effect of a monoclonal antibody that is capable of specifically binding to a functional epitope is believed to depend on the number and the conformational position of the interfacial atoms contained in the functional epitope, but it is not intended to be bound by the theory.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0121">A preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed to a monoclonal antibody wherein the epitope consisting of a continuous amino acid sequence included in positions 101 to 154 or 199 to 270 of SEQ ID NO:226 in the Sequence Listing consists of a continuous amino acid sequence of positions 111 to 130 (PEP12), 131 to 150 (PEP14), 231 to 250 (PEP24), or 251 to 270 (PEP26) of SEQ ID NO:226 in the Sequence Listing.

Alignment for the purpose of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved by using various methods within the skill in the art, for example, a publicly available computer software, such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, or Megalign (DNASTAR, Inc.) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithm necessary for achieving maximal alignment on the full-length sequences to be compared. For the purposes described herein, however, percent amino acid sequence identity values are determined by pairwise comparison using the sequence comparison computer program BLAST. In a circumstance where the program BLAST is used for comparison of amino acid sequences, the percent amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to a given amino acid sequence B is calculated as follows:</p><p id="p-0125" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Fraction X/Y&#xd7;100<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0126" num="0000">where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program BLAST in its alignment of the sequences A and B, and Y is the total number of amino acid residues in the sequence B. It will be appreciated that difference in length between the amino acid sequences A and B results in difference in the percent amino acid sequence identity of the sequence A to the sequence B and that of the sequence B to the sequence A. All the percent amino acid sequence identity values described herein are determined based on the BLAST computer program as just described above, unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0132">The epitope found in the present invention is directed to a functional epitope to which an anti-IL-33 neutralizing antibody binds specifically. Thus, a novel antibody having an antagonistic effect against IL-33 can be obtained efficiently by means of the functional epitope of the present invention. Specifically, a monoclonal antibody having the antagonistic effect can be obtained by screening monoclonal antibodies to full-length IL-33 or mature IL-33 to identify those which are capable of binding to the functional epitope of the invention. Accordingly, in a further embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of screening for an antibody having an antagonistic effect using the functional epitope of IL-33. More specifically, if a clone of antibody having an antagonistic effect against IL-33 is concentrated from a naive antibody library by phage display technique, library selection is first performed using a full-length or mature IL-33 protein as bait, the clones of antibodies that bind to one or more of various epitopes on the surface of IL-33 are enriched and then are subjected to the library selection using the functional epitope peptides found in the invention as bait. Such a method provides efficient screening of an antibody capable of specifically binding to the functional epitope and having an antagonistic effect against IL-33.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0133">In the Examples, the inventors tested monoclonal antibodies that had been confirmed to bind to epitopes of 20 amino acid residues in length to analyze their antagonistic activity against IL-33 at different antibody concentrations, to determine epitopes suitable for production or screening of an antibody having the antagonistic effect. The results show that antibodies binding to an epitope selected from the group consisting of positions 111 to 130 (PEP12), 131 to 150 (PEP14), 231 to 250 (PEP24), and 251 to 271 (PEP26) of SEQ ID NO:226 in the Sequence Listing clearly exhibited concentration-dependent increase in their antagonistic effect. The results demonstrate that such epitopes are functional epitopes suitable for production or screening of an antibody having antagonistic effect. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention relates to an epitope comprising a sequence consisting of at least six, preferably at least 10, more preferably at least 15, consecutive amino acids included in a region selected from the group consisting of positions 111 to 130, 131 to 150, 231 to 250, and 251 to 271 of SEQ ID NO:226 in the Sequence Listing.

The monoclonal antibody of the present invention may be an antibody from any animal, for example, mouse antibody, human antibody, rat antibody, rabbit antibody, goat antibody, or camel antibody. The monoclonal antibody of the present invention can be produced by a variety of known processes including, for example, hybridoma, phage display, and genetic engineering techniques.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0136">In the hybridoma technique, an animal, in particular rat or mouse, is immunized with an immunogen, and B cells are collected from its spleen or lymph node and are then fused with immortalized cells, e.g., myeloma cells, to form hybridoma cells. The hybridoma cells are screened to identify the hybridoma that produces an antibody having the desired binding ability, and the desired antibody can be produced with the screened hybridoma. A human antibody can be obtained from a transgenic mouse induced with a gene for the human antibody. The monoclonal antibody of interest is obtained from the hybridoma cells by, for example, culturing the hybridoma cells in accordance with an ordinary method and then collecting the culture supernatant; or administering the hybridoma cells to a mammal which is compatible with the hybridoma cells for proliferation, and then collecting the ascitic fluid. The former method is suitable for production of antibodies at high purity, and the latter method is suitable for large-scale production of antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared by any known technique, for example, in accordance with the description in Current Protocols in Immunology, Wiley and Sons Inc., Chapter 2.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0137">In the phage display technique, phages selected from any phage antibody library are screened using an immunogen of interest to select the phages that have desired binding ability to the immunogen. The sequence contained in the selected phages and corresponding to the antibody is then isolated or determined, and an expression vector including a nucleic acid molecule that encodes a monoclonal antibody is constructed based on the isolated sequence or determined sequence information. The expression vector is then transfected into a cell line and the cell line is cultured to produce the monoclonal antibody. A human antibody with desired binding ability can be produced with a human antibody library as the phage antibody library.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0138">In genetic engineering techniques, a recombinant antibody can be prepared by introducing a mutation in a sequence corresponding to complementarity-determining regions (CDR) or any other sequence within the gene sequence which encodes the antibody, incorporating the resulting sequence into an expression vector, and then transforming the expresion vector into a host cell (see, for example, Borrebaeck C.

A multispecific antibody such as bispecific antibody can be produced by any genetic engineering technique based on antigen-binding regions of two or more monoclonal antibodies. Such genetic engineering techniques have already been established in the art. For example, a desired bispecific antibody can be obtained by linking antigen-binding regions of two different monoclonal antibodies in tandem in accordance with the DVD-Ig method (Wu et al., Nature Biotechnology 25(11), 1290(2007)), or by modifying Fc region of an antibody to combine heavy chains of two different antibodies that are capable of binding to different antigens in accordance with the ART-Ig method (Kitazawa et al., Nature Medicine 18(10), 1570(2012)).</p><p id="p-0138" num="0143">&#x201c;Artificial antibody&#x201d; refers to, for example, protein scaffolds, which do not have a structure of an antibody, but have a function like an antibody.

Such a functionally modified antibody can be prepared, for example, by a method described below. A monoclonal antibody produced in CHO host cells knocked out for the &#x3b1;1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) gene has a decreased fucose content on the sugar chains, resulting in increased cytotoxic function, while an antibody produced in CHO host cells transfected with the FUT 8 gene has low cytotoxic function (WO 2005/035586, WO 2002/31140, and WO 00/61739). The complement activation function of the antibody can be regulated by modification of its Fc region via change in amino acid residues (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,737,056, 7,297,775, and 7,317,091). The half-life in blood of the antibody can be prolonged with an Fc region variant having increased binding ability to FcRn, one of Fc receptors (Shuhei Hashiguchi et al., SEIKAGAKU (The Journal of Biochemistry), 2010, Vol. 82(8), p. 710).

Thus, when the antibody is used as a pharmaceutical, it is unlikely to induce human anti-human immunoglobulin antibody (HAHA), so that it can avoid clearance in vivo.

Examples of the in vitro production system include eukaryotic cells, e.g., animal cells, plant cells, or fungal cells; and prokaryotic cells, e.g., bacterial cells such as <i>Escherichia coli </i>and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>. Examples of the applicable animal cells include mammalian cells, e.g., generally used cells, such as CHO, COS, myeloma, BHK, HeLa, Vero, 293, NSO, Namalwa, and YB2/0 cells; and insect cells and plant cells can also be used. The 293 and CHO cells are preferred.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0199">If the monoclonal antibody is produced in an in vitro production system as described above, the DNA encoding the heavy chain and the DNA encoding the light chain may be incorporated into separate expression vectors to co-transform the host, or may be incorporated together into a single expression vector to transform the host (see WO 94/11523). Examples of the preferred vector applicable to animal cells include, but are not limited to, pConPlus, pcDM8, pcDNA I/Amp, pcDNA3.1, and pREP4.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0200">The antibody thus produced can be purified to homogeneity. The antibodies can be separated and purified by any ordinary method used for separation and purification of proteins. For example, the antibodies can be separated and purified by appropriately selecting or combining methods and instruments including, but not limited to, chromatographic columns for affinity chromatography, filtration, ultrafiltration, salt precipitation, dialysis, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and isoelectric focusing (Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Ed Harlow and David Lane, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1988). Columns used in affinity chromatography include protein A columns and protein G columns. Examples of the protein A column include the Hyper D, POROS, and Sepharose F. F. columns (Amersham Biosciences).</p><p id="p-0197" num="0201">The human anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibody of the present invention can be bound to any antibody that have binding specificity for other antigen than IL-33 to produce a multispecific antibody, such as bispecific antibody. Several chemical methods of producing the bispecific antibody have been already known well (Nisonoff, A. et al., Archives of biochemistry and biophysics., 1961, Vol. 90, p. 460-462, Brennan, M. et al., Science, 1985, Vol. 299, pp. 81-83). In such methods, two different antibodies are each hydrolyzed with an enzyme, and then disulfide bonds in the heavy chains of the antibody are cleaved with a reducing agent, followed by mixing of the two heterologous antibodies and re-oxidization of the mixture. A bivalent antibody is thereby produced. Preparation of antibodies using a crosslinker, such as glutaraldehyde or carbodiimide, has also been recently disclosed (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2-1556). Several genetic engineering techniques for producing multispecific antibodies such as bispecific antibodies have already been established in the art. A desired bispecific antibody can be prepared by linking antigen-binding regions of two different monoclonal antibodies in tandem in accordance with a DVD-Ig method (Wu et al., Nature Biotechnology 25(11), 1290(2007)), or by modifying Fc region of an antibody to combine heavy chains of two different antibodies that are capable of binding to different antigens in accordance with the ART-Ig method (Kitazawa et al., Nature Medicine 18(10), 1570(2012)), for example.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0202">A functionally modified form of the human anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibody of the present invention or a conjugated antibody containing the antibody of the invention can be prepared by a method described below, for example. If the human anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibody of the invention is produced in CHO host cells knocked out for the &#x3b1;1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) gene, the antibody has a decreased fucose content on the sugar chains, resulting in an increased cytotoxic function, while an antibody produced in CHO host cells transfected with the FUT 8 gene has a low cytotoxic function (WO 2005/035586, WO 2002/31140, and WO 00/61739). The complement activation function of the antibody can be regulated by modification of its Fc region via a modification in amino acid residues (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,737,056, 7,297,775, and 7,317,091). The half-life of the antibody in blood can be prolonged with an Fc region variant having increased binding ability to FcRn, one of Fc receptors (Shuhei Hashiguchi et al., SEIKAGAKU (The Journal of Biochemistry), 2010, Vol. 82(8), p. 710). Such functionally-modified antibodies can be produced by genetic engineering techniques.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0203">The human anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibody of the present invention can be bound to other functional molecules to produce a conjugated antibody. For example, if PEG is bound as a functional molecule to an antibody, non-limiting examples of the PEG include PEG with a molecular weight of 2000 to 100000 Da, more preferably 10000 to 50000 Da. The PEG may be either linear or branched. PEG can be bound to an N-terminal amino group of an amino acid in the antibody by using NHS active group. Examples of radioactive materials used as a functional molecule include <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>90</sup>Yr, <sup>64</sup>Cu, <sup>99</sup>Tc, <sup>77</sup>Lu, <sup>211</sup>At and the like. Radioactive materials can be directly bound to the antibody by any method such as chloramine T method. Examples of toxins used as a functional molecule include bacterial toxins (for example, diphtheria toxin), phytotoxins (for example, ricin), low-molecular-weight toxins (for example, geldanamycin), maytansinoid, and calicheamicin. Examples of the low-molecular-weight compound used as a functional molecule include daunomycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, mitomycin, neocarzonostatin, vindesine, and fluorescent dyes such as FITC. Examples of enzymes used as a functional molecule include luciferase (for example, firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase; U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456), malate dehydrogenase, urease, peroxidase (for example, horseradish peroxidase (HRPO)), alkaline phosphatase, &#x3b2;-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidase (for example, glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), heterocyclic oxidase (for example, uricase and xanthine oxidase), lactoperoxidase, and microperoxidase. Examples of the linker used in chemical binding of toxin, low-molecular weight compound or enzyme include divalent radicals (for example, alkylene, arylene, and heteroarylene), linkers represented by &#x2014;(CR<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>O(CR<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>&#x2014; (where R is any substituent group), repeating units of alkoxy (for example, polyethyleneoxy, PEG, and polymethyleneoxy), alkylamino (for example, polyethyleneamino and Jeffamine&#x2122;), and diacid esters and amides (including succinates, succinamides, diglycollates, malonates, and capramides). Several methods for chemical modification to bind the functional molecule have been already established in the art (D. J. King., Applications and Engineering of Monoclonal antibodies., 1998 T. J. International Ltd, Monoclonal Antibody-Based Therapy of Cancer., 1998 Marcel Dekker Inc; Chari et al., Cancer Res., 1992 Vol. 152:127; Liu et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA., 1996 Vol. 93:8681).</p><p id="p-0200" num="0204">The anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibody which competes in binding to IL-33 with a human anti-IL-33 neutralizing monoclonal antibody comprising a combination of specific complementarity-determining regions amino acid sequences (C1, C8, C15, C17, or C18 in Table 1) or a combination of specific variable regions amino acid sequences (V1, V8, V15, V17, or V18 in Table 2) may be an antibody from any animal, for example, mouse antibody, human antibody, rat antibody, rabbit antibody, goat antibody, or camel antibody, and may also be a chimeric antibody or humanized antibody produced by combining such antibodies.

As the artificial antibody, for example, the tenth unit in the human fibronectin type III domain (FNfn10) can be used. An artificial antibody capable of binding to a desired target can be produced by introducing mutation in the BC, DE, and/or FG loops of the unit. Besides the extracellular domain of fibronectin, Kunitz domain of serine protease inhibitor and peptides such as ankyrin and lipocalin can be used as the artificial antibody. These artificial antibodies can be produced by a genetic engineering technique involving introduction of a vector containing a nucleic acid molecule which encodes the peptide into <i>Escherichia coli</i>, yeast, or animal cells, culture of the host cells, and then recovery and purification of the culture supernatant.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0209">The artificial antibody can be selected by searching a random sequence library including random combinations of amino acids for a low-molecular-weight peptide molecules which are capable of binding specifically to the epitope of the present invention, such as an antibody, instead of use of the amino acid sequence of a specific protein or a part thereof as described above (for example, Hipolito et al., Current Opinion in Chemical Biology, 2012 Vol. 16: 196; Yamagishi et al., Chemistry &#x26; Biology, 2011 Vol. 18: 1562).

to an animal to produce a hybridoma from the splenic cells of the immunized animal, and the monoclonal antibody was thereby prepared. The RNA was extracted from the splenic cells of the immunized animal to produce a library of antibodies of the animal. Antibodies capable of binding to the human IL-33 protein were cloned from such a library and the human naive antibody library by phage display technique. Eight anti-IL-33 monoclonal antibodies (Antibodies A to H) were thereby prepared.</p><heading id="h-0040" level="2">[Peptide Array Scanning]</heading><p id="p-0210" num="0213">In order to identify the epitope for the resulting IL-33 antibodies, peptide array scanning was carried out to confirm the binding of each antibody to each of the partial peptides (20 residues in length) of human IL-33. Peptides consisting of 20 amino acids were synthesized, each shifted by 10 amino acids within the sequence spanning valine at N-terminal position 101 (V101) and threonine at N-terminal position 270 (T270) to cover the major part of mature human IL-33 molecules. Sixteen peptides (PEP11 to PEP26) in total were thereby synthesized. The sequence and position of each of these peptides are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0214">Each peptide was N-terminally biotinylated, and was immobilized as ligand onto a NeutrAvidin sensor chip of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system (ProteOn XPR36, available from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). As positive control, the mature human IL-33 (residues 112 to 270) was N-terminally linked with the Avitag sequence, and was biotinylated by biotin ligase reaction specific for the AviTag sequence. The resulting protein (hIL-33) as a ligand was immobilized onto the SPR sensor chip. Each test antibody, the human IL-33 receptor protein (recombinant human ST2 Fc chimera) (ALX-201-367-0050, available from Enzo Life Science, Inc.), or buffer (0.05% Tween20/PBS) alone was then loaded as an analyte onto the sensor chip containing the ligand immobilized thereon (antibody concentration: 10 &#x3bc;g/ml; flow rate: 100 &#x3bc;l/min), to allow them to bind to the ligand.

The Antibodies A and B bound to PEP12, the Antibodies C and D bound to PEP14, the Antibody E bound to both PEP16 and PEP17, the Antibody F bound to PEP24, and the Antibodies G and H bound to PEP26. A commercially available anti-human IL-33 polyclonal antibody (AF3625, available from R&#x26;D Systems, Inc.) bound to most of the 16 human IL-33 peptides studied. The human IL-33 receptor (ST2) bound to the human IL-33 protein, but substantially did not bind to the human IL-33 peptides (PEP11 to PEP26). The experiment failed to identify what portion of the IL-33 was significant for the binding with ST2. No binding with the ligand was observed in the buffer alone or murine IgG (MAB002, available from R&#x26;D Systems, Inc.).

The descending order of the binding ability of the antibody to hIL-33 (residues 112 to 270) was Antibody G, Antibody H, Antibody D, Antibody E, Antibody B, Antibody A, Antibody C, and Antibody F.</p><heading id="h-0041" level="1">Example 2: Evaluation of IL-33 Neutralizing Activity of Anti-IL-33 Monoclonal Antibodies-1</heading><p id="p-0213" num="0216">The Antibodies A, B, E, and F were measured for the IL-33 neutralizing activity, based on the inhibitory effect on the binding between immobilized human ST2 and humanIL-33 as indicator. Recombinant human ST2 Fc chimera (ALX-201-367-0050, available from Enzo Life Science, Inc.) diluted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was dispensed into a 96-well microplate (Nunc&#x2122;, #442404) (1 &#x3bc;g/mL, 50 &#x3bc;L/well), and was left to stand overnight at a temperature of 4&#xb0; C. The following day, the microplate was washed once with 1% BSA-containing PBS (PBS-B), and PBS-B was added to the microplate (250 &#x3bc;L/well) for blocking at a room temperature for two hours. After the blocking, a mixed solution of each test antibody diluted with PBS-B (final concentration: 10 &#x3bc;g/mL) and a recombinant human IL-33 protein (ILC0701, available from ATGen Co.

The difference between the absorbance at wavelength of 450 nm and that at wavelength of 620 nm was measured with a microplate reader (SpectraMax 190, available from Molecular Devices, LLC.). A sample was prepared by replacing the human IL-33 with human IL-1&#x3b2; (PeproTech, 200-01B) (final concentration: 1 &#x3bc;g/mL), and the results observed in this sample was set as background. The inhibitory effect of each antibody on the binding of ST2 and IL-33 (competitive inhibition percentage in IL-33/ST2 binding system) was determined by calculating the percentage of inhibition (%) of binding by each antibody relative to the binding observed in a sample containing the human IL-33 alone (final concentration: 1 &#x3bc;g/mL). According to the results, the Antibody A (epitope: PEP12) exhibited 66% inhibition, the Antibody B (epitope: PEP12) exhibited 55% inhibition, the Antibody E (epitopes: PEP16 and PEP17) exhibited 0% inhibition, and the Antibody F (epitope: PEP24) exhibited 39% inhibition.

The HUVEC cells were inoculated in a 96-well microplate (IWAKI, MT4940-010) (6&#xd7;10<sup>3</sup>/0.1 mL/well), and cell confluence was confirmed. Each anti-IL-33 antibody (final concentration: 10 &#x3bc;g/mL) and recombinant human IL-33 (ILC0701, available from ATGen Co.

After 24 hours, the IL-6 concentration in the medium was measured with a commercially available ELISA kit (EH2IL6, available from Thermo Scientific). After collection of the medium, cell viability was measured with a cell counting kit (345-06463, available from Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.), so as to confirm that the inhibitory effect on IL-6 production was not caused by a decrease in the viable cell count. In order to determine the IL-33 neutralizing activity of each test antibody (inhibition % of IL-6 production in HUVEC system), the percentage of inhibition (%) of IL-6 production relative to the IL-6 production caused by the treatment with recombinant human IL-33 alone was calculated. According to the results, the Antibody A (epitope: PEP12) exhibited 51% inhibition, the Antibody B (epitope: PEP12) exhibited 48% inhibition, the Antibody C (epitope: PEP14) exhibited 33% inhibition, the Antibody D (epitope: PEP14) exhibited 38% inhibition, the Antibody E (epitope: PEP16 to PEP17) exhibited 0% inhibition, the Antibody F (epitope: PEP24) exhibited 38% inhibition, the Antibody G (epitope: PEP26) exhibited 48% inhibition, and the Antibody H (epitope: PEP26) exhibited 56% inhibition.

PTL 2 (WO 2008/132709) discloses three epitopes: epitope 1 (positions 155 to 198), epitope 2 (positions 165 to 188), and epitope 3 (positions 175 to 178). The present experiments revealed that these epitopes had a sequence overlapping with the epitope peptides for the Antibody E (positions 151 to 180) which was confirmed not to have IL-33 neutralizing activity. These results suggest that antibodies to the epitopes disclosed in PTL 2 cannot sufficiently inhibit the binding of IL-33 with ST2, its receptor, and has no or very low IL-33 neutralizing activity.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0219">Theoretically, possible causes for the absence of IL-33 neutralizing activity in the Antibody E would be inferiority of the epitope and insufficiency of affinity. The Antibodies D, G, and H tended to have lower avidity with hIL-33, as compared to the Antibody E, but clearly exhibited IL-33 neutralizing activity. In view of the existence of such clones, it is believed that the absence of the neutralizing activity is probably not caused by insufficiency of affinity. Based on such findings, the four epitopes currently found by the inventors (PEP12, PEP14, PEP24, and PEP26) are believed to be functional epitopes when the purpose is neutralization of IL-33 cytokine, in that the avidity between IL-33 and antibodies for the epitopes is relevant to the IL-33 neutralizing activity of the antibodies, unlike the epitopes disclosed in PTL 2. An antibody that is capable of binding to a functional epitope has high antagonistic effect on IL-33, while an antibody that is capable of binding to a non-functional epitope has a low or no antagonistic effect on IL-33.</p><heading id="h-0043" level="1">Example 4: Mapping of Epitope Peptides to the Conformation of Human IL-33</heading><p id="p-0219" num="0220">In order to identify the interfacial atoms (the atom of IL-33 located at the atomic distance of 5 &#x212b; or less from a component atom of ST2, when the two atoms are in the closest proximity) which would be a preferred epitope for production of an antibody with antagonistic effect, the four epitope peptides were mapped on the conformation of the human IL-33/human ST2 complex. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the human IL-33/human ST2 complex (Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics: PDB ID 4KC3) lacked a partial structure of the IL-33 protein, and thus it was impossible to show the positions of all the epitope peptides identified in the invention. The inventors thus created homology model based on the X-ray crystallographic structure (4KC3) as template (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>; Discovery Studio 3.5 (available from Accelrys) was used), and the epitope peptides (PEP12, PEP14, PEP24, and PEP26) corresponding to the antibodies which exhibited neutralizing activity in the present experiments were mapped on the model (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, human IL-33 and epitope peptides are shown in dark grey, and ST2 bound to the IL-33 or epitope peptides are shown in light grey.

The results demonstrated that these epitope peptides (PEP12, PEP14, PEP24, and PEP26) each have amino acids containing interfacial atoms. Examples of amino acids containing the interfacial atoms include P118, I119, T120, Y122, L123, R124, S125, L126, S127, Y129, and N130 of PEP12; D131, Q132, S133, T135, A137, L138, E139, S142, Y143, E144, I145, Y146, E148, D149, and L150 of PEP14; D244, N245, and H246 of PEP24; and K266, L267, S268, and E269 of PEP26. A preferred epitope to which an antibody with antagonistic effect is to bind specifically is believed to have amino acids containing the interfacial atoms.</p><heading id="h-0044" level="1">Example 5: Preparation of Human Anti-IL-33 Antibodies (Parental Clones)</heading><p id="p-0220" num="0221">Using a human scFv phage display library (n-CoDeR, available from Biolnvent International AB) (Soderlind et al., Nature biotechnology, 2000 Vol. 18(8), p. 852), two different parental clones (scFv) (it indicates that the molecular form is scFv; hereinafter, represented in the same way) were prepared (clones designated A00-0070 and A00-0036), which were capable of binding to mature IL-33 (residues 112 to 270) to inhibit the binding of IL-33 to ST2 and inhibit IL-33 activity, when they were analyzed based on the IL-33-dependent IL-6 production in normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as described below.

As shown in Table 10, the selected clones (Fab) had higher affinity (i.e. low koff value) with the human and cynomolgus monkey IL-33 proteins, as compared to their parental clones (Fab). These clones had no amino acid substitution within the framework regions in the variable regions. Even two variants have an identical single-amino acid substitution in the complementarity-determining regions, the effect of improving affinity is different between a single-amino acid substitution variant and a variant with two or more amino acid substitutions. For such a reason, some amino acid substitutions were frequent in the sequences of the 28 clones for higher-level evaluation, although the enrichment ratio of single-amino acid substitution variants

A00-0070, and A00-0036) were each inserted downstream of a CMV promoter to construct an expression vector for mammalian cells for expression of IgG. The DNA sequences of the light chain of the clones were those shown in SEQ ID NOs:228, 232, 239, 241, 242, 230, and 253, respectively, in the Sequence Listing. The DNA sequences of the heavy chain of the clones were those shown in SEQ ID NOs:254, 261, 262, 264, 265, 276, and 277, respectively, in the Sequence Listing. Each of the expression vectors was transfected into FreeStyle 293-F cells (Life Technologies) using a transfection reagent NeoFection-293-1 (available from Astec Co., Ltd.). After the transfection, the cells were cultured for five days, and then the culture supernatant was collected. Stable cell lines of CHO cells were established with GS system (available from LONZA Group Ltd.) using a pConPlus vector and CHO K1SV cells. The stable cell lines of CHO cells were cultured, starting from a concentration of 0.3&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL using WAVE Bioreactor SYSTEM 20/50 EHT (GE Healthcare), and the culture solution containing secreted IgG was collected. IgG was purified from the culture supernatant by affinity chromatography using AKTA explorer 100 (GE Healthcare) and a Protein A resin (HiTrap MabSelect SuRe, available from GE Healthcare). IgG bound to the protein A resin was eluted with an elution buffer with a pH of 3.2, and then the eluate was immediately neutralized to have an approximately neutral pH, and then was dialyzed with PBS (with a pH of 7.2). IgG after the purification with the protein A column was further purified with CHT (ceramic hydroxyapatite Type I resin, available from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) to increase the purity. IgG bound to CHT was eluted with NaCl concentration gradient. Fractions of interest were collected and then were dialyzed with PBS (with pH of 7.2). The antibodies obtained by this purification process are referred to as &#x201c;neutral-purified antibodies&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0231">Another purification process was also performed, which further involves the step of washing with six-column volume of 100 mM sodium carbonate buffer (with a pH of 11.0) for six minutes prior to the step of elution of IgG from the protein A resin in the purification process described above. The antibodies obtained from this purification process are referred to as &#x201c;alkaline-purified antibodies&#x201d;. Recovery rates of the individual alkaline-purified antibodies after each step are shown in Table 11.

Mixture samples of a test antibody and a human IL-33 protein (ILC0701, available from ATGen Co. Ltd) were prepared. The human IL-33 protein was titrated to a constant concentration of test antibody (final concentration: several tens of pM to several hundreds of pM) over a wide concentration range of the human IL-33 protein (so that it covered the concentrations of the human IL-33 protein resulting from 12-step serial doubling dilutions, i.e. one- to 2048-fold, with the upper limit of final concentration set to several nM to several tens of nM). The mixture samples were incubated at a room temperature until the antigen-antibody reaction reached equilibrium. After the reaction reached equilibrium, the percentage of free anti-IL-33 antibody in each sample was analyzed using KinExA3200. The values of Kd were calculated by fitting the plot of percentages of anti-IL-33 antibody not bound to the human IL-33 protein (vertical axis) and concentrations of antigen (horizontal axis) to a theoretical formula, using a KinExA data analysis program (KinExA Pro Software v3.5.3, available from Sapidyne Instruments, Inc.). Beads for capturing the anti-IL-33 antibody were prepared by suspending 50 mg of Azlactone beads (Sapidyne) in 1 mL of coating solution (10 &#x3bc;g/mL human IL-33 protein (ILC0701, available from ATGen Co. Ltd), 50 mM sodium carbonate at pH of 9.6) and incubating the solution at a room temperature for one hour. The antibody for detection used was anti-human F(ab)&#x2032;2-DyLight649 (Jackson, 309-495-006). As shown in Table 12, the antibodies with modified complementarity-determining regions (A10-1C04, A23-1A05, A25-2C02, A25-3H04, A26-1F02) exhibited affinity with the human IL-33 protein of Kd=231 pM at the lowest (A23-1A05) and Kd=720 fM at the highest (A25-2C02), in the case where they were evaluated in the form of neutral-purified antibodies.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">Each of the alkaline-purified antibodies was analyzed to confirm the affinity with the human IL-33 protein (residues 112 to 270) (ILC0701, available from ATGen Co.

The affinity with the human IL-33 protein (residues 112 to 270) was as follows: A10-1C04 exhibited affinity of Kd=100.3 pM; A23-1A05 exhibited affinity of Kd=195.3 pM; A25-2C02 exhibited affinity of Kd=700 fM; A25-3H04 exhibited affinity of Kd=7.7 pM; and A26-1F02 exhibited affinity of Kd=5.3 pM. The affinity with the full-length human IL-33 protein was as follows: A10-1C04 exhibited Kd=179.8 pM, and A26-1F02 exhibited affinity of Kd=10.4 pM.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">The recombinant protein used as ligand was prepared by the following process. The gene sequence encoding the full-length human IL-33 protein was N-terminally linked with NusA tag-6His tag-TEV Protease cleaving sequence, and the resulting sequence was inserted into pET30a(+) to construct an expression vector to prepare the recombinant protein. <i>Escherichia coli </i>BL21 (DE3) strain including the expression vector was pre-cultured, and the bacterial cells were inoculated into 50 mL of LB medium at a density of OD=0.5, and were cultured with shaking for four hours at a temperature of 37&#xb0; C. After four hours, the culturing temperature was changed to 13&#xb0; C., and the cells were cultured with shaking for 30 minutes. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM, and the cells were further cultured with shaking for 72 hours at a temperature of 13&#xb0; C. The <i>Escherichia coli </i>expressing the full-length IL-33 was thereby obtained. The <i>Escherichia coli </i>expressing the full-length IL-33 was bacteriolyzed with BugBuster Master Mix (Novagen), and then the supernatant fraction was collected by centrifugal separation. The supernatant fraction was then subjected to IMAC purification with HisTrap FF Crude column (GE Healthcare) and then to anion exchange purification with CaptoQ Impress column (GE Healthcare), to increase the protein purity. Each sample after the anion exchange was concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration using VIVASPIN6 (5,000 MWCO). To 1750 &#x3bc;L of the concentrate, 100 &#x3bc;L of Turbo TEV protease (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) and 4.5 &#x3bc;L of 1M DTT were added. The resulting solution was incubated at a temperature of 4&#xb0; C. to cleave the NusTag and HisTag. After the cleavage of the tags, the solution was passed through a Ni Sepharose Excel column (GE Healthcare) in order to remove the NusTag and Turbo TEV protease (fused with HisTag) in the solution, and the flow-through fraction was collected. DTT was added to the flow-through fraction to a final concentration of 3.3 mM, and the resultant was used as the full-length human IL-33 protein in the measurement with KinExA.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00011" num="00011"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="175pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 12</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Purification Method</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="112pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Neutral-Purified</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Antibody</entry><entry>Alkaline-Purified Antibody</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Human IL-33</entry><entry>Human IL-33</entry><entry>Human IL-33</entry></row><row><entry>Ligand</entry><entry>(Residues 112-270)</entry><entry>(Residues 112-270)</entry><entry>(Full-Length)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>A10-1C04</entry><entry>166*&#x2003;&#x2002;&#x2009;</entry><entry>100.3</entry><entry>179.8</entry></row><row><entry>A23-1A05</entry><entry>231&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2009;</entry><entry>195.3</entry><entry>NCW</entry></row><row><entry>A25-3H04</entry><entry>5.38</entry><entry>7.7</entry><entry>NCW</entry></row><row><entry>A25-2C02</entry><entry>0.72</entry><entry>0.7</entry><entry>NCW</entry></row><row><entry>A26-1F02</entry><entry>10.8&#x2003;</entry><entry>5.3</entry><entry>&#x2002;10.4</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="left" id="FOO-00001">*The numerical value in the table means dissociation constant of anti IL-33 monoclonal antibody (IgG) purified by a specific method for each ligand</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0049" level="1">Example 10: Evaluation of In Vitro Neutralizing Activity Against Human IL-33 in HUVEC</heading><p id="p-0237" num="0235">Each test antibody (IgG) was evaluated for in vitro neutralizing activity against human IL-33, based on IL-33-dependent IL-6 production by HUVEC as indicator. A commercially available polyclonal anti-IL-33 antibody (AF3625, available from R&#x26;D Systems, Inc.) was used as a positive control. HUVECs (CLC2517A, available from LONZA Group Ltd.) were suspended in an EGM-2 medium (CLCC-3156 and CLCC-4176, available from LONZA Group Ltd.), and were inoculated in a 96-well microplate (IWAKI) (6&#xd7;10<sup>3</sup>/well), and the cell density was confirmed to be confluent. A mixed solution of each anti-IL-33 antibody (final concentration: 1 &#x3bc;g/mL (about 6.7 nM)) and a recombinant human IL-33 protein (ILC0701, available from ATGen Co.

The medium was then collected, and the IL-6 concentration in the culture supernatant was measured with a commercially available ELISA kit (EH2IL6, available from Thermo Scientific). Cell viability after the collection of the medium was also measured with a cell counting kit (345-06463, available from Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.), to confirm that the inhibitory effect on IL-6 production was not caused by a decrease in the viable cell count. The percentage of inhibition (%) of IL-6 production relative to the IL-6 production caused by the treatment with IL-33 alone was calculated to determine the IL-33 neutralizing activity of each test antibody. In the evaluation of neutral-purified form, A10-1C04 exhibited 67% inhibition, A23-1A05 exhibited 74% inhibition, A25-2C02 exhibited 96% inhibition, A25-3H04 exhibited 97% inhibition, A26-1F02 exhibited 96% inhibition, A00-0070 exhibited 4% inhibition, and A00-0036 exhibited &#x2212;2% inhibition. The results demonstrate that the clones exhibited strong neutralizing activity, while the parental clones exhibited very low neutralizing activity.

To each alkaline-purified antibody with a final concentration of about 1 mg/mL, a hydrogen peroxide solution (final concentration: 1%) was added, and the resulting solution was oxidized at a temperature of 37&#xb0; C. for 24 hours. To the resulting solution, 80 mM methionine solution was then added to stop oxidation. Each test antibody solution was then replaced with PBS with a desalting column, Zebaspin (available from Thermo Scientific). The oxidized test antibodies were each analyzed with a surface plasmon resonance system Biacore T200 (GE Healthcare) to confirm antigen-binding activity, as in Example 21. The ratio of antigen-binding activity of the oxidized antibody to that of untreated test antibody was calculated. The results are as follows: A10-1C04 retained 83% binding activity, A23-1A05 retained 95% binding activity, A25-2C02 retained 100.5% binding activity, A25-3H04 retained 98.7% binding activity, and A26-1F02 retained 89.5% binding activity.

CD4-positive T-cells of human peripheral blood collected from an identical donor were isolated. Subsequently, both cells, that is, the dendritic cells which had taken the test antibody and the CD4-positive T-cells, were co-cultured, to determine the reaction (proliferation) of the CD4-positive T-cells. As a negative control, a buffer (PBS) not containing any test antibody was used in the same reaction of CD4-positive T-cells, and the results were compared to evaluate the immunogenicity potential of each antibody. The results indicate that none of the test antibodies (A10-1C04, A25-2C02, A25-3H04, and A26-1F02) showed immunogenicity potential in the test condition</p><heading id="h-0068" level="1">Example 27: Evaluation of Human Tissue Cross-Reactivity</heading><p id="p-0269" num="0266">Each test antibody (IgG) was evaluated for cross-reactivity to human tissues (frozen specimen of 35 tissues which satisfy the FDA and EMA guidelines, from one donor) by immunohistochemical staining (Covance Laboratories Ltd.). The 35 tissues include adrenal gland, bladder, blood cells, bone marrow, mammary gland, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, colon, endothelial cells (blood vessel), eyeball, oviduct, gastrointestinal tract (including smooth muscle), heart, kidney (glomerulus and renal tubule), liver, lung, lymph node, ovary, pancreas, parathyroid gland, parotid gland, peripheral nerve, pituitary gland, placenta, prostate gland, skin, spinal cord, spleen, striated muscle, testis, thymus, thyroid, tonsil, ureter, and uterus (cervical region and, endometrium). As a result, in the evaluation of alkaline-purified antibodies, all the test antibodies (A10-1C04, A23-1A05, A26-1F02, and A25-2C02) intensively stained vascular endothelial cells (positive control). IL-33 is known to be broadly expressed in the vascular endothelial cells. In various tissues such as epithelium, interstitial cells, neural tissues, muscular tissues, and hemocytes, cross-reactivity to the cytoplasm or nucleus was confirmed, but cross-reactivity to the cytoplasmic membrane was not observed in any tissue. According to the ICH S6(R1) guidelines and other articles (Toxicologic Pathology 2010, 38(7):1138-1166), cross-reactivity to the cytoplasm or nucleus, where an antibody is less likely to reach in vivo, has less toxicological significance.
