Field of the Invention </p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Eph2A T-cell epitopes are provided. The Eph2A T-cell epitopes are useful in methods for diagnosing cancer, for quantifying EphA2-reactive T-cells in a patient and in eliciting an immune response to EphA2 and modulating the immune system to recognize cancerous cells. </p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"> 2. Description of the Related Art </p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The molecular identification of tumor antigens recognized by the immune system has paved the way for the development of new immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer. While many cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-defined tumor-associated epitopes have been applied clinically in cancer vaccinations (Coulie P G, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98: 10290-1295, 2001; Yu J S, et al. Cancer Res 61: 842-847, 2001; Jager E, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97: 12198-12203, 2000; and Nestle F O, et al. Nat Med 4:328-332, 1998.), comparatively few class II-restricted epitopes recognized by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have been identified and clinically-integrated to date (Topalian S L, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91; 9461-9465, 1994; Chaux P, et al. J Exp Med 189; 767-777, 1999; Pieper R, et al. J Exp Med 189; 757-765, 1999; Wang R F, et al. Science 284; 1351-1354, 1999; Topalian S L, et al. J Exp Med 183; 1965-1971, 1996; Jager E, et al. J Exp Med 191; 625-630, 2000; Zarour H M, et al. Cancer Res 60; 4946-4952, 2000; and Zarour H M, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97; 400-405, 2000). Current paradigms suggest that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (at least Th1-type) play critical roles in the optimal induction and maintenance of clinically beneficial tumor immunity (Pardoll D M, et al. Curr Opin Immunol 10; 588-594, 1998 and Toes R E, et al. J Exp Med 189; 753-756, 1999). Hence, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes derived from antigens that are unique to, or that are overexpressed on tumor cells may provide effective vaccine components. </p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"> The Eph family of molecules constitutes the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases in the human genome. Eph kinases include two major classes (EphA and EphB), which are distinguished by their specificities for the ligands ephrin-A and ephrin-B, respectively (Eph Nomenclature Committee. Unified nomenclature for Eph family receptors and their ligands. The ephrins, Cell 90; 403-404, 1997). Largely known for their role in neuronal development, recent reports suggest that Eph receptors play a role in carcinogenesis. For example, EphA2 is overexpressed and functionally altered in a large number of different cancers, where it appears to promote the development of disseminated disease. In normal cells, EphA2 localizes to sites of cell-to-cell contact, where it may play a role as a negative regulator of cell growth. In contrast, EphA2 is frequently overexpressed and often functionally dysregulated in advanced cancers, where it contributes to many different aspects of malignant character. These changes in EphA2 have been observed in a wide array of solid tumors, including melanoma, prostate, breast and lung tumors. The highest degree of EphA2 expression among tumors is most commonly observed in metastatic lesions. </p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"> In the clinical setting, several findings suggest that T cell-mediated immunity provides a safeguard against the development and progression of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and may effectively mediate the regression of established lesions. RCC lesions are typically infiltrated with large numbers of lymphocytes, though the benefits of leukocytic infiltration upon beneficial clinical outcome remain unknown. While this may reflect variance in the functional subsets of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in these infiltrates, data addressing the prognostic benefit of Th1/Tc1-biased immunity versus Th2/Tc2-biased immunity in RCC patients has been equivocal. A better understanding of the constitutive nature and specificity of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in RCC patients will likely provide insights necessary to design, implement and monitor more effective treatment options. </p><heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY </heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"> Provided herein are novel EphA2 T-cell epitopes and uses therefor, including diagnostic and prognostic methods, methods for eliciting an immune response to EphA2 and treatments for cancer. The epitopes are useful in the detection and staging of RCC. It is demonstrated herein that high levels of EphA2 expression are observed in the setting of renal cell carcinoma (method of staging RCC) and that patients with RCC exhibit both CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to novel EphA2-derived epitopes. Moreover, the reactivity of T cells against EphA2 is useful in distinguishing disease status and outcome and the EphA2 T-cell epitopes described herein are useful in eliciting an immune response to EphA2, as a cancer therapy. </p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"> In one embodiment, an EphA2 T-cell epitope is provided comprising an EphA2 T-cell epitope.

The epitopes are compounds containing one or more T-cell epitopes of EphA2 and typically are peptides corresponding to portions of the EphA2 amino acid sequence (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, SEQ ID NO: 2). Also provided are methods for making the epitopes and recombinant systems for production of the epitopes. The EphA2 T-cell epitopes are useful in methods for determining a patient's immune status, or immune reactivity to EphA2 by quantifying the number of EphA2-reactive T-cells in the patient. The epitopes also are useful in modulating a patient's immune responsiveness to EphA2 as a cancer treatment. </p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"> As used herein, the term &#x201c;agonist&#x201d; is a ligand that is capable of combining with (binding) a receptor on a cell and initiating a reaction or activity that mimics the activity of a natural ligand, which, in the context of the present disclosure is native EphA2 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; refers to a physical structure that contains and/or defines an antigenic determinant. &#x201c;Peptide agonists&#x201d; are peptides, peptide derivatives or peptide analogs that mimic a naturally-occurring ligand, which, in the context of the present disclosure, is an EphA2 ligand. </p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"> The term &#x201c;binding reagent&#x201d; and like terms, refers to any compound, composition or molecule capable of specifically or substantially specifically (that is with limited cross-reactivity) binding another compound or molecule, which, in the case of immune-recognition contains an epitope. Typically, the binding reagents are antibodies, preferably monoclonal antibodies, or derivatives or analogs thereof, including without limitation: Fv fragments; single chain Fv (scFv) fragments; FAb&#x2032; fragments; F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragments; humanized antibodies and antibody fragments; camelized antibodies and antibody fragments; and multivalent versions of the foregoing. Multivalent binding reagents also may be used, as appropriate, including without limitation: monospecific or bispecific antibodies, such as disulfide stabilized Fv fragments, scFv tandems ((scFv)<sub>2 </sub>fragments), diabodies, tribodies or tetrabodies, which typically are covalently linked or otherwise stabilized (i.e., leucine zipper or helix stabilized) scFv fragments. &#x201c;Binding reagents&#x201d; also include aptamers, as are described in the art. </p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"> Methods of making antigen-specific binding reagents, including antibodies and their derivatives and analogs and aptamers, are well-known in the art. Polyclonal antibodies can be generated by immunization of an animal. Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared according to standard (hybridoma) methodology. Antibody derivatives and analogs, including humanized antibodies can be prepared recombinantly by isolating a DNA fragment from DNA encoding a monoclonal antibody and subcloning the appropriate V regions into an appropriate expression vector according to standard methods. Phage display and aptamer technology is described in the literature and permit in vitro clonal amplification of antigen-specific binding reagents with very affinity low cross-reactivity. Phage display reagents and systems are available commercially, and include the Recombinant Phage Antibody System (RPAS), commercially available from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. of Piscataway, N.J. and the pSKAN Phagemid Display System, commercially available from MoBiTec, LLC of Marco Island, Fla. Aptamer technology is described for example and without limitation in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,270,163, 5,475096, 5,840867 and 6,544,776. </p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"> A &#x201c;gene&#x201d; is an operative genetic determinant in its broadest sense. A gene includes an &#x201c;expressed sequence&#x201d; that encodes a protein or is transcribed into a functional RNA product, for example an open reading frame (ORF). A typical gene includes an expressed sequence, along with operably linked regulatory sequences, including, but not limited to, promoters, enhancers, transcription factor binding sequences, operators and terminators (for example poly(A) sequences). Promoters can be, for example and without limitation, constitutive or semi-constitutive (for example, CMV and RSV promoters), tissue-specific promoters (for example, a muscle creatinine kinase (MCK) promoter) or induceable (for example and without limitation tetracycline-regulatable systems, such as the BD Tet-On.&#x2122;. and BD Tet-Off.&#x2122;. Gene Expression Systems, commercially available form BD Biosciences Clontech of Palo Alto, Calif.). Two sequences are considered to be &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; if they are arranged in cis to act in an expected manner in relationship to each other. In a gene, regulatory sequences are operably linked in a manner sufficient to cause correct and/or desired transcription of the expressed sequence in a cell. The terms &#x201c;expression&#x201d; or &#x201c;gene expression,&#x201d; and like words and phrases, mean the overall process by which the information encoded in a nucleic acid, typically a gene, is converted into a ribonucleic acid and/or a protein, or a post-translationally modified version thereof, and/or an observable phenotype. </p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"> As used herein, a &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; may be, without limitation, any polynucleotide or polydeoxynucleotide. Without limitation, a nucleic acid may be single-stranded or double stranded. In context of the human EphA2 peptide and nucleotide sequences disclosed herein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, SEQ ID NO: 2 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, SEQ ID NO: 1, respectively), reference is made to conservative derivatives. A &#x201c;conservative derivative&#x201d; is a nucleic acid or a peptide containing conservative substitutions, which include, in the case of a nucleic acid, substitutions with nucleotide bases that account for codon degeneracy, for example and without limitation in reference to the Ala codon, the substitution of GCC or GCG for GCA, or, in the case of both nucleic acids and peptides, that represent conservative amino acid substitutions, including but not limited to the conservative substitution groups: Ser and Thr; Leu, Ile and Val; Glu and Asp; and Gln and Asn. Conservative substitutions also may be determined by other methods, such as, without limitation, those used by the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm, such as a BLOSUM Substitution Scoring Matrix, such as the BLOSUM 62 matrix. Importantly, a conservative derivative substantially retains the function of the native nucleic acid or peptide to which the conservative derivative corresponds. In the context of an EphA2 T-cell epitope, a conservative derivative, as with all &#x201c;derivatives,&#x201d; substantially retains the ability to stimulate an appropriate immune response to EphA2 in the assays described herein. </p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"> The similarity between two nucleic acid or protein sequences may be determined by a variety of methods. For example, the similarities may be determined in silico by an algorithm, for example a BLAST algorithm, which is the reference standard used herein. The similarity between two nucleic acid sequences also may be determined by specific hybridization, which means that a nucleic acid will hybridize specifically in a genome to a reference nucleic acid (namely, the EphA2 sequence provided herein or portions thereof). The hybridization conditions for achieving specificity naturally will differ, depending on such factors including, without limitation, the length of sequence overlap of the respective nucleic acids, its (melting temperature) Tm, the specific genome and the assay conditions. </p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"> &#x201c;Derivatives&#x201d; also include chemically modified nucleic acids or peptides corresponding to portions of the EphA nucleotide or amino acid sequence and conservative derivatives thereof. The nucleic acids or peptides, or conservative derivatives thereof may be derivatized to contain chemical groups that, for example: modify the solubility of the nucleic acid or peptide, for example by the addition of a PEG group; permit affinity purification of the peptide or nucleic acid, for example by the addition of a biotin or poly(his) tag;) or permit detection of the compound, for example by conjugation with a fluorochrome, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, Cy3 or Cy5 or a radionuclide-containing or caging group for in vitro or in vivo detection and location of the nucleic acid, peptide or derivative thereof. These examples of modified nucleic acids and peptides, and used therefor, are only limited examples of the large variety of useful modifications of nucleic acids and peptides that are known in the art. A more complete, but non exhaustive list of such modifications include one or more of N-terminal modifications, C-terminal modifications, internal modifications or non-standard residues for example, and without limitation the following groups and/or residues: a solubilizing group (such as, without limitation a polyethylene glycol (PEG) group), a hydrophobic group, a lipid group, a hydrophilic group, a tag (such as, without limitation: a fluorescent tag (such as fluorescein (e.g., FITC) or a cyanine dye (e.g., Cy3 or Cy5)) or a polypeptide tag (e.g., poly-histidine, for affinity purification, for example)), a transmembrane signal sequence or a portion thereof, an amino acid enantiomer, acetyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, biotin, cinnamoyl, dabcyl, dabsyl, dansyl, dinitrophenyl, cyanine, fluorescein, fmoc, formyl, lissamine, rhodamine, myristoyl, n-methyl, palmitoyl, steroyl, 7-methoxycoumarin acetic acid, biotin, dabcyl, dabsyl, dansyl, disulphide, acetamidomethyl, aminohexanoic acid, aminoisobutyric acid, beta alanine, cyclohexylalanine, d-cyclohexylalanine, e-acetyl lysine, gamma aminobutyric acid, hydroxyproline, nitro-arginine, nitro-phenylalanine, nitro-tyrosine, norleucine, norvaline, octahydroindole carboxylate, ornithine, penicillamine, phenylglycine, phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, L-malonyltyrosine, pyroglutamate, tetrahydroisoquinoline, amide, N-substituted glycines and/or non-amino acyl groups (peptoids), N-acetylglycine. </p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"> &#x201c;Derivatives&#x201d; also include peptide analogs, which are peptides containing one or more modified bases and/or a modified peptide backbone (a typical or normal peptide backbone having the structure: . . . &#x2014;NH&#x2014;CR&#x2014;CO&#x2014;NH&#x2014;CR&#x2014;CO&#x2014;NH&#x2014;CR&#x2014;CO&#x2014; . . . ). Peptide analogs include &#x201c;peptidomimetics&#x201d;, which are compounds containing one or more non-peptidic structural elements that are capable of mimicking or antagonizing the biological action(s) of a natural parent peptide. A peptidomimetic does not have classical peptide characteristics such as enzymatically scissile peptide bonds. A common peptidomimetic is a &#x201c;peptoid&#x201d;, which is a polymer that that includes one or more N-substituted amino acid residues, such as N-substituted glycine.

Those epitopes were identified in silico in the context of the MHC Class II allele HLA-DR&#x3b2;1 *0401 (DR4) or the Class I allele HLA-A0201 (HLA-A2). HLA-DR&#x3b2;1*0401 and HLA-A0201 are two alleles among many. Non-limiting examples of other Class II HLA-DR alleles are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, including HLA-DR1, HLA-DR3, HLA-DR4, HLA-DR7, HLA-DR8, HLA-DR9, HLA-DR11, HLA-DR12, HLA-DR13, HLA-DR14 and HLA-DR15 alleles (www.anthonynolan.org.uk/HIG/lists/class2list.html).

By applying the algorithms described in those references, or other algorithms that search for consensus MHC-II binding sequences (such as the ProPred software/algorithms referenced herein), other EphA2 MHC-II-containing fragments can be identified that are specific to alleles other than HLA-DR&#x3b2;1*0401 or HLA-A0201. Once the consensus MHC II binding sequences are identified, the algorithm described below for use in identifying proteasomal cleavage products, or any like algorithms, can be used to select candidate testing for screening in ELISPOT assays and ELISA assays as described herein, or like assays, for immunostimulatory activity in EphA2-reactive PBLs from a patient with the same MHC haplotype. </p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"> As with the Class II alleles described above, a large number of MHC class I alleles other than HLA-A0201 also have been identified and EphA2 T-cell epitopes specific to those alleles can be determined in a like manner.

For example, Luckey et al., 2001 describes methods for identifying Class I binding sequences&#x2014;briefly by the steps of acid-treating cells to elute Class I molecules, affinity purifying the various alleles, eluting bound peptides form the affinity-purified HLA molecules and sequencing the eluted peptides. Methods for identifying consensus binding sequences for each allele, and the recognition that many alleles can bind the same or very similar peptide sequence repertoirs (HLA supertypes) is discussed in Southwood et al., 1998. Nevertheless, the overall goal is to identify specific EphA2 T-cell epitopes, which can be accomplished by eluting processed EphA2 peptide fragments from any MHC molecule purified from a cell, such as an APC (antigen presenting cell), for any MHC allele, and sequencing the eluted peptides, all according to well-established methods. This completely avoids the in silico step. </p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"> The EphA2 T-cell epitopes described herein, can be used in ELISPOT, or like assays, to screen patients for their immune reactivity to EphA2, and can be used to stimulate a patient's immune response to EphA2. In this manner an immunogenic composition or cocktail can be prepared for a given patient, depending on that patient's HLA-DR haplotype. As also mentioned herein, an immune response to sub-dominant EphA2 T-cell epitopes can be elicited in a patient, which could overwhelm the patient's tolerance to one or more dominant epitopes. </p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"> The EphA2 T-cell epitope compounds are useful in an assay to establish a patient's existing immunity to EphA2. As described herein, a population of a patient's PBLs may be stimulated with a compound containing one or more EphA2 T-cell epitopes, as described herein. The one or more EphA2 T-cell epitopes are selected to match the patient's MHC haplotype. Hence, if the patient has the HLA-DR&#x3b2;1*0701 allele, a compound containing one or more EphA2 HLA-DR&#x3b2;1*0701-binding peptides is selected. Once stimulated with the compound for a sufficient period of time (typically 6 hours to 48 hours), the PBL population is tested for stimulation by the antigen. This testing can be performed by a variety of methods, such as by ELISPOT to determine IFN-&#x3b3; or IL-5 production, or ELISA to determine TGF-&#x3b2; or IL-10 production, purportedly indicative of antigen-specific suppression. </p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"> A number of assays are used to detect antigen-specific immune responses (see, Keilholz, U. et al., &#x201c;Immunologic Monitoring of Cancer Vaccine Therapy: Results of a Workshop Sponsored by the Society for Biological Therapy,&#x201d; J. Immunother., (2002) 25(2):97-138). The ELISPOT assay described herein is quite sensitive and accurate. Other assays that are promising substitutes include, but are not limited to: 1) Cytokine Flow Cytometry (CFC), in which cytokine production is detected intracellularly in a cell population and which only requires about a six hour stimulation period; 2) MHC-peptide tetramer analysis in which isolated MHC-peptide tetramers are used to stimulate an antigen-specific response in PBL and bound cells can be counted by flow cytometry; and 3) Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (QRT-PCR) assays in which the expression of one or more gene target, such as cytokines, can be monitored, permitting rapid quantitation of expression levels from a small sample of cells. Each of these assays are described in further detail in Keilholz et al., 2002 and in the literature. Any of the described assays may be used alone, or in combination with others to determine if a patient's PBL are capable of producing a suitable antigen-specific response. Of note, the compounds containing the EphA2 T-cell epitopes described herein are useful in the ELISPOT, CFC and tetramers assays described above, but not in the QRT-PCR assay, which requires design of suitable PCR primer and probe sets according to established methods. </p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"> Image analysis-assisted cytokine ELISPOT assay is a sensitive method for direct ex vivo monitoring of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The procedure measures both the frequency and cytokine signatures of antigen-specific T cells in freshly isolated cellular material. The assay determines various parameters of T cell immunity such as the clonal size (magnitude) and the Th1/Th2 effector class of the T cell pool. ELISPOT is a superior method through which the actual secretory processes of individual pharmacologically unmanipulated cells can be studied. The technology is non destructive and the lymphocytes can be preserved for further analysis. Under the ELISPOT technique, cytokine release can be detected at the single cell level, allowing for the determination of cytokine-producing cell frequencies. The ELISPOT assay uses plates coated with an antibody, typically an anti-cytokine antibody. In the Examples below, the plates are coated with IL-5 (Th2 cytokine profile) and IFN-&#x3b3; (Th1 cytokine profile). The ELISPOT assay includes the steps of incubating cytokine producing cells, such as PBLs, in the antibody-coated plates in the presence of an antigen. The cells are washed away, leaving just the antibodies, some of which will be bound to its cytokine ligand. A standard &#x201c;sandwich assay&#x201d; is then performed in which tagged or labeled anti-cytokine antibody is bound to the previously bound cytokine and is detected by standard methods, such as by a standard biotin-avidin-HRP (horseradish peroxidase) method. Bound cytokine is therefore represented on the plate as a spot at the site of the complex. The colored spots are then counted and their size analyzed either visually or more commonly by computer analysis, providing data that is then used to calculate the cytokine secretion frequency. </p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"> Both ELISPOT assays and ELISAs are examples of sandwich assays. The term &#x201c;sandwich assay&#x201d; refers to an immunoassay where the antigen is sandwiched between two binding reagents, which are typically antibodies. The first binding reagent/antibody being attached to a surface and the second binding reagent/antibody comprising a detectable group. Examples of detectable groups include, for example and without limitation: fluorochromes, enzymes, epitopes for binding a second binding reagent (for example, when the second binding reagent/antibody is a mouse antibody, which is detected by a fluorescently-labeled anti-mouse antibody), for example an antigen or a member of a binding pair, such as biotin. The surface may be a planar surface, such as in the case of an ELISPOT assay or a typical grid-type array, as described herein, or a non-planar surface, as with coated bead array technologies, where each &#x201c;species&#x201d; of bead is labeled with, for example, a fluorochrome (such as Luminex technology, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,599,331, 6,592,822 and 6,268,222), or a quantum dot (for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,306.610). </p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"> The epitopes described herein are compounds that contain one or more EphA2 T-cell epitopes.

Each sequence is separated from the other by a peptide spacer that may be of any length, but typically ranges from 0 to 10 amino acids in length. In Velders et al. J. Immunol. (2001) 166:5366-5373, an AAY trimer spacer greatly improved the efficacy of an a Human Papilloma Virus (HPV 16) multivalent epitope string vaccine. The peptide can be engineered to ensure that protease cleavage sites are located between the epitope sequences to ensure proper processing of the peptide. This &#x201c;string of beads&#x201d; configuration can contain any number and combination of epitopes. De Groot et al. 2001, Velders et al. 2001 and Ling-Ling et al. J. Virol. (1997) 71:2292-2302 describe peptides having this configuration, methods for making and optimizing such constructs, methods for identifying candidate epitopes and recombinant systems useful in making such vaccines. The benefit of using a &#x201c;string of beads&#x201d; approach is that subdominant epitopes, or multiple copies of the same epitope may be included in a single peptide, thereby eliciting an immune response to an epitope or epitopes to which immunity is not normally elicited in a response to the native (i.e. EphA2) peptide. The concept of eliciting immune responses to such cryptic or subdominant epitopes is called &#x201c;epitope spreading&#x201d; and can lead to a more robust immune response than a typical immune response to native peptides. </p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"> One or more epitopes also may be combined in a chimeric peptide with a second amino acid sequence that has a desired functionality. The functionality can be immunogenic in nature, permitting affinity purification of the peptide. A protease cleavage site can be included between the EphA2 T-cell epitope peptide and the immunogenic portion. The functionality also can facilitate the delivery of the EphA2 T-cell epitope peptide, by including amino acid sequences that facilitate delivery of the peptide. One example of this is to include a portion of lactadherin or other protein to facilitate presentation of the peptide to dendritic cells in membrane vesicles or nanoparticles, such as exosomes. Methods for modifying and expressing chimeric peptides for incorporation into membrane vesicles are described in International Patent Publication No. WO 03/016522. </p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"> The epitope, in any form described above, can be administered by any useful route to vaccinate or otherwise elicit an immune response in a patient. In one embodiment, the epitope is injected into the patient, optionally with an adjuvant, such as Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant, Freund's Complete Adjuvant, or as an exosome, as described above. The epitope can be delivered in a variety of compositions which include the epitope and any desirable, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. &#x201c;Carrier&#x201d; includes as a class, without limitation, any compound or composition useful in facilitating storage, stability, administration and/or delivery of the active ingredients described herein, including, without limitation, suitable vehicles, solvents, diluents, excipients, pH modifiers, buffers, salts, colorants, flavorings, rheology odifiers, lubricants, coatings, fillers, antifoaming agents, erodeable polymers, hydrogels, surfactants, emulsifiers, adjuvants, preservatives, phospholipids, fatty acids, mono-, di- and tri-glycerides and derivatives thereof, waxes, oil and water, as are broadly known in the pharmaceutical arts. So long as the epitope is delivered to lymphoid cells, the route is immaterial. Atypical route of administration is intramuscular injection. The epitope can be administered once or multiple times over a desired time period to elicit a desired immune response. Suitable intervals for administering multiple doses typically range from once a week to once a year, but typically ranges from once every seven to 90 days, and more typically, once every seven to 30 days. Optimal administration intervals may be gauged by a patient's immune response, and the severity of the patient's condition. The amount of the epitope administered also may vary greatly, depending, among other parameters, upon the structure of the epitope, the route of delivery and the patient's health status. In any case, the amount of epitope administered at any given time to elicit an immune response to the epitope is an amount effective to do so. Similarly, the number of times the epitope is administered and the interval for administering multiple doses is a number and interval effective to elicit an immune response to the epitope. </p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"> The epitope also may be delivered to a patient by liposomes. Liposomes can be directed to the site of lymphoid cells, where the liposomes then deliver the selected epitope composition. Liposomes for use are formed from typical vesicle&#x2014;forming lipids, which include neutral and negatively charged phospholipids and a 5-sterol, such as cholesterol. The selection of lipids is generally guided by consideration of, for example, liposome size, acid lability and stability of the liposomes in the bloodstream. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in Szoka et al., Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 9:467 (1980) and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728, 4,837,028 and 5,019,369. </p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"> The epitopes also may be delivered in the presence of heat shock proteins. Heat shock proteins act as molecular chaperones in the cells, ensuring proper folding of nascent peptides into proteins and shuttling new and old proteins inside the cell. Heat shock proteins are believed to play a role in the presentation of peptides on the cell surface to help the immune system recognize diseased cells. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,935,576, 6,007,821 and 6,017,540 describe such uses for heat shock proteins, methods of making heat shock protein complexes and treatment methods. </p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"> An effective immune response also can be elicited by ex vivo methods. in such methods, antigen is presented to PBL populations of antigen presenting cells (often referred to as pulsing APCs), such as dendritic cells, obtained from a patient in vitro, and the immune-stimulated cells are delivered back to the patient. This method ensures that the epitopes are delivered to the APCs and avoids both any potential toxicity to the patient of the peptide and typically requires lesser amounts of epitope. Methods for isolating PBLs, APCs and DCs are well known, and the epitope may be delivered to the APCs in vitro in any form, including by directly depositing the epitope on the cells, or by liposome or exosome delivery, as described herein, alone or in the presence of additional factors, such as heat shock proteins or appropriate cytokines. </p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"> Recent reports suggest that cross-linking of EphA2 on the cell surface of tumor cells by a ligand agonist provokes EphA2 phosphorylation, internalization and degradation (Walker-Daniels et al., Mol. Cancer Res. 1: 79-87, 2002). This triggered degradation of EphA2 protein is believed to result in the acute generation of EphA2 epitope presented by MHC class I and/or class II proteins, making the tumor more easily recognized by EphA2-specific T cells, and potentially resulting in improved clinical eradication of cancer cells in vivo. This supports the concerted use of EphA2-based vaccines to expand and activate effector anti-EphA2 T cells in cancer patients with EphA2-ligand agonists to increase the likelihood for productive recognition of tumor cells by vaccine-induced lymphocytes in combinational immunotherapy approaches. EphA2 ligand agonists could take the form of, but would not be restricted to, anti-EphA2 antibodies, EphrinA1-Ig constructs or synthetic peptides that induce degradation of EphA2 protein in treated tumor cells. </p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"> In one embodiment, a patient is administered an EphA2 ligand or an agonist thereof. The EphA2 ligand or agonist thereof can be a binding reagent, such as an antibody (for example a monoclonal antibody, or a derivative or an analog of an antibody, including without limitation: Fv fragments; single chain Fv (scFv) fragments; FAb&#x2032; fragments; F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragments; camelized antibodies and antibody fragments; multivalent versions of the foregoing; monospecific or bispecific antibodies, such as disulfide stabilized Fv fragments, scFv tandems ((scFv)<sub>2 </sub>fragments), antibody multimers, which typically are covalently linked or otherwise stabilized (for example and without limitation, leucine zipper or helix stabilized); scFv fragments; recombinant antibodies or antibody fragments), or in vitro-generated EphA2-specific compounds, such as aptamers and compounds generated by phage display selection and propagation methods.

Delivery of the EphA2 ligand or agonist thereof is in combination with the delivery of the EphA2 T-cell receptor epitope- containing compounds, and a therapeutic regimen typically, but not necessarily alternates delivery of the EphA2 T-cell receptor epitopes and the EphA2 ligand or agonist thereof. In one embodiment, the EphA2 T-cell receptor epitopes are delivered to a patient either directly by the direct or ex vivo methods described above, and one week later, the EphA2 ligand or agonist thereof is administered. This is repeated any desired and effective number of times, with one treatment per week, alternating between the EphA2 T-cell receptor epitopes and the EphA2 ligand or agonist thereof. </p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"> Any peptide described herein can be manufactured by any of the myriad of known recombinant methods for producing a peptide, or can be synthesized by common protein synthesis methods, such as by solid phase chemistries as are broadly known. In a recombinant method, a gene is prepared that contains an appropriate promoter, terminator and a coding region that encodes the desired peptide. The coding region also can encode signal sequences enabling secretion of the peptide by cells and/or suitable tags, preferably cleavable, that permit affinity purification of the peptide. </p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"> A nucleic acid containing a gene for expressing an EphA2 T-Cell receptor epitope in a human cell also may be delivered directly to a patient, or ex vivo to a patient's cells (for delivery back into the patient) such that the cells of the patient express the epitope, thereby eliciting an immune response. Delivery of a gene, rather than just the epitope can result in a more robust immune response resulting from the extended expression of the gene in the patient's cells. The nucleic acid can be delivered by viral-mediated (such as by a recombinant adenovirus, adeno-associated virus or vaccinia virus) or non-viral-mediated delivery methods (such as by liposome or by direct injection of naked nucleic acid, for instance into muscle). </p><heading level="2" id="h-0006">EXAMPLES </heading><heading level="2" id="h-0007">Example 1 </heading><p id="p-0067" num="0066"> Reactivity of PBLs Against EphA2 T-cell Peptide Epitopes </p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"> Peripheral Blood and Tumor Specimens.

For ELISPOT assays, 96-well multiscreen hemagglutinin antigen plates (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) were coated with 10 &#x3bc;g/ml of antihuman IFN-&#x3b3; mAb (1-D1 K; Mabtech, Stockholm, Sweden) or 5 &#x3bc;g/ml of antihuman IL-5 (Pharmingen-BD, San Diego, Calif.) in PBS (GIBCO/Life Technologies) overnight at 4&#xb0; C. Unbound antibody was removed by four successive washing with PBS. After blocking the plates with RPMI-1640/10% human serum (1 hr at 37&#xb0; C.), 10<sup>5 </sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and T2.DR4 cells (2&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>cells) pulsed with 10 &#x3bc;g/ml synthetic peptides were seeded in triplicates in multi-screen hemagglutinin antigen plates. Control wells contained CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with T2.DR4 cells pulsed with HIV-nef<sub>190-198 </sub>peptide (AFHHVAREL, SEQ ID NO: 3) or Malaria-CS<sub>326-345 </sub>peptide (EYLNKIQNSLSTEWSPCSVT; SEQ ID NO: 4), respectively, or T2.DR4 cells alone. Culture medium was AIM-V (GIBCO/Life Technologies) at a final volume of 200 &#x3bc;l/well. The plates were incubated at 370 C in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 24 hr for IFN-&#x3b3; assessments, and 40 hr for IL-5 assessments. After incubation, the supernatants of the culture wells were harvested for ELISA analyses, and cells were removed by washing with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/T). Captured cytokines were detected at sites of their secretion by incubation for 2 hr with biotinylated mAb anti-human IFN-&#x3b3; (7-B6-1; Mabtec) at 2 &#x3bc;g/ml in PBS/0.5% BSA or biotinylated mAb anti-human IL-5 (Pharmingen) at 2 &#x3bc;g/ml in PBS/0.5% BSA. Plates were washed six times with PBS/T, and avidin-peroxidase complex (diluted 1:100; Vectastain Elite Kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.) was added for 1 hr. Unbound complex was removed by three successive washes with PBS/T, then with three rinses with PBS alone. AEC substrate (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) was added and incubated for 5 min for the IFN-&#x3b3; ELISPOT assay and the TMB substrate for peroxidase (Vector Laboratories) was added and incubated for 10 min for the IL-5 ELISPOT assay. Spots were imaged using the Zeiss Autolmager (and statistical comparison determined using a Student two-tailed T-test analysis). The data are represented as mean IFN-&#x3b3; or IL-5 spots per 100,000 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells analyzed. </p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"> ELISAs. The supernatants harvested from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell ELISPOT plates were analyzed in TGF-&#x3b2; and IL-10 ELISAs. Supernatants were isolated from ELISPOT plates at the endpoint of the culture period and frozen at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. until analysis in specific cytokine ELISAs. Cytokine capture and detection antibodies and recombinant cytokine were purchased from BD-Pharmingen (San Diego, Calif.) and used in ELISA assays per the manufacturer's instructions. The limit of detection for the TGF-&#x3b2; and IL-10 assays was 60 pg/ml and 7 pg/ml, respectively. </p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"> Western blot analysis. Tumor cells (5-10&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>) were analyzed for EphA2 expression via Western blots using the anti-human EphA2 polyclonal antibody (clone: H-77) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif.). Cell pellets were lysed using 200 &#x3bc;l of 1% NP-40 in PBS containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.) for 1 hour on ice. After centrifugation at 13,500&#xd7;g for 30 minutes, the supernatant was mixed 1:1 with SDS-PAGE running buffer and proteins separated on 10% PAGE gels, prior to electro-blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.). Blots were imaged on Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 film (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, Mass.) using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Biorad, Hercules, Calif.) and the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (NEN Life Science Products). </p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"> Immunohistochemistry for EphA2 in RCC tissue. RCC tumor specimens were obtained surgically under an IRB-approved protocol and paraffin-embedded. Five &#x3bc;m sections were de-paraffinized and rehydrated in ddH<sub>2</sub>O and then PBS. Anti-EphA2 mAb (Ab 208; mIgG1) or isotype-matched control mAb was incubated on sections for 1 h at RT. After PBS washing, sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) for 20 min at room temperature, and after washing, were then incubated with avidin-biotin-complex peroxidase (Vectastain ABC kits, Vector Laboratories). After a subsequent wash, reaction products were developed by Nova Red substrate kit (Vector Laboratories), and nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin.

EphA2 was overexpressed in malignant renal epithelial cells. Western blot analyses were used to evaluate EphA2 protein levels in RCC cell lines (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). Metastatic RCC lines tended to express EphA2 more strongly than primary RCC lines, approaching the strong staining previously noted for the prostate carcinoma PC-3 (Walker-Daniels J, et al. Prostate 41; 275-280, 1999). While used as a model for normal proximal kidney endothelial cells, the HK-2 cell line is HPV-16 E6/E7-transformed and expresses levels of EphA2 consistent with that observed for primary RCC lines. Normal PBLs failed to express detectable levels of EphA2 protein. Consistent with these findings, immunohistochemical analyses performed on paraffin-embedded RCC specimens (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) verified strong expression of EphA2. </p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, anti-EphA2 and control anti-&#x3b2;-actin antibodies were used in performing Western Blot analyses of lysates generated from the indicated RCC cell lines, the normal kidney tubular epithelial cell line HK2 and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) (negative control). Primary and metastatic clear cell RCC lines were assessed, as indicated. The PC3 prostate cell line and normal donor PBLs served as positive and negative controls.

To identify potential T cell epitopes, the EphA2 protein sequence was subjected to algorithms designed to identify putative HLA-A2 binding motifs and sites of proteasomal cleavage. Similarly, a neural network algorithm was used to identify EphA2 peptide sequences that would be predicted to bind HLA-DR4 and have the potential to represent CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes (Honeyman M et al., 1998). In aggregate, 8 peptides were synthesized for subsequent analyses: 5 peptides were predicted to serve as CTL epitopes and 3 peptides were predicted to serve as Th epitopes (Table 2). </p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"> Peripheral blood T cells were isolated from normal HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> and/or -DR4<sup>+</sup> donors and stimulated with autologous DCs that had be previously loaded with relevant synthetic peptides.

The IFN-&#x3b3; ELISPOT assay was used to evaluate 8 HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> donor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to the 5 putative CTL epitopes and 7 HLA-DR4<sup>+</sup> donor CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell reactivities against the 3 potential Th epitopes. </p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"> Each peptide was recognized by at least one normal donor (Table 3), and only one (HLA-DR4<sup>+</sup>) donor failed to respond to any of the EphA2 (Th) epitopes.

EphA2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity is inversely proportional to the presence of active disease in these patients and is increased within 6 weeks following therapeutic intervention that results in disease-free status. Interestingly, two HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> patients with Stage IV disease were identified who were long-term survivors (&#x3e;40 months) post-surgery. Both of these individuals displayed elevated peripheral blood frequencies of IFN-&#x3b3;-secreting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells reactive against EphA2-derived epitopes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). Continued maintenance of high anti-EphA2 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity in these patients may relate to their continued survival with active disease. </p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"> Somewhat in contrast with the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell results, it is also shown herein that a fine balance of patient Th1-type versus Th2-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to EphA2 peptides distinguishes between disease-grades. In particular, the most advanced forms of RCC tend to polarize towards Th2- or Tr-type anti-EphA2 responses. This polarization in functional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responsiveness, combined with the potential suppressive activity mediated by T regulatory cells in patients with Stage IV disease, may play facilitating roles in disease progression. </p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"> These findings are unique in part because they indicate that that EphA2 may provide a much-needed target antigen for the design of immunotherapies for renal cell carcinoma. First, EphA2 is over-expressed in a large number of RCC specimens, including 22 of 24 (92%) RCC cell lines and 29 of 30 (97%) RCC biopsy samples, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> and data not shown). These findings are consistent with evidence emerging from studies of other tumor types, which indicates that high levels of EphA2 apply to many cancers, including breast, colon, head and neck (Tatsumi et al., unpublished data), prostate and lung carcinoma, as well as, melanoma. If the present studies can be extended to these other clinical indications, EphA2-specific T cell activity could provide an opportunity for therapeutic intervention for these tumor types as well. </p><p id="p-0097" num="0096"> Interestingly, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell reactivity against EphA2 peptides (as determined in IFN-&#x3b3; ELISPOT assays) differed greatly between RCC patients with active disease and those patients rendered free of disease. Yet, anti-EphA2 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell reactivity did not distinguish RCC disease stage. One potential explanation for this finding is that RCC tumors may suppress the generation, functionality and durability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against EphA2 in situ. This hypothesis is consistent with general tumor-associated immune suppression of peripheral CTL and NK cell activity, as has been previously reported (Kiessling R, et al. Cancer Immunol Immunother 48; 353-362, 1999). Notably, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell reactivity against EphA2-derived CTL epitopes significantly increased in the peripheral blood of three HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> patients with Stage I RCC after surgery that rendered these individuals free of disease. In contrast, in a Stage IV patient, surgical intervention without &#x201c;cure&#x201d; did not change the low frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell reactivity towards EphA2 peptides. These results are consistent with the requirement for RCC tumor clearance in situ (That is, termination of chronic (tumor) antigenic stimulation) to allow for elevation in functional Tc1-like anti-tumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (Liu H, et al. J Immunol 168:3477-3483, 2002 and Moser J M, et al. Viral Immunol 14:199-216, 2001). An alternative explanation is that expansion or maintenance of EphA2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity may require the concerted support of specific Th1-type responses or a shift of existing patient Th2-type or T suppressor-type to Th1-type immunity, particularly in the advanced cancer setting (Tatsumi et al., J. Exp. Med. 2002). </p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"> Th1-type biased CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response could only be observed in a subset of Stage I RCC patients, and Th2- or Tr-type biased CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses were almost always observed in Stage IV RCC patients. It is important to stress that polarization away from Th1-type immunity in patients with advanced stage disease was tumor-specific, since individuals with Stage IV disease responded to influenza- and EBV-derived T helper epitopes in a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; Th1-biased manner (Tatsumi et al., J. Exp. Med. 2002 and data not shown). </p><p id="p-0099" num="0098"> While longitudinal data was available for only one HLA-DR4<sup>+</sup> patient with Stage I disease (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>), Th1-type immunity against at least some EphA2 epitopes was strengthened and EphA2-specific, Th2-type responses lessened after surgical resection of the patient's tumor. These results are consistent with previous reports that in most cancers, the immune response is believed to be suppressed (or deviated) in advanced stage cancer patients. These results also suggest that the nature of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against &#x201c;late-stage&#x201d; EphA2 peptides correlates with RCC disease stage. This finding contrasts with these previous observations for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against the &#x201c;early-stage&#x201d; MAGE-6 epitopes where disease-state, but not disease-stage correlations were noted. </p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"> Th3/Tr CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets may play dominant roles as antigen-specific T &#x201c;suppressor&#x201d; cells, in part due to secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines such as TGF-&#x3b2; and/or IL-10 (Krause I, et al. Crit Rev Immunol 20; 1-16, 2000). Based on detection of TGF-&#x3b2; (but not IL-10) production in 3 of 8 (38%) patients with Stage IV disease, it is possible that the population of human CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> T suppressor cells may hinder the patient's ability to productively eliminate EphA2-overexpressing tumors (Levings M K, et al. J Exp Med. 196; 1335-1346, 2002). These same patients failed to exhibit discernable Th1-type or Th2-type reactivity to EphA2 peptides, supporting the overall suppressive dominance of EphA2-specific T suppressor-type immunity over Th1- or Th2-type responses. These results suggest that Th2- or T suppressor-type responses are prevalent against EphA2 epitopes in advanced Stage RCC patients and likely contribute to the hyporeactivity of tumor-specific cellular immunity noted in these individuals. Future studies could test this hypothesis using flow cytometry analyses to detect HLA-DR4/EphA2 peptide tetramer binding and co-expression of CD25, CTLA-4 or the glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (as markers of T suppressor cells, Levings et al., J Exp Med. 2002). </p><p id="p-0101" num="0100"> Immunotherapies </p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"> A broad array of therapeutic vaccines are currently active or being contemplated for diverse forms of cancer. Constructive immunologic information must be gained from all ongoing trials to provide a basis for an improved design. Hence, there is a great need for the development of innovative methods for the immunological monitoring of clinically-important T cell responses, which could ultimately serve as &#x201c;surrogate&#x201d; endpoints. While no single assay is likely to prove sufficiently comprehensive, it is shown herein that the combination of IFN-&#x3b3; and IL-5 ELISPOT assays and TGF-&#x3b2; ELISAs provides a sensitive means of evaluating functional T cell responses from patients with RCC or melanoma (Tatsumi et al., J. Exp. Med. 2002). These assays are amenable to in vitro detection and frequency determination of both CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for tumor-associated antigens. Using such techniques, our novel EphA2-derived T cell epitopes may prove useful in evaluating tumor-specific immunity in the many different cancer types in which EphA2 overexpression has been documented. </p><p id="p-0103" num="0102"> These same epitopes clearly also have potential to serve as components of a cancer vaccine. Unlike MAGE-6 reactive T cells, which are skewed toward Th2-type responses in early-stage disease (Tatsumi et al., J. Exp. Med. 2002), the imbalance in Th reactivity associated with EphA2 does not appear to occur until later-stage disease. Hence, EphA2-based adjuvant vaccination of Stage I patients could have utility for eliciting protective immunity in patients at high risk for disease recurrence or to prevent prospective metastases. Vaccination with both EphA2-derived CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes may prompt high frequency anti-EphA2 CTL induction that is stabilized by the concurrent activation of specific Th1-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Alternatively under appropriate re-polarizing or activating conditions (Vieira P L, et al. J Immunol 164; 4507-4512, 2000), dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines incorporating EphA2 peptides may allow for previously muted Th1-type immunity to be functionally resurrected in patients with advanced stage disease, yielding potential therapeutic benefit. </p><p id="p-0104" num="0103"> Given its broad range of EphA2 overexpression among advanced-stage tumors of diverse histologies, vaccines based on antigens such as EphA2 have tremendous potential in high-incidence tumor types such as breast, prostate, colon and lung cancer, and in extremely aggressive cancers, such as pancreatic carcinoma (where we have recently observed a 100% incidence of EphA2 overexpression, data not shown). Autologous DC-EphA2 vaccines are currently under development for the treatment of patients with RCC, melanoma, prostate, head and neck or pancreatic cancer. </p><heading level="2" id="h-0008">Example 2 </heading><p id="p-0105" num="0104"> Conditional Triggering of Specific CD8+T-cell Recognition of EphA2 Tumors In Vitro and In Vivo after Treatment with Ligand Agonists </p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"> Cell Lines and Media.

Consequently, the EphA2 in malignant cells generally is not itself tyrosine phosphorylated. Consistent with this, Western Blot analyses verified that the EphA2 in malignant cells (e.g., PC3) is weakly phosphorylated. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, PC3 (2-4&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>) cells were treated at the indicated time points (in min) with either B61.Ig (30 &#x3bc;g/ml) or mAb208 (8 &#x3bc;g/ml). B61.Ig is a fusion protein consisting of the EphA2 binding domain of ephrin-A1 (a major ligand of EphA2) fused to a human Fc domain. Cellular lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and EphA2 protein was immunoprecipitated using the anti-EphA2 antibodies D7 in pull-down assays. Western blot analyses were then performed using anti-EphA2 and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, respectively. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments performed. However, treatment of these cells with reagents that can bind EphA2, even in the absence of stable intercellular contacts (agonistic monoclonal antibodies and artificial ligands), is sufficient to increase EphA2 phosphotyrosine content. Immunoblotting of cell lysates verified that this treatment subsequently induces EphA2 protein degradation. To verify equal loading, the membranes were probed with antibodies specific for &#x3b2;-actin, which did not change in response to EphA2 agonist treatment. The specificity for EphA2 was further verified by showing that the levels of the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase were not altered in response to EphA2-specific reagents.

Data are representative of 3 independent experiments performed. EphA2 degradation was blocked by the treatment with the 26S proteasome inhibitor, MG-132. In contrast, the addition of the endosomal/lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine did not prevent EphA2 degradation, thus indicating that proteasomal and not lysosomal degradation of EphA2 is the major mechanism responsible for EphA2 degradation. </p><p id="p-0119" num="0118"> EphA2 Agonist Treatment Enhances CD8<sup>+</sup> T Cell Recognition of EphA2<sup>+</sup> Tumors in Vitro. Since agonistic antibodies triggered proteasomal degradation of EphA2, it was hypothesized that this could increase presentation of EphA2 peptides on HLA class I complexes. If correct, then it logically would follow that agonism of EphA2 could enhance recognition by EphA2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To address this question, EphA2<sup>+</sup> SLR24 RCC cells were incubated with B61-Ig prior to evaluating their ability to be recognized by the EphA2<sub>883-891 </sub>specific CTL clone 142 (CL.142).

To address this, SLR24 cells were treated with agonistic antibodies and surface levels of HLA class I and CD40 evaluated by flow cytometry. Notably, the staining intensity of both HLA class I and CD40 was not significantly altered following agonism of EphA2 (Table 4).

Animals were then randomized into 4 cohorts (5 animals each) receiving no treatment (control), intratumoral injection of B61-Ig (50 &#x3bc;g) on d18 to trigger EphA2 degradation and proteasomal processing, intravenous (tail-vein) injection of 5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cloned E883 anti-EphA2883-891 CD8+ T cells on d19, or both the B61-Ig (d18) and CD8+ T cell (d19) injections. Animals were evaluated every 3-4 days for tumor size, with tumor-free status noted on day 40 post-tumor inoculation. Arrows indicate treatment days. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</figref>, in repeat experiments, tumors were resected from animals on day 19 (i.e. 24 hours after B61-Ig administration and Western Blots performed to validate EphA2 degradation in situ. </p><p id="p-0123" num="0122"> As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref>, while the administration of either B61-Ig or E883 T cells promoted the delayed growth of SLR24 tumors, no animals were cured by these therapies. In marked contrast, the combinational therapy including B61-Ig delivery (which promoted EphA2 processing in situ, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</figref>) and the adoptive transfer of anti- EphA2 CD8+ T cells, promoted the rapid resolution of disease in 5/5 treated mice. In control cohorts, B61-Ig treatment combined with the adoptive transfer of cloned CD8+ T cells specific for the HLA-A2-presented influenza matrix<sub>58-66 </sub>epitope, provided no enhanced benefit vs. B61-Ig treatment alone (data not shown). </p><p id="p-0124" num="0123"> The major finding of the present study is that the treatment of tumor cells with agonists that promote EphA2 autophosphorylation and proteasomal processing also result in improved recognition by EphA2-specific CD8+ T-cells both in vitro and in vivo. As a consequence, EphA2-reactive CD8+ T cells are rendered more effective in mediating the regression of tumor lesions in situ. </p><p id="p-0125" num="0124"> In normal epithelia, EphA2 localizes to cell-cell boundaries, where it constitutively binds its ligands. Consequently, the EphA2 in non-transformed cells is tyrosine phosphorylated and mediates signals that serve to limit epithelial cell growth. In particular, phosphorylated EphA2 molecules form signaling complexes with adapter proteins that contain SH2 domains (e.g., c-Cbl, SHC, SLAP, and GRB2) alters enzymatic activity of selected downstream effectors (e.g., FAK, SHP-2, PI 3-kinase, LMW-PTP). These signals, in turn, decrease the ability of EphA2<sup>+</sup> epithelial cells to establish or maintain stable contacts with the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). </p><p id="p-0126" num="0125"> The interaction with c-Cbl is particularly relevant to the present findings. c-Cbl contains an ubiquitin-E3 ligase and targets proteins for degradation via the proteasome. The results herein indicate that proteasomal degradation increases T cell recognition of EphA2, presumably by cleaving EphA2 into peptides that are loaded into HLA complexes for subsequent antigen presentation to effector T cells. </p><p id="p-0127" num="0126"> Tumor cells generally have unstable cell-cell contacts, which appears to preclude access of EphA2 to its membrane-anchored ligands. This is consistent with experimental evidence that the EphA2 in tumor cells is overexpressed, but unphosphorylated. Compounding decreased ligand binding, EphA2 molecules expressed by tumor cells serve as substrates for certain oncogenic tyrosine phosphatases, which provide an additional means of decreasing EphA2 phosphotyrosine content. Regardless of the cause, decreased phosphotyrosine content causes the EphA2 in tumor cells to increase their malignant character. In part, the increased invasiveness relates to increased tumor cell interactions with the ECM. These changes are frequently observed in clinical specimens of cancer. Under such conditions, EphA2 ligand agonists can restore a normalized pattern of contact inhibited growth and reduce the invasiveness of EphA2+ tumor cells. </p><p id="p-0128" num="0127"> The ability of agonistic reagents to conditionally and specifically trigger EphA2 degradation provide opportunities for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment patients with EphA2<sup>+</sup> cancers. In particular, these results suggest that clinical impact of endogenous, anti-EphA2 T cell-mediate immunity could be enhanced by combining passive and active EphA2-specific immunotherapies. Previous studies have shown that a subset of T cells isolated from cancer patients can be stimulated following presentation of EphA2 peptides on HLA molecules (Tatsumi, T., Cancer Res. 2003 and Alves, P. M. et al. Cancer Res. 63:8476-8480, 2003). These studies were conducted using ex vivo stimulation of T cells using DC-based vaccination approaches, which could certainly be employed in the clinic. </p><p id="p-0129" num="0128"> Whereas, particular embodiments of the invention have been described above for purposes of description, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that numerous variations of the details may be made without departing from the invention as described in the appended claims. </p><p id="p-0130" num="0129"> All publications, patents and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference into the specification to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated herein by reference. </p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US20060019899A1-20060126-SEQLST.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><us-claim-statement>We claim: </us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
