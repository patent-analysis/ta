The gene for PCSK9 localizes to human chromosome 1p33-p34.3; Seidah et al., supra. PCSK9 is expressed in cells capable of proliferation and differentiation including, for example, hepatocytes, kidney mesenchymal cells, intestinal ileum, and colon epithelia as well as embryonic brain telencephalon neurons; Seidah et al., supra.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Original synthesis of PCSK9 is in the form of an inactive enzyme precursor, or zymogen, of &#x2dc;72-kDa which undergoes autocatalytic, intramolecular processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (&#x201c;ER&#x201d;) to activate its functionality. This internal processing event has been reported to occur at the SSVFAQ&#x2193;SIPWNL<sup>158 </sup>motif (SEQ ID NOs: 19 and 20, respectively); Benjannet et al., 2004 <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>279:48865-48875. Such internal processing has been reported as a requirement of exit from the ER; Benjannet et al., supra; Seidah et al., supra. The cleaved and, thereby, activated protein is secreted in association with the cleaved peptide; supra.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The sequence for human PCSK9 (&#x2dc;22-kb long with 12 exons encoding a 692 amino acid protein) can be found in one instance at Deposit No. NP<sub>&#x2014;</sub>777596.2. Human, mouse and rat PCSK9 nucleic acid sequences have been deposited; see, e.g., GenBank Accession Nos.: AX127530 (also AX207686), NP<sub>&#x2014;</sub>705793 (also Q80W65), and P59996, respectively. PCSK9 possesses several domains found in other proprotein convertases, including an N-terminal signal sequence, a pro domain, a catalytic domain and a cysteine-rich C terminal domain. The PCSK9 catalytic domain shares high sequence similarity with the proteinase K family of subtilases and, notably, a catalytic triad of D186, H226 and S386.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">PCSK9 is disclosed and/or claimed in several patent publications including, but not limited to the following: PCT Publication Nos.

EP 1 440 981, EP 1 067 182, and EP 1 471 152.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">PCSK9 has been ascribed a role in the differentiation of hepatic and neuronal cells (Seidah et al., supra.), is highly expressed in embryonic liver, and has been strongly implicated in cholesterol homeostasis. Studies have suggested a specific role for PCSK9 in cholesterol biosynthesis or uptake. In a study of cholesterol-fed rats, Maxwell et al. found that PCSK9 was downregulated in a similar manner to three other genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, Maxwell et al., 2003 <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:2109-2119. The expression of PCSK9 has, in fact, been shown to be regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (&#x201c;SREBP&#x201d;), as seen with other genes involved in cholesterol metabolism; supra. Later support for these findings came about through a study of PCSK9 transcriptional regulation which demonstrated that such regulation was quite typical of other genes implicated in lipoprotein metabolism; Dubuc et al., 2004 <i>Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. </i>24:1454-1459. Statins have been shown to upregulate PCSK9 expression in a manner attributed to the cholesterol-lowering effects of the drugs; supra. Moreover, it has been shown that PCSK9 promoters possess two conserved sites involved in cholesterol regulation, a sterol regulatory element and an Sp1 site; supra.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Several lines of evidence demonstrate that PCSK9, in particular, lowers the amount of hepatic LDLR protein and thus compromises the liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol from the circulation. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PCSK9 in the livers of mice results in the accumulation of circulating LDL-C due to a dramatic loss of hepatic LDLR protein, with no effect on LDLR mRNA levels; Benjannet et al., 2004 <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>279:48865-48875; Maxwell &#x26; Breslow, 2004 <i>PNAS </i>101:7100-7105; Park et al., 2004 <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>279:50630-50638; and Lalanne et al., 2005 <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>46:1312-1319. The effect of PCSK9 overexpression on raising circulating LDL-C levels in mice is completely dependent on the expression of LDLR, again, indicating that the regulation of LDL-C by PCSK9 is mediated through downregulation of LDLR protein. In agreement with these findings, mice lacking PCSK9 or in which PCSK9 mRNA has been lowered by antisense oligonucleotide inhibitors have higher levels of hepatic LDLR protein and a greater ability to clear circulating LDL-C; Rashid et al., 2005 <i>PNAS </i>102:5374-5379; and Graham et al., 2007 <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>48(4):763-767. In addition, lowering PCSK9 levels in cultured human hepatocytes by siRNA also results in higher LDLR protein levels and an increased ability to take up LDL-C; Benjannet et al., 2004 <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>279:48865-48875; and Lalanne et al., 2005 <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>46:1312-1319. Together, these data indicate that PCSK9 action leads to increased LDL-C by lowering LDLR protein levels.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A number of mutations in the gene PCSK9 have also been conclusively associated with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (&#x201c;ADH&#x201d;), an inherited metabolism disorder characterized by marked elevations of low density lipoprotein (&#x201c;LDL&#x201d;) particles in the plasma which can lead to premature cardiovascular failure; see Abifadel et al., 2003 <i>Nature Genetics </i>34:154-156; Timms et al., 2004 <i>Hum. Genet. </i>114:349-353; Leren, 2004 <i>Clin. Genet. </i>65:419-422. A later-published study on the S127R mutation of Abifadel et al., supra, reported that patients carrying such a mutation exhibited higher total cholesterol and apoB100 in the plasma attributed to (1) an overproduction of apoB100-containing lipoproteins, such as low density lipoprotein (&#x201c;LDL&#x201d;), very low density lipoprotein (&#x201c;VLDL&#x201d;) and intermediate density lipoprotein (&#x201c;IDL&#x201d;), and (2) an associated reduction in clearance or conversion of said lipoproteins; Ouguerram et al., 2004 Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 24:1448-1453.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, there can be no doubt that PCSK9 plays a role in the regulation of LDL. The expression or upregulation of PCSK9 is associated with increased plasma levels of LDL cholesterol, and the corresponding inhibition or lack of expression of PCSK9 is associated with reduced LDL cholesterol plasma levels. Decreased levels of LDL cholesterol associated with sequence variations in PCSK9 have been found to confer protection against coronary heart disease; Cohen, 2006 <i>N. Engl. J. Med. </i>354:1264-1272.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The identification of compounds and/or agents effective in the treatment of cardiovascular affliction is highly desirable. In clinical trials, reductions in LDL cholesterol levels have been directly related to the rate of coronary events; Law et al., 2003 <i>BMJ </i>326:1423-1427. More recently, the moderate lifelong reduction in plasma LDL cholesterol levels was found to correlate with a substantial reduction in the incidence of coronary events; Cohen et al., supra. This was the case even in populations with a high prevalence of non-lipid-related cardiovascular risk factors; supra. Accordingly, there is great benefit to be reaped from the managed control of LDL cholesterol levels.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention advances these interests by providing antagonists of PCSK9 of use for inhibiting the activities of PCSK9 and the corresponding role PCSK9 plays in various therapeutic conditions.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention relates to antagonists of PCSK9 and, in particular embodiments, those antagonists that inhibit both human and murine PCSK9 and those exhibiting preferential targeting of processed PCSK9. Broadly, protein-specific antagonists of PCSK9 (or &#x201c;PCSK9-specific antagonists&#x201d; as referred to herein) are PCSK9 protein binding molecules or molecules effective in the selective binding of PCSK9 and inhibition of PCSK9 function. These molecules are of import in the treatment of conditions associated with or impacted by PCSK9 function, including, but not limited to hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome and related conditions. PCSK9-specific antagonists are characterized by selective recognition and binding to PCSK9. PCSK9-specific antagonists do not show significant binding to proteins other than PCSK9, other than in those specific instances where the antagonist is supplemented or designed to confer an additional, distinct specificity to the PCSK9-specific binding component.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">PCSK9-specific antagonists forming particular embodiments hereof comprise (a) a heavy chain variable region comprising a CDR3 domain comprising SEQ ID NO: 17 or an equivalent of SEQ ID NO: 17, said equivalent characterized as having one or more conservative amino acid substitutions in the CDR3 domain; and/or (b) a light chain variable region comprising a CDR3 domain comprising SEQ ID NO: 7 or an equivalent of SEQ ID NO: 7, said equivalent characterized as having one or more conservative amino acid substitutions in the CDR3 domain. In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K<sub>D </sub>of 1.2&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M or less. In more specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K<sub>D </sub>of 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M or less. In additional embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K<sub>D </sub>of 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M or less. In further embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K<sub>D </sub>of 5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>M or less, or of 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>M or less. In select embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K<sub>D </sub>of 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M or less, a K<sub>D </sub>of 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;11 </sup>M or less, or a K<sub>D </sub>of 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>M or less. In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists do not bind proteins other than PCSK9 at the above levels indicated for binding to PCSK9.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Particular embodiments of the present invention include PCSK9-specific antagonists which exhibit binding to PCSK9 at one of the above prescribed levels and compete for binding to PCSK9 with 1D05 antibody molecules. 1D05 antibody molecules form important PCSK9-specific antagonists hereof. 1D05 antibody molecules are characterized as comprising a (i) heavy chain variable region (&#x201c;VH&#x201d;) comprising SEQ ID NO: 11; and (ii) a light chain variable region (&#x201c;VL&#x201d;) comprising SEQ ID NO: 27. Said VH and VL regions comprise the full complement of disclosed CDRs 1, 2 and 3 for the VH (SEQ ID NOs: 13, 15 and 17) and VL regions (SEQ ID NOs: 3, 5 and 7), respectively. Examples of 1D05 antibody molecules include without limitation: (i) a Fab which comprises a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 1 and an Fd chain comprising amino acids 1-233 of SEQ ID NO: 9 (or SEQ ID NO: 9); and (ii) a full length antibody molecule which comprises a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 26 and a heavy chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 25.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">PCSK9-specific antagonists are effective in counteracting PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL-uptake, and particularly human and/or murine PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake. Repeatedly, PCSK9-specific antagonist 1D05 has demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of the effects of PCSK9 on LDL uptake. Accordingly, the disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists are of import for lowering plasma LDL cholesterol levels. The disclosed antagonists also have utility for various diagnostic purposes, including the detection and quantification of PCSK9. Select 1D05 antagonists are, in particular, useful because of their cross-reactivity with both human and murine PCSK9. This quality enables particular 1D05 antagonists to be studied pharmacologically in murine models without having to ensure that the mice express human PCSK9. In such experiments, the murine model is sufficiently representative of the native activity of the targeted protein and the antagonist's inhibition thereof.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In specific embodiments, the present invention encompasses PCSK9-specific antagonists. In particular embodiments, the present invention encompasses antibody molecules comprising disclosed heavy and/or light chain variable regions, equivalents of said regions having one or more conservative amino acid substitutions, and homologs thereof. Select embodiments comprise isolated PCSK9-specific antagonists that comprise the disclosed CDR domains or sets of the heavy and/or light chain CDR domains, and equivalents of such domains characterized as having one or more conservative amino acid substitutions. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, fragments of PCSK9-specific antagonists that retain the ability to antagonize PCSK9 may be inserted into various frameworks; see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,818,418 and references contained therein, the collective disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, which discuss various scaffolds which may be used to display antibody loops previously selected on the basis of antigen binding.

Protein-specific antagonists of PCSK9 (or &#x201c;PCSK9-specific antagonists&#x201d;) in accordance herewith are effective in the selective binding to and inhibition of PCSK9 function and, thus, are of import in the treatment of conditions associated with or impacted by PCSK9 function, including, but not limited to, hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome and related conditions. Use of the term &#x201c;antagonist&#x201d; refers to the fact that the subject molecule can antagonize the functioning of PCSK9. Use of the term &#x201c;antagonizing&#x201d; or derivatives thereof refers to the act of opposing, counteracting, inhibiting, neutralizing or curtailing one or more functions of PCSK9. Reference herein to PCSK9 function or PCSK9 activity refers to any function or activity that is driven by, requires, or is exacerbated or enhanced by PCSK9. PCSK9-specific antagonists as described herein have proven to be effective for counteracting human and/or murine PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL-uptake.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">One important embodiment hereof relates to 1D05 antibody molecules. Such 1D05 antibody molecules are characterized as comprising a (i) heavy chain variable region (&#x201c;VH&#x201d;) comprising SEQ ID NO: 11; and (ii) a light chain variable region (&#x201c;VL&#x201d;) comprising SEQ ID NO: 27. Said VH and VL regions comprise the full complement of disclosed CDRs 1, 2 and 3 for the VH (SEQ ID NOs: 13, 15 and 17) and VL regions (SEQ ID NOs: 3, 5 and 7), respectively. Examples of 1D05 antibody molecules include without limitation: (i) a Fab which comprises a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 1 and an Fd chain comprising amino acids 1-233 of SEQ ID NO: 9 (or SEQ ID NO: 9); and (ii) a full length antibody molecule which comprises a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 26 and a heavy chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 25. The se lect group of 1D05 antibodies demonstrate that PCSK9-specific antagonists as disclosed herein effectively inhibit both human and murine PCSK9 and may be studied pharmacologically in murine models absent the expression of human PCSK9.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The CDR definitions arrived at and disclosed herein were defined using the Morphosys software program Sequence Analysis Software (&#x201c;SAS&#x201d;). Applicants wish to note, however, that various other methods are available to delineate and define the start and end points of the CDR sequences, including but not limited to Kabat, 1991 <i>Sequences of proteins of Immunological Interest, </i>5<sup>th </sup>edit., NIH Publication no. 91-3242 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Clothia et al., 1987 <i>J.

These and other methods have been reviewed and are well within the realm of skills possessed by those in the art; see, e.g., Honegger &#x26; Pl&#xfc;ckthun, 2001 <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>309:657-670. While the current inventors have employed the SAS software to define the CDRs, the present invention fully encompasses the different definitions around the sequences and the varying CDR delineations arrived at through use of any different analysis software or methods. Said use and resulting CDR definitions based on the presently disclosed sequences is fully within the scope of the present disclosure and anticipated herein.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">PCSK9-specific molecules also have utility for various diagnostic purposes in the detection and quantification of PCSK9.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists are, furthermore, unique in that select embodiments have demonstrated a preferential recognition of processed PCSK9, the active form of PCSK9.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">PCSK9-specific antagonists as disclosed herein are desirable molecules for lowering plasma LDL cholesterol levels and are of utility for any primate, mammal or vertebrate of commercial or domestic veterinary importance. PCSK9-specific antagonists are of utility as well to inhibit the activity of PCSK9 in any population of cells or tissues possessing the LDL receptor. The utility of the disclosed antagonists is directly measurable by assays readily available to the skilled artisan. Means for measuring LDL uptake are described in the literature; see, e.g., Barak &#x26; Webb, 1981 <i>J. Cell Biol. </i>90:595-604, and Stephan &#x26; Yurachek, 1993 <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>34:325330. In addition, means for measuring LDL cholesterol in plasma is well described in the literature; see, e.g., McNamara et al., 2006 <i>Clinica Chimica Acta </i>369:158-167. The particular impact of the disclosed antagonists on cellular LDL uptake may also be measured through a method which comprises providing purified PCSK9 and labeled LDL particles to a cell sample; providing a PCSK9 antagonist to the cell sample; incubating said cell sample for a period of time sufficient to allow LDL particle uptake by the cells; quantifying the amount of label incorporated into the cell; and identifying those antagonists that result in an increase in the amount of quantified label taken up by the cells as compared with that observed when PCSK9 is administered alone. An additional method for measuring the impact of the disclosed antagonists comprises providing purified PCSK9 and labeled LDL particles to a cell sample; providing a PCSK9 antagonist to the cell sample; incubating said cell sample for a period of time sufficient to allow LDL particle uptake by the cells; isolating cells of the cell sample by removing the supernate; reducing non-specific association of labeled LDL particles (whether to the plate, the cells, or anything other than the LDL receptor); lysing the cells; quantifying the amount of label retained within the cell lysate; and identifying those antagonists that result in an increase in the amount of quantified label taken up by the cells as compared with that observed when PCSK9 is administered alone. Antagonists that result in an increase in the amount of quantified label are PCSK9 antagonists.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Any type of cell bearing the LDL receptor can be employed in the above methods including, but not limited to HEK cells, HepG2 cells, and CHO cells. LDL particles derived from any source are of use in the above-described assays. In particular assays, the LDL particles are fresh particles derived from blood. This can be accomplished by any method available to the skilled artisan including, but not limited to, the method of Havel et al., 1955 <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>34: 1345-1353. The LDL particles may be labeled with fluorescence. The labeled LDL particles may have incorporated therein visible wavelength excited fluorophore 3,3&#x2032;-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine iodide (dil(3)) to form the highly fluorescent LDL derivative dil(3)-LDL. Any label which enables the skilled artisan to detect LDL in the cellular lysate may be used. An LDL analog may be used that would only become detectable (e.g., become fluorescent or fluoresce at a different wavelength, etc.) when metabolized intracellularly or, for instance, if it were to become associated with (or dissociated from) other molecules in the process of becoming internalized (e.g. a FRET assay, in which an LDL analog would become associated with a secondary fluor, or else be dissociated from a quencher). Any means available in the art for detecting internalization of labeled LDL particles can be employed. The incubation time for the LDL particles and PCSK9 with the cells is an amount of time sufficient to allow LDL particle uptake by the cells. This time may be within the range of 5 minutes to 360 minutes. The concentration of PCSK9 added to the cells may be in the range of 1 nM to 5 &#x3bc;M and, in specific methods, be in the range of 0.1 nM to 3 &#x3bc;M. One specific means by which the skilled artisan can determine a range of concentrations for a particular PCSK9 protein is to develop a dose response curve in the LDL-uptake assay. A concentration of PCSK9 can be selected that promotes close to maximal loss of LDL-uptake and is still in the linear range of the dose response curve. Typically, this concentration is &#x2dc;5 times the EC-50 of the protein extracted from the dose response curve. The concentrations can vary by protein.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Broadly, PCSK9-specific antagonists as defined herein selectively recognize and specifically bind to PCSK9. An antibody is typically said to specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation constant is &#x2266;1 &#x3bc;M, preferably &#x2266;100 nM and most preferably &#x2266;10 nM. Use of the terms &#x201c;selective&#x201d; or &#x201c;specific&#x201d; herein, further, refers to the fact that the disclosed antagonists do not show significant binding to proteins other than PSCK9, except in those specific instances where the antagonist is supplemented or designed to confer an additional, distinct specificity to the PCSK9-specific binding portion (as, for example, in bispecific or bifunctional molecules where the molecule is designed to bind two molecules or effect two functions, at least one of which is to specifically bind PCSK9). In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K<sub>D </sub>of 1.2&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M or less.

In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists do not bind proteins other than PCSK9 at the above K<sub>D</sub>s. K<sub>D </sub>refers to the dissociation constant obtained from the ratio of K<sub>d </sub>(the dissociation rate of a particular binding molecule-target protein interaction) to K<sub>a </sub>(the association rate of the particular binding molecule-target protein interaction), or K<sub>d</sub>/K<sub>a </sub>which is expressed as a molar concentration (M). K<sub>D </sub>values can be determined using methods well established in the art. A preferred method for determining the K<sub>D </sub>of a binding molecule is by using surface plasmon resonance, for example employing a biosensor system such as a Biacore&#x2122; (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) system.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">PCSK9-specific antagonists disclosed herein have been shown to dose-dependently inhibit human and/or murine PCSK9 dependent effects on LDL uptake.

The limited proteolysis mass spectrometry analysis involved incubating wild-type PCSK9 (&#x201c;wt-PCSK9&#x201d;) and a complex of wt-PCSK9 and 1D05 with endoproteinase enzymes of different specificity in carefully controlled conditions. Under such conditions, the endoproteases cleaved only exposed primary cleavage sites. The experiment was designed so that the binding of 1D05 to wt-hPCSK9 masked surface residues normally exposed on wt-hPCSK9 not bound to the antibody. Such masked residues provided insight into the binding domain of 1D05. Through such experiments, a novel neutralizing epitope conformational in nature and represented by peptides RYRAD (SEQ ID NO: 42) AND REIEGR (SEQ ID NO: 37) was identified. This epitope falls within PCSK9's catalytic domain and provides a novel target epitope for which to identify additional effective PCSK9 antagonists. Identification of additional PCSK9-specific antagonists binding this epitope is of significant interest given 1D05's PCSK9-neutralizing activity.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">One means of identifying antagonists and particularly antibodies that bind to the identified 1D05 epitope or an overlapping epitope is through a competition or similar assay where the candidate antibody or binding molecule would have to out-compete 1D05 for the epitope. Competitive antagonists encompassed herein are molecules that inhibit (i.e., prevent or interfere with in comparison to a control) or reduce 1D05 binding by at least 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80% in order of increasing preference (even more preferably, at least 90% and, most preferably, at least 95%) at 1 &#x3bc;M or less with 1D05 at or below its K<sub>D</sub>, and in particular those molecules that antagonize (i) PCSK9 binding to the LDL receptor, (ii) PCSK9 internalization into cells, or (iii) both PCSK9 binding to the LDL receptor and PCSK9 internalization into cells. Competition between binding members may be readily assayed in vitro for example using ELISA and/or by monitoring the interaction of the antibodies with PCSK9 in solution. The exact means for conducting the analysis is not critical. PCSK9 may be immobilized to a 96-well plate or may be placed in a homogenous solution. In specific embodiments, the ability of unlabeled candidate antibody(ies) to block the binding of labeled 1D05 can be measured using radioactive, enzyme or other labels. In the reverse assay, the ability of unlabeled antibodies to interfere with the interaction of labeled 1D05 with PCSK9 wherein said 1D05 and PCSK9 are already bound is determined. In specific embodiments, (i) PCSK9 is contacted with labeled 1D05 (an antibody molecule which comprises a VL comprising SEQ ID NO: 27 and a VH comprising SEQ ID NO: 11); (ii) PCSK9 is contacted with the candidate antibody or pool of antibodies; and (iii) antibodies capable of interrupting or preventing complexes between PCSK9 and 1D05 are identified. The readout in such an example is through measurement of bound label. 1D05 and the candidate antibody(ies) may be added in any order or at the same time. A specific assay that may be run is that of Example 13 where the activity of an antibody found to bind to the same epitope domain as 1D05 is illustrated.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Antibodies identified as 1D05 competitors in the above or other suitable assays may be tested for the ability to antagonize or neutralize (i) PCSK9 binding to the LDL receptor; and/or (ii) PCSK9 internalization into cells.

In specific embodiments, the inhibition demonstrated by the competing antibody is at least about 10% inhibition. In other embodiments, the inhibition is at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95%.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The present invention specifically encompasses PCSK9-specific antagonists and particularly monoclonal antibody molecules (and their corresponding amino acid and nucleic acid sequences) that selectively bind to the epitope identified for 1D05 or an overlapping epitope interfering with 1D05's binding to PCSK9.

The narrow epitope comprising these amino acid residues is represented by SEQ ID NO: 37 and falls within the area of SEQ ID NO: 39 of human PCSK9 and SEQ ID NO: 41 of murine PCSK9. A secondary footprint of the antibody is represented by SEQ ID NO: 42. Monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the conformational epitope represented by SEQ ID NO: 37 and SEQ ID NO:42 or an overlapping epitope antagonize or neutralize (i) PCSK9 binding to the LDL receptor; (ii) PCSK9 internalization into cells, or (iii) both.

Still another way to determine whether a peptide has the specificity of the 1D05 antibody molecule is to pre-incubate the 1D05 antibody molecule with PCSK9 with which it is normally reactive, and then add the peptide being tested with demonstrated specificity for PCSK9 to determine whether the peptide is inhibited in its ability to bind PCSK9.

Antagonists bearing such conservative amino acid substitutions can be tested for retained or better activity using functional assays available in the art or described herein. PCSK9-specific antagonists possessing one or more conservative amino acid substitutions which retain the ability to selectively bind to human PCSK9 and antagonize PCSK9 functioning at a level the same or better than 1D05 antibody molecules as described herein are referred to herein as &#x201c;functional equivalents&#x201d; of the disclosed antagonists and form specific embodiments of the present invention. Conservative amino acid substitutions are often ones in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Such modifications are not designed to significantly reduce or alter the binding or functional inhibition characteristics of the PCSK9-specific antagonist, albeit they may improve such properties. The purpose for making a substitution is not significant and can include, but is by no means limited to, replacing a residue with one better able to maintain or enhance the structure of the molecule, the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule, or the size of the molecule. For instance, one may desire simply to substitute a less desired residue with one of the same polarity or charge. Such modifications can be introduced by standard techniques known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. One specific means by which those of skill in the art accomplish conservative amino acid substitutions is alanine scanning mutagenesis as discussed in, for example, MacLennan et al., 1998 <i>Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. </i>643:55-67, and Sasaki et al., 1998 <i>Adv. Biophys. </i>35:1-24.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In another aspect, the present invention provides isolated PCSK9-specific antagonists and, in more specific embodiments, antibody molecules which comprise heavy and/or light chain variable regions comprising amino acid sequences that are homologous to the corresponding amino acid sequences of the disclosed antibodies, wherein the antibody molecules inhibit PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake.

One method of obtaining such sequences, which is not the only method available to the skilled artisan, is to mutate sequence encoding the PCSK9-specific antagonist or specificity-determining region(s) thereof, express an antagonist comprising the mutated sequence(s), and test the encoded antagonist for retained function using available functional assays including those described herein. Mutation may be by site-directed or random mutagenesis. As one of skill in the art will appreciate, however, other methods of mutagenesis can readily bring about the same effect. For example, in certain methods, the spectrum of mutants are constrained by non-randomly targeting conservative substitutions based on either amino acid chemical or structural characteristics, or else by protein structural considerations. In affinity maturation experiments, several such mutations may be found in a single selected molecule, whether they are randomly or non-randomly selected. There are also various structure-based approaches toward affinity maturation as demonstrated in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,117,096, PCT Pub.

One means by which this can be achieved is described in Marks et al., 1992 <i>Bio/Technology </i>10:779-783; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. A variable heavy domain may be paired with a variable light domain to provide an antigen binding site. In addition, independent regions (e.g., a variable heavy domain alone) may be used to bind antigen. The artisan is well aware, as well, that two domains of an Fv fragment, VL and VH, while perhaps coded by separate genes, may be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (scFvs).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Specific embodiments provide the CDR(s) in germline framework regions. Framework regions, including but not limited to human framework regions, are known to those of skill in the art (e.g., a human or non-human framework).

The invention also encompasses antibody molecules produced by the process of veneering; see, e.g., Mark et al., 1994 Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, vol. 113: The pharmacology of monoclonal Antibodies, Springer-Verlag, pp. 105-134; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. &#x201c;Human&#x201d; in reference to the disclosed antibody molecules specifically refers to antibody molecules having variable and/or constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences, wherein said sequences may, but need not, be modified/altered to have certain amino acid substitutions or residues that are not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequence. Such mutations can be introduced by methods including, but not limited to, random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro, or by somatic mutation in vivo. Specific examples of mutation techniques discussed in the literature are that disclosed in Gram et al., 1992 <i>PNAS USA </i>89:3576-3580; Barbas et al., 1994 <i>PNAS USA </i>91:3809-3813, and Schier et al., 1996 <i>J.

There are a plethora of mutation techniques in the scientific literature which are available to, and widely appreciated by, the skilled artisan. &#x201c;Humanized&#x201d; in reference to the disclosed antibody molecules refers specifically to antibody molecules wherein CDR sequences derived from another mammalian species, such as a mouse, are grafted onto human framework sequences. &#x201c;Primatized&#x201d; in reference to the disclosed antibody molecules refers to antibody molecules wherein CDR sequences of a non-primate are inserted into primate framework sequences, see, e.g., WO 93/02108 and WO 99/55369; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Specific antibodies of the present invention are monoclonal antibodies and, in particular embodiments, are in one of the following antibody formats: IgD, IgA, IgE, IgM, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4 or any derivative of any of the foregoing. The language &#x201c;derivatives thereof&#x201d; or &#x201c;derivatives&#x201d; in this respect includes, inter alia, (i) antibodies and antibody molecules with conservative modifications in one or both variable regions (i.e., VH and/or VL), (ii) antibodies and antibody molecules with manipulations in the constant regions of the heavy and/or light chains, and/or (iii) antibodies and antibody molecules that contain additional chemical moieties which are not normally a part of the immunoglobulin molecule (e.g., pegylation).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Manipulations of the variable regions can be within one or more of the VH and/or VL CDR regions.

Typically, such framework modifications are made to decrease the immunogenicity of the antibody. For example, one approach is to &#x201c;backmutate&#x201d; one or more framework residues to the corresponding germline sequence. More specifically, an antibody that has undergone somatic mutation may contain framework residues that differ from the germline sequence from which the antibody is derived. Such residues can be identified by comparing the antibody framework sequences to the germline sequences from which the antibody is derived. Such &#x201c;backmutated&#x201d; antibodies are also intended to be encompassed by the invention. Another type of framework modification involves mutating one or more residues within the framework region, or even within one or more CDR regions, to remove T cell epitopes to thereby reduce the potential immunogenicity of the antibody. This approach is also referred to as &#x201c;deimmunization&#x201d; and is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030153043 by Carr et al; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In addition or alternative to modifications made within the framework or CDR regions, antibodies of the invention may be engineered to include modifications within the Fc or constant regions, where present, typically to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody, such as serum half-life, complement fixation, Fc receptor binding, and/or antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The concept of generating &#x201c;hybrids&#x201d; or &#x201c;combinatorial&#x201d; IgG forms comprising various antibody isotypes to hone in on desired effector functionality has generally been described; see, e.g., Tao et al., 1991 <i>J.

The difference can be, for example, that they are of a different purity than that found in nature, or that they are of a different structure or form part of a different structure than that found in nature. An example of nucleic acid not found in nature is, for example, nucleic acid substantially free of other cellular material. The nucleic acid may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or in a partially purified or substantially pure form.

Methods for hybridizing nucleic acids are well-known in the art; see, e.g., Ausubel, <i>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</i>, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, N.Y., 6.3.1-6.3.6, 1989. Stringent hybridization conditions involve hybridizing at 68&#xb0; C. in 5&#xd7;SSC/5&#xd7;Denhardt's solution (or equivalent)/1.0% SDS, and washing in 0.2&#xd7;SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature. Moderately stringent conditions include washing in 3&#xd7;SSC at 42&#xb0; C. The parameters of salt concentration and temperature can be varied to achieve the optimal level of identity between the probe and the target nucleic acid. The skilled artisan can manipulate various hybridization and/or washing conditions to specifically target nucleic acid in the hybridizing portion that is at least 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, or 99% identical to SEQ ID NO: 12 and/or SEQ ID NO: 28. Basic parameters affecting the choice of hybridization conditions and guidance for devising suitable conditions are set forth by Sambrook et al., <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual</i>, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., chapters 9 and 11, 1989 and Ausubel et al. (eds), <i>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</i>, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc., sections 2.10 and 6.3-6.4, 1995 (the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference), and can be readily determined by those having ordinary skill in the art. PCSK9 antagonists having one or more variable regions comprising nucleic acid which hybridizes to the complement of nucleic acid consisting of SEQ ID NO: 12 and/or SEQ ID NO: 28 under stringent hybridization conditions should be effective in antagonizing one or more functions of PCSK9. Said antagonists and encoding nucleic acid, thus, form important embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In another aspect, the present invention provides vectors comprising the nucleic acid disclosed herein. Vectors in accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, plasmids and other expression constructs (e.g., phage or phagemid, as appropriate) suitable for the expression of the desired antibody molecule at the appropriate level for the intended purpose; see, e.g., Sambrook &#x26; Russell, <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual: </i>3<sup>rd </sup><i>Edition</i>, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. For most cloning purposes, DNA vectors may be used. Typical vectors include plasmids, modified viruses, bacteriophage, cosmids, yeast artificial chromosomes, bacterial artificial chromosomes, and other forms of episomal or integrated DNA. It is well within the purview of the skilled artisan to determine an appropriate vector for a particular gene transfer, generation of a recombinant PCSK9-specific antagonist, or other use. In specific embodiments, in addition to a recombinant gene, the vector may also contain an origin of replication for autonomous replication in a host cell, appropriate regulatory sequences, such as a promoter, a termination sequence, a polyadenylation sequence, an enhancer sequence, a selectable marker, a limited number of useful restriction enzyme sites, and/or other sequences as appropriate and the potential for high copy number. Examples of expression vectors for the production of protein-specific antagonists are well known in the art; see, e.g., Persic et al., 1997 <i>Gene </i>187:9-18; Boel et al., 2000 <i>J. Immunol. Methods </i>239:153-166, and Liang et al., 2001 <i>J. Immunol. Methods </i>247:119-130; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. If desired, nucleic acid encoding the antagonist may be integrated into the host chromosome using techniques well known in the art; see, e.g., Ausubel, <i>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</i>, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, 1999, and Marks et al., International Application Number WO 95/17516. Nucleic acid may also be expressed on plasmids maintained episomally or incorporated into an artificial chromosome; see, e.g., Csonka et al., 2000 <i>J. Cell Science </i>113:3207-3216; Vanderbyl et al., 2002 <i>Molecular Therapy </i>5:10. Specifically with regards to antibody molecules, the antibody light chain gene and the antibody heavy chain gene can be inserted into separate vectors or, more typically, both genes may be inserted into the same expression vector. Nucleic acid encoding any PCSK9-specific antagonist or component thereof can be inserted into an expression vector using standard methods (e.g., ligation of complementary restriction sites on the nucleic acid fragment and vector, or blunt end ligation if no restriction sites are present). Another specific example of how this may be carried out is through use of recombinational methods, e.g. the Clontech &#x201c;InFusion&#x201d; system, or Invitrogen &#x201c;TOPO&#x201d; system (both in vitro), or intracellularly (e.g. the Cre-Lox system). Specifically with regards to antibody molecules, the light and heavy chain variable regions can be used to create full-length antibody genes of any antibody isotype by inserting them into expression vectors already encoding heavy chain constant and light chain constant regions of the desired isotype such that the VH segment is operatively linked to the CH segment(s) within the vector and the VL segment is operatively linked to the CL segment within the vector. Additionally or alternatively, the recombinant expression vector comprising nucleic acid encoding a PCSK9-specific antagonist can encode a signal peptide that facilitates secretion of the antagonist from a host cell. The nucleic acid can be cloned into the vector such that the nucleic acid encoding a signal peptide is linked in-frame adjacent to the PCSK9-specific antagonist-encoding nucleic acid. The signal peptide may be an immunoglobulin or a non-immunoglobulin signal peptide. Any technique available to the skilled artisan may be employed to introduce the nucleic acid into the host cell; see, e.g., Morrison, 1985 <i>Science, </i>229:1202. Methods of subcloning nucleic acid molecules of interest into expression vectors, transforming or transfecting host cells containing the vectors, and methods of making substantially pure protein comprising the steps of introducing the respective expression vector into a host cell, and cultivating the host cell under appropriate conditions are well known. The PCSK9-specific antagonist so produced may be harvested from the host cells in conventional ways. Techniques suitable for the introduction of nucleic acid into cells of interest will depend on the type of cell being used. General techniques include, but are not limited to, calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran, electroporation, liposome-mediated transfection and transduction using viruses appropriate to the cell line of interest (e.g., retrovirus, vaccinia, baculovirus, or bacteriophage).</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In another aspect, the present invention provides isolated cell(s) comprising nucleic acid encoding disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists.

Preferred embodiments herein have the appropriate glycosylation; see, e., Yoo et al., 2002 <i>J. Immunol. Methods </i>261:1-20; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Naturally occurring antibodies contain at least one N-linked carbohydrate attached to a heavy chain. Id. Different types of mammalian host cells can be used to provide for efficient post-translational modifications.

One example by which to generate particular desired heavy and/or light chain sequence or fragment is to first amplify (and modify) the germline heavy and/or light chain variable sequences or fragment using PCR. Germline sequence for human heavy and/or light variable regions are readily available to the skilled artisan, see, e.g., the &#x201c;Vbase&#x201d; human germline sequence database, and Kabat, E.

Mutagenesis of germline sequences may be carried out using standard methods, e.g., PCR-mediated mutagenesis where the mutations are incorporated into PCR primers, or site-directed mutagenesis. If full-length antibodies are desired, sequence is available for the human heavy chain constant region genes; see, e.g., Kabat. E. A. et al., 1991 <i>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest</i>, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242. Fragments containing these regions may be obtained, for example, by standard PCR amplification. Alternatively, the skilled artisan can avail him/herself of vectors already encoding heavy and/or light chain constant regions.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Available techniques exist to recombinantly produce other antibody molecules which retain the specificity of an original antibody. A specific example of this is where DNA encoding the immunoglobulin variable region or the CDRs is introduced into the constant regions, or constant regions and framework regions, or simply the framework regions, of another antibody molecule; see, e.g., EP-184,187, GB 2188638, and EP-239400; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Basic techniques for the preparation of monoclonal antibodies are described in the literature, see, e.g., Kohler and Milstein (1975<i>, Nature </i>256:495-497); the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Fully human monoclonal antibodies can be produced by available methods. These methods include, but are by no means limited to, the use of genetically engineered mouse strains which possess an immune system whereby the mouse antibody genes have been inactivated and in turn replaced with a repertoire of functional human antibody genes, while leaving other components of the mouse immune system unchanged. Such genetically engineered mice allow for the natural in vivo immune response and affinity maturation process which results in high affinity, full human monoclonal antibodies.

Functional studies can then be carried out to ensure proper functionality, e.g., inhibition of PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake. There are various techniques available to the skilled artisan for the selection of protein-specific molecules from libraries using enrichment technologies including, but not limited to, phage display (e.g., see technology from Cambridge Antibody Technology (&#x201c;CAT&#x201d;) disclosed in U.S. Pat.

A library, for example, can be displayed on the surface of bacteriophage particles, with nucleic acid encoding the PCSK9-specific antagonist or fragment thereof expressed and displayed on its surface. Nucleic acid may then be isolated from bacteriophage particles exhibiting the desired level of activity and the nucleic acid used in the development of desired antagonist. Phage display has been thoroughly described in the literature; see, e.g., Kontermann &#x26; Stefan, supra, and International Application Number WO 92/01047; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Specifically with regard to antibody molecules, individual heavy or light chain clones in accordance with the present invention may also be used to screen for complementary heavy or light chains, respectively, capable of interaction therewith to form a molecule of the combined heavy and light chains; see, e.g., International Application Number WO 92/01047. Any method of panning which is available to the skilled artisan may be used to identify PCSK9-specific antagonists. Another specific method for accomplishing this is to pan against the target antigen in solution, e.g. biotinylated, soluble PCSK9, and then capture the PCSK9-specific antagonist-phage complexes on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, which are then washed to remove nonspecifically-bound phage. The captured phage can then be recovered from the beads in the same way they would be recovered from the surface of a plate, (e.g. DTT) as described herein.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">PCSK9-specific antagonists may be purified by techniques available to one of skill in the art. Titers of the relevant antagonist preparation, ascites, hybridoma culture fluids, or relevant sample may be determined by various serological or immunological assays which include, but are not limited to, precipitation, passive agglutination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent antibody (&#x201c;ELISA&#x201d;) techniques and radioimmunoassay (&#x201c;RIA&#x201d;) techniques.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The present invention relates in part to methods employing PCSK9-specific antagonists described herein for antagonizing PCSK9 function; said methods of which are further described below. Use of the term &#x201c;antagonizing&#x201d; throughout the present application refers to the act of opposing, inhibiting, counteracting, neutralizing or curtailing one or more functions of PCSK9. Inhibition or antagonism of one or more of PCSK9-associated functional properties can be readily determined according to methodologies known to the art (see, e.g., Barak &#x26; Webb, 1981 <i>J. Cell Biol. </i>90:595-604; Stephan &#x26; Yurachek, 1993 <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>34:325330; and McNamara et al., 2006 <i>Clinica Chimica Acta </i>369:158-167) as well as those described herein. Inhibition or antagonism will effectuate a decrease in PCSK9 activity relative to that seen in the absence of the antagonist or, for example, that seen when a control antagonist of irrelevant specificity is present. Preferably, a PCSK9-specific antagonist in accordance with the present invention antagonizes PCSK9 functioning to the point that there is a decrease of at least 10%, of the measured parameter including but not limited to the activities disclosed herein, and more preferably, a decrease of at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 95% of the measured parameter. Such inhibition/antagonism of PCSK9 functioning is particularly effective in those instances where PCSK9 functioning is contributing at least in part to a particular phenotype, disease, disorder or condition which is negatively impacting the subject.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for antagonizing the activity of PCSK9, which comprises contacting a cell, population of cells or tissue sample capable of being affected by PCSK9 (i.e., which expresses and/or comprises LDL receptors) with a PCSK9-specific antagonist disclosed herein under conditions that allow said antagonist to bind to PCSK9 when present and inhibit PCSK9's inhibition of cellular LDL uptake. Specific embodiments of the present invention include such methods wherein the cell is a human cell. Additional embodiments of the present invention include such methods wherein the cell is a murine cell.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for antagonizing the activity of PCSK9 in a subject, which comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the present invention. In specific embodiments, the methods for antagonizing PCSK9 function are for the treatment of a PCSK9-associated disease, disorder or condition or, alternatively, a disease, disorder or condition that could benefit from the effects of a PCSK9 antagonist. The medicament would be useful in a subject(s) exhibiting a condition associated with PCSK9 activity, or a condition where the functioning of PCSK9 is contraindicated for a particular subject. In select embodiments, the condition may be hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome or related conditions.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The present invention, thus, contemplates the use of PCSK9-specific antagonists described herein in various methods of treatment where antagonizing PCSK9 function is desirable. The method of treatment can be prophylactic or therapeutic in nature. In specific embodiments, the present invention relates to a method of treatment for a condition associated with/attributed to PCSK9 activity, or a condition where the functioning of PCSK9 is contraindicated for a particular subject, which comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the present invention. In select embodiments, the condition may be hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome or related conditions.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Methods of treatment in accordance with the present invention comprise administering to an individual a therapeutically (or prophylactically) effective amount of a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the present invention. Use of the terms &#x201c;therapeutically effective&#x201d; or &#x201c;prophylactically effective&#x201d; in reference to an amount refers to the amount necessary at the intended dosage to achieve the desired therapeutic/prophylactic effect for the period of time desired. The desired effect may be, for example, amelioration of at least one symptom associated with the treated condition. These amounts will vary, as the skilled artisan will appreciate, according to various factors, including but not limited to the disease state, age, sex and weight of the individual, and the ability of the PCSK9-specific antagonist to elicit the desired effect in the individual. The response may be documented by in vitro assay, in vivo non-human animal studies, and/or further supported from clinical trials.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The PCSK9-specific antagonist may be administered as a pharmaceutical composition. The present invention, thus, provides a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier including but not limited to an excipient, diluent, stabilizer, buffer, or alternative designed to facilitate administration of the antagonist in the desired format and amount to the treated individual.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The pharmaceutical composition may be formulated by any number of strategies known in the art, see, e.g., McGoff and Scher, 2000 <i>Solution Formulation of Proteins/Peptides</i>: In&#x2014;McNally, E.

A pharmaceutically acceptable composition suitable for patient administration will contain an effective amount of the PCSK9-specific antagonist in a formulation which both retains biological activity while also promoting maximal stability during storage within an acceptable temperature range.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The antagonist-based pharmaceutically acceptable composition may, in particular embodiments, be in liquid or solid form, or in the form of gas particles or aerosolized particles. Any technique for production of liquid or solid formulations may be utilized. Such techniques are well within the realm of the abilities of the skilled artisan. Solid formulations may be produced by any available method including, but not limited to, lyophilization, spray drying, or drying by supercritical fluid technology. Solid formulations for oral administration may be in any form rendering the antagonist accessible to the patient in the prescribed amount and within the prescribed period of time. The oral formulation can take the form of a number of solid formulations including, but not limited to, a tablet, capsule, or powder. Solid formulations may alternatively be lyophilized and brought into solution prior to administration for either single or multiple dosing according to methods well known to the skilled artisan. Antagonist compositions should generally be formulated within a biologically relevant pH range and may be buffered to maintain a proper pH range during storage. Both liquid and solid formulations generally require storage at lower temperatures (e.g., 2-8&#xb0; C.) in order to retain stability for longer periods. Formulated antagonist compositions, especially liquid formulations, may contain a bacteriostat to prevent or minimize proteolysis during storage, including but not limited to effective concentrations (e.g., &#x2266;1% w/v) of benzyl alcohol, phenol, m-cresol, chlorobutanol, methylparaben, and/or propylparaben. A bacteriostat may be contraindicated for some patients. Therefore, a lyophilized formulation may be reconstituted in a solution either containing or not containing such a component. Additional components may be added to either a buffered liquid or solid antagonist formulation, including but not limited to sugars as a cryoprotectant (including but not limited to polyhydroxy hydrocarbons such as sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol, and dulcitol and/or disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose, maltose, or trehalose) and, in some instances, a relevant salt (including but not limited to NaCl, KCl, or LiCl). Such antagonist formulations, especially liquid formulations slated for long term storage, will rely on a useful range of total osmolarity to both promote long term stability at temperatures of, for example, 2-8&#xb0; C. or higher, while also making the formulation useful for parenteral injection. As appropriate, preservatives, stabilizers, buffers, antioxidants and/or other additives may be included. The formulations may contain a divalent cation (including but not limited to MgCl2, CaCl2, and MnCl2); and/or a non-ionic surfactant (including but not limited to Polysorbate-80 (Tween 80&#x2122;), Polysorbate-60 (Tween 60&#x2122;), Polysorbate-40 (Tween 40&#x2122;), and Polysorbate-20 (Tween 20&#x2122;), polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, including but not limited to Brij 58&#x2122;, Brij35&#x2122;, as well as others such as Triton X-100&#x2122;, Triton X-114&#x2122;, NP40&#x2122;, Span 85 and the Pluronic series of non-ionic surfactants (e.g., Pluronic 121)).

Rev. &#x201c;Stable&#x201d; as used herein refers to the property of the protein or PCSK9-specific antagonist to retain its physical or chemical stability, conformational integrity, or its ability to exhibit less denaturation, protein clipping, aggregation, fragmentation, acidic variant formation or loss of biological activity compared with a control sample at a temperature in the range of 4-37&#xb0; C. for at least about 30 days. Other embodiments remain stable for up to 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years or longer periods at the above temperatures. In specific embodiments the formulation exhibits no significant changes at 2-8&#xb0; C. for at least 6 months, and preferably 12 months, 2 years or longer, in order of preference. Specific embodiments experience less than 10% or, in particular embodiments, less than 5% of denaturation, protein clipping, aggregation, fragmentation, acidic variant formation or loss of biological activity compared with a control sample at a temperature in the range of 25-45&#xb0; C. (or alternatively 2-8&#xb0; C.) for at least about 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years or longer. Stability of the formulations can be tested via several means known to the skilled artisan including, but not limited to Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC-HPLC) to measure aggregation and fragmentation, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) to measure particle size of concentrated samples, capillary SDS-PAGE to measure fragmentation and capillary iso-electric focusing (cIEF) or cation exchange chromatography (&#x201c;CEX&#x201d;) to measure acidic variants formation. Techniques suitable for the analysis of protein stability are well understood by those of skill in the art: see review in <i>Peptide and Protein Drug Delivery, </i>247-301, Vincent Lee Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., Pubs. (1991) and Jones, 1993 <i>Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. </i>10:29-90.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Pharmaceutical compositions as described herein should be sterile. There are various techniques available to the skilled artisan to accomplish this including, but not limited to, filtration through sterile filtration membranes. In specific embodiments, employing lyophilized and reconstituted compositions, this may be done prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Dosing of antagonist therapeutics is well within the realm of the skilled artisan, see, e.g., Lederman et al., 1991 <i>Int. J. Cancer </i>47:659-664; Bagshawe et al., 1991 <i>Antibody, Immunoconjugates and Radiopharmaceuticals </i>4:915-922, and will vary based on a number of factors including but not limited to the particular PCSK9-specific antagonist utilized, the patient being treated, the condition of the patient, the area being treated, the route of administration, and the treatment desired. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective therapeutic amount of the antagonist. Dosage ranges may be from about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.05 to 25 mg/kg, of the host body weight. For example, dosages can be 0.3 mg/kg body weight, 1 mg/kg body weight, 3 mg/kg body weight, 5 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg. For purposes of illustration, and not limitation, in specific embodiments, a dose of 5 mg to 2.0 g may be utilized to deliver the antagonist systemically. Optimal precision in achieving concentrations of antagonist within a range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the drug's availability to the target site(s). This involves a consideration of the distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of the PCSK9-specific antagonist. Antagonists described herein may be used alone at appropriate dosages. Alternatively, co-administration or sequential administration of other agents may be desirable. It will be possible to present a therapeutic dosing regime for the PCSK9-specific antagonists of the present invention in conjunction with alternative treatment regimes. For example, PCSK9-specific antagonists may be used in combination or in conjunction with other drugs (therapeutic and/or prophylactic), including but not limited to cholesterol-lowering drugs, for example, cholesterol absorption inhibitors (e.g., Zetia&#xae;) and cholesterol synthesis inhibitors (e.g., Zocor&#xae; and Vytorin&#xae;). The present invention contemplates such combinations and they form an important embodiment hereof. Accordingly, the present invention relates to methods of treatment as described above where the PCSK9-specific antagonist is administered/delivered simultaneously with, following or prior to another drug or drugs (therapeutic and/or prophylactic), including but not limited to cholesterol-lowering drugs, cholesterol absorption inhibitors and cholesterol absorption inhibitors.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Individuals (subjects) capable of treatment as described herein include primates, human and non-human, and include any non-human mammal or vertebrate of commercial or domestic veterinary importance.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The PCSK9-specific antagonist may be administered to an individual by any route of administration appreciated in the art, including but not limited to oral administration, administration by injection (specific embodiments of which include intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection), administration by inhalation, intranasal, or topical administration, either alone or in combination with other agents designed to assist in the treatment of the individual. The PCSK9-specific antagonist may also be administered by injection devices, injector pens, needleless devices; and subcutaneous patch delivery systems. The route of administration should be determined based on a number of considerations appreciated by the skilled artisan including, but not limited to, the desired physiochemical characteristics of the treatment. Treatment may be provided on a daily, weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis, or any other regimen that delivers the appropriate amount of PCSK9-specific antagonist to the individual at the prescribed times such that the desired treatment is effected and maintained. The formulations may be administered in a single dose or in more than one dose at separate times.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Also contemplated are methods of using the disclosed antagonists in the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of a PCSK9-associated disease, disorder or condition or, alternatively, a disease, disorder or condition that could benefit from the effects of a PCSK9 antagonist. The medicament would be useful in a subject(s) exhibiting a condition associated with PCSK9 activity, or a condition where the functioning of PCSK9 is contraindicated for a particular subject. In select embodiments, the condition may be hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome or related conditions.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">PCSK9-specific antagonists disclosed herein may also be used as a method of diagnosis of PCSK9. In select embodiments, the present invention encompasses methods of identifying or quantifying the level of PCSK9 present in a sample (including but not limited to a biological sample, e.g., serum or blood) which comprises contacting the sample with a PCSK9-specific antagonist described herein and detecting or quantifying, respectively, binding to PCSK9. The PCSK9-specific antagonist may be used in various assay formats known to the skilled artisan and may form part of a kit (the general features of a kit of which are further described below).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">The present invention further provides for the administration of disclosed anti-PCSK9 antagonists for purposes of gene therapy. Through such methods, cells of a subject are transformed with nucleic acid encoding a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the invention. Subjects comprising the nucleic acids then produce the PCSK9-specific antagonists endogenously. Previously, Alvarez, et al, <i>Clinical Cancer Research </i>6:3081-3087, 2000, introduced single-chain anti-ErbB2 antibodies to subjects using a gene therapy approach. The methods disclosed by Alvarez, et al, supra, may be easily adapted for the introduction of nucleic acids encoding an anti-PCSK9 antibody of the invention to a subject.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Nucleic acids encoding any PCSK9-specific antagonist may be introduced to a subject.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">The nucleic acids may be introduced to the cells of a subject by any means known in the art. In preferred embodiments, the nucleic acids are introduced as part of a viral vector. Examples of preferred viruses from which the vectors may be derived include lentiviruses, herpes viruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, vaccinia virus, baculovirus, alphavirus, influenza virus, and other recombinant viruses with desirable cellular tropism.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Various companies produce viral vectors commercially, including, but by no means limited to, Avigen, Inc. (Alameda, Calif.; AAV vectors), Cell Genesys (Foster City, Calif.; retroviral, adenoviral, AAV vectors, and lentiviral vectors), Clontech (retroviral and baculoviral vectors), Genovo, Inc. (Sharon Hill, Pa.; adenoviral and AAV vectors), Genvec (adenoviral vectors), IntroGene (Leiden, Netherlands; adenoviral vectors), Molecular Medicine (retroviral, adenoviral, AAV, and herpes viral vectors), Norgen (adenoviral vectors), Oxford BioMedica (Oxford, United Kingdom; lentiviral vectors), and Transgene (Strasbourg, France; adenoviral, vaccinia, retroviral, and lentiviral vectors).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Methods for constructing and using viral vectors are known in the art (see, e.g., Miller, et al, <i>BioTechniques </i>7:980-990, 1992). Preferably, the viral vectors are replication defective, that is, they are unable to replicate autonomously, and thus are not infectious, in the target cell. Preferably, the replication defective virus is a minimal virus, i.e., it retains only the sequences of its genome which are necessary for encapsidating the genome to produce viral particles. Defective viruses, which entirely or almost entirely lack viral genes, are preferred. Use of defective viral vectors allows for administration to cells in a specific, localized area, without concern that the vector can infect other cells. Thus, a specific tissue can be specifically targeted.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Examples of vectors comprising attenuated or defective DNA virus sequences include, but are not limited to, a defective herpes virus vector (Kanno et al, <i>Cancer Gen. Ther. </i>6:147-154, 1999; Kaplitt et al, <i>J. Neurosci. Meth. </i>71:125-132, 1997 and Kaplitt et al, <i>J. Neuro Onc. </i>19:137-147, 1994).</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">Adenoviruses are eukaryotic DNA viruses that can be modified to efficiently deliver a nucleic acid of the invention to a variety of cell types. Attenuated adenovirus vectors, such as the vector described by Strafford-Perricaudet et al, <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>90:626-630, 1992 are desirable in some instances. Various replication defective adenovirus and minimum adenovirus vectors have been described (PCT Publication Nos. WO94/26914, WO94/28938, WO94/28152, WO94/12649, WO95/02697 and WO96/22378). The replication defective recombinant adenoviruses according to the invention can be prepared by any technique known to a person skilled in the art (Levrero et al, <i>Gene </i>101:195, 1991; EP 185573; Graham, <i>EMBO J. </i>3:2917, 1984; Graham et al, <i>J. Gen. Virol. </i>36:59, 1977).</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">The adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are DNA viruses of relatively small size which can integrate, in a stable and site-specific manner, into the genome of the cells which they infect. They are able to infect a wide spectrum of cells without inducing any effects on cellular growth, morphology or differentiation, and they do not appear to be involved in human pathologies. The use of vectors derived from the AAVs for transferring genes in vitro and in vivo has been described (see Daly, et al, <i>Gene Ther. </i>8:1343-1346, 2001, Larson et al, <i>Adv. Exp. Med. Bio. </i>489:45-57, 2001; PCT Publication Nos. WO 91/18088 and WO 93/09239; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,797,368 and 5,139,941 and EP 488528B1).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">In another embodiment, the gene can be introduced in a retroviral vector, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,399,346, 4,650,764, 4,980,289, and 5,124,263; Mann et al, <i>Cell </i>33:153, 1983; Markowitz et al, <i>J. Virol., </i>62:1120, 1988; EP 453242 and EP178220. The retroviruses are integrating viruses which infect dividing cells.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Lentiviral vectors can be used as agents for the direct delivery and sustained expression of nucleic acids encoding a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the invention in several tissue types, including brain, retina, muscle, liver and blood. The vectors can efficiently transduce dividing and nondividing cells in these tissues, and maintain long-term expression of the PCSK9-specific antagonist. For a review, see Zufferey et al, <i>J. Virol. </i>72:9873-80, 1998 and Kafri et al, <i>Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. </i>3:316-326, 2001. Lentiviral packaging cell lines are available and known generally in the art. They facilitate the production of high-titer lentivirus vectors for gene therapy. An example is a tetracycline-inducible VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus packaging cell line which can generate virus particles at titers greater than 10<sup>6 </sup>IU/ml for at least 3 to 4 days; see Kafri et al, <i>J. Virol. </i>73:576-584, 1999. The vector produced by the inducible cell line can be concentrated as needed for efficiently transducing nondividing cells in vitro and in vivo.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">Sindbis virus is a member of the alphavirus genus and has been studied extensively since its discovery in various parts of the world beginning in 1953. Gene transduction based on alphavirus, particularly Sindbis virus, has been well-studied in vitro (see Straus et al, <i>Microbiol. Rev., </i>58:491-562, 1994; Bredenbeek et al, <i>J. Virol., </i>67:6439-6446, 1993; Ijima et al, <i>Int. J. Cancer </i>80:110-118, 1999 and Sawai et al, <i>Biochim. Biophyr. Res. Comm. </i>248:315-323, 1998. Many properties of alphavirus vectors make them a desirable alternative to other virus-derived vector systems being developed, including rapid engineering of expression constructs, production of high-titered stocks of infectious particles, infection of nondividing cells, and high levels of expression (Strauss et al, 1994 supra). Use of Sindbis virus for gene therapy has been described. (Wahlfors et al, <i>Gene. Ther. </i>7:472-480, 2000 and Lundstrom, <i>J. Recep. Sig. Transduct. Res. </i>19(1-4):673-686, 1999.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">In another embodiment, a vector can be introduced to cells by lipofection or with other transfection facilitating agents (peptides, polymers, etc.). Synthetic cationic lipids can be used to prepare liposomes for in vivo and in vitro transfection of a gene encoding a marker (Feigner et al, <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>84:7413-7417, 1987 and Wang et al, <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>84:7851-7855, 1987). Useful lipid compounds and compositions for transfer of nucleic acids are described in PCT Publication Nos. WO 95/18863 and WO 96/17823, and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,127.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">It is also possible to introduce the vector in vivo as a naked DNA plasmid. Naked DNA vectors for gene therapy can be introduced into desired host cells by methods known in the art, e.g., electroporation, microinjection, cell fusion, DEAE dextran, calcium phosphate precipitation, use of a gene gun, or use of a DNA vector transporter (see, e.g., Wilson, et al, <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>267:963-967, 1992; Williams et al, <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>88:2726-2730, 1991). Other reagents commonly used for transfection of plasmids include, but are by no means limited to, FuGene, Lipofectin, and Lipofectamine. Receptor-mediated DNA delivery approaches can also be used (Wu et al, <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>263:14621-14624, 1988). U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,580,859 and 5,589,466 disclose delivery of exogenous DNA sequences, free of transfection facilitating agents, in a mammal. Recently, a relatively low voltage, high efficiency in vivo DNA transfer technique, termed electrotransfer, has been described (Vilquin et al, <i>Gene Ther. </i>8:1097, 2001; Payen et al, <i>Exp. Hematol. </i>29:295-300, 2001; Mir, <i>Bioelectrochemistry </i>53:1-10, 2001; PCT Publication Nos.

Goers, J. 1993, Academic Press) or various purification protocols. The antagonists may have a label incorporated therein or affixed thereto to facilitate ready identification or measurement of the activities associated therewith.

Under these conditions, the endoproteases will cleave only the primary cleavage sites of the protein substrate (i.e., sites that are on the surface of the protein substrate and exposed to the solvent). The binding of 1D05 Fab to wt-hPCSK9 will mask some surface residues normally exposed to the solvent in both proteins. Therefore the primary sites cleaved in wt-hPCSK9 and not in the 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 complex correspond to residues of PCSK9 protected by 1D05 in the complex. Some of these residues are likely to be directly involved in 1D05 binding. The proteolytic peptides generated by wt-hPCSK9 and 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 limited proteolysis are identified and characterized by analysis of the digest by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS).

At periods of time 5, 15 and 30 minutes after endoprotease addition, an aliquot of sample was deposited onto the MALDI target and subjected to direct MALDI-MS analysis in the presence of sinapinic acid (SA) as matrix. The fragment peptides originated from wt-PCSK9 after incubation with the proteolytic enzyme at various time were compared with those originated from wt-hPCSK9 in the 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 complex sample to identify the residues protected from proteolysis in the 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 interaction.

The species at m/z 2279.3, 3909.9 and 4474.6 corresponding to peptides 200-218, 166-199 and 161-199 are detected only in the wt-hPCSK9 hydrolysis and indicate that residue Arg 199 is protected by 1D05 binding. These peptide fragments together with the species at m/z 5410.5, 5729.7, 5850.8, 6170.2 correspond to peptides 168-215, 166-215, 168-218, 166-218, detected only in wt-PCSK9 thus indicating protection also on residues Arg165 and Arg167.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0222">At 15 minutes of Trypsin incubation, protection on residue Arg199 is confirmed. In fact the species at m/z 2280.0, 3591.4, 3910.9 and 4475.6, all originated from cleavage at Arg199, are present only in the wt-PCSK9 hydrolysis and become more abundant. In addition, protection at Arg194 is detected (as shown by the presence of the specie at m/z 3325.7 in the wt-PCSK9 spectrum). The species originated from cleavage at Arg165 and Arg167 (m/z 5411.5, 5730.9, 5851.8 and 6171.6) are present in the wt-hPCSK9 hydrolysis and start to appear with much lower intensity also in the 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 complex proteolysis. This may indicate that the protection from proteolysis on such residues is due to steric hindrance of the Fab rather than to primary contacts between 1D05 and wt-PCSK9 residues.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0223">Results: With LP-MS using three enzymes of different specificity, we identified the surface area of wt-hPCSK9 protected by the 1D05 Fab in the 1D05-wt-hPCSK9. Arg165, Arg167, Asp169, Glu170, Arg194, Glu197 and Arg199 are the residues of wt-hPCSK9 protected upon binding to the 1D05 Fab (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). These residues belong to the catalytic domain of wt-hPCSK9 and are exposed on the surface of the molecule (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). In addition, the limited proteolysis with trypsin shows the possibility that residues 194-199 are directly involved in 1D05 binding whereas protection from proteolysis on residues Arg165 and Arg167 may be due to steric hindrance of the Fab instead of direct contacts between 1D05 and wt-PCSK9 residues.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0224">Residues in peptides R194-R199 are conserved in human and mouse PCSK9. 1D05 Fab recognizes human and mouse protein. As illustrated by the sequence alignment between human and mouse PCSK9 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>), the residues included in the peptide 194-199 of wt-PCSK9 and protected by 1D05 are conserved in both human and mouse PCSK9 while residues in peptide 165-169 (also protected by 1D05 binding) are not. This would support a hypothesis that only residues 194-199 are directly interacting with 1D05 while the others (165-169) are protected from proteolysis by steric hindrance.</p><heading id="h-0033" level="1">EXAMPLE 13</heading><heading id="h-0034" level="1">PCSK9/1D05 TR-FRET Assay</heading><p id="p-0222" num="0225">Anti-V5 antibody (QED Biosciences) was labeled and purified as described previously (see Fisher et al., 2007 <i>J.
