INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application relates to anti-PD-L1 antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof, nucleic acid encoding the same, therapeutic compositions thereof, and their use to enhance T-cell function to upregulate cell-mediated immune responses and for the treatment of T cell dysfunctional disorders, such as tumor immunity, for the treatment of and cancer.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="2">Lymphocyte Development and Activation</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The two major types of lymphocytes in humans are T (thymus-derived) and B (bone marrow derived. These cells are derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and fetal liver that have committed to the lymphoid development pathway. The progeny of these stem cells follow divergent pathways to mature into either B or T lymphocytes. Human B-lymphocyte development takes place entirely within the bone marrow. T cells, on the other hand, develop from immature precursors that leave the marrow and travel through the bloodstream to the thymus, where they proliferate and differentiate into mature T lymphocytes.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mature lymphocytes that emerge from the thymus or bone marrow are in a quiescent, or &#x201c;resting&#x201d; state, i.e., they are mitotically inactive. When dispersed into the bloodstream, these &#x201c;naive&#x201d; or &#x201c;virgin&#x201d; lymphocytes, travel into various secondary or peripheral lymphoid organs, such as the spleen, lymph nodes or tonsils. Most virgin lymphocytes have an inherently short life span and die without a few days after leaving the marrow or thymus. However, if such a cell receives signals that indicate the presence of an antigen, they may activate and undergo successive rounds of cell division. Some of the resulting progeny cells then revert to the resting state to become memory lymphocytes&#x2014;B and T cells that are essentially primed for the next encounter with the stimulating allergen. The other progeny of activated virgin lymphocytes are effector cells, which survive for only a few days, but carry out specific defensive activities.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lymphocyte activation refers to an ordered series of events through which a resting lymphocyte passes as it is stimulated to divide and produce progeny, some of which become effector cells. A full response includes both the induction of cell proliferation (mitogenesis) and the expression of immunologic functions. Lymphocytes become activated when specific ligands bind to receptors on their surfaces. The ligands are different for T cells and B cells, but the resulting intracellular physiological mechanisms are similar.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some foreign antigens themselves can induce lymphocyte activation, especially large polymeric antigens that cross-link surface immunoglobulins on B-cells, or other glycoproteins on T-cells. However, most antigens are not polymeric and even direct binding to B-cells in large numbers fail to result in activation. These more common antigens activate B cells when they are co-stimulated with nearby activated helper T-lymphocytes. Such stimulation may occur from lymphokines secreted by the T-cell, but is transmitted most efficiently by direct contact of the B cell with T-cell surface proteins that interact with certain B-cell surface receptors to generate a secondary signal.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="2">T-Cells</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">T lymphocytes do not express immunoglobulins, but, instead detect the presence of foreign substances by way of surface proteins called T-cell receptors (TCR). These receptors recognize antigens by either direct contact or through influencing the activity of other immune cells. Together with macrophages, T cells are the primary cell type involved in the cell-mediated immunity.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Unlike B-cells, T-cells can detect foreign substances only in specific contexts. In particular, T-lymphocytes will recognize a foreign protein only if it first cleaved into small peptides, which are then displayed on the surface of a second host cell, called an antigen-presenting cell (APC). Many types of host cells can present antigens under some conditions but certain types are more specifically adapted for this purpose and are particularly important in controlling T-cell activity, including macrophages and other B-cells. Antigen presentation depends in part on specific proteins, called major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, on the surface of the presenting cells. Thus, to stimulate cell-mediated immunity, foreign peptides must be presented to T-cells in combination with MHC peptides, and this combination must be recognized by a T-cell receptor.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There are two significant T-cell subsets: cytotoxic T lymphocytes (T<sub>c </sub>cells or CTLs) and helper T cells (TH) cells, which can roughly be identified on the basis of cell surface expression of the marker CD8 and CD4. T<sub>c </sub>cells are important in viral defense, and can kill viruses directly by recognizing certain cell surface expressed viral peptides. TH cells promote proliferation, maturation and immunologic function of other cell types, e.g., lymphokine secretion to control activities of B cells, macrophages and cytotoxic T cells. Both virgin and memory T-lymphocytes ordinarily remain in the resting state, and in this state they do not exhibit significant helper or cytotoxic activity. When activated, these cells undergo several rounds of mitotic division to produce daughter cells. Some of these daughter cells return to the resting state as memory cells, but others become effector cells that actively express helper or cytotoxic activity. These daughter cells resemble their parents: CD4+ cells can only product CD4+ progeny, while CD8+ cells yield only CD8+ progeny. Effector T-cells express cell surface markers that are not expressed on resting T-cells, such as CD25, CD28, CD29, CD40L, transferrin receptors and class II MHC proteins. When the activating stimuli is withdrawn, cytotoxic or helper activity gradually subsides over a period of several days as the effector cells either die or revert to the resting state. Similar to B-cell activation, T-lymphocyte responses to most antigens also require two types of simultaneous stimuli. The first is the antigen, which if appropriately displayed by MHC proteins on an antigen-presenting cell, can be recognized and bound by T-cell receptors. While this antigen-MHC complex does send a signal to the cell interior, it is usually insufficient to result in T-cell activation. Full activation, such as occurs with helper T-cells, requires costimulation with other specific ligands called costimulators that are expressed on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. Activation of a cytotoxic T cell, on the other hand, generally requires IL-2, a cytokine secreted by activated helper T cells.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">PD-1 Pathway</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An important negative co-stimulatory signal regulating T cell activation is provided by programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1)(CD279), and its ligand binding partners PD-L1 (B7-H1, CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC, CD273). The negative regulatory role of PD-1 was revealed by PD-1 knock outs (Pdcdl<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>), which are prone to autoimmunity. Nishimura et al, Immunity JJ.: 141-51 (1999); Nishimura et al, Science 291: 319-22 (2001). PD-1 is related to CD28 and CTLA-4, but lacks the membrane proximal cysteine that allows homodimerization. The cytoplasmic domain of PD-1 contains an immunoreceptor tyorine-based inhibition motif (ITIM, V/lxYxxLN). PD-1 only binds to PD-L1 and PD-L2. Freeman et al, J. Exp. Med. 192: 1-9 (2000); Dong et al, Nature Med. 5: 1365-1369 (1999); Latchman et al, Nature Immunol 2: 261-268 (2001); Tseng et al, J. Exp. Med. 193: 839-846 (2001).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">PD-1 can be expressed on T cells, B cells, natural killer T cells, activated monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs). PD-1 is expressed by activated, but not by unstimulated human CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, B cells and myeloid cells. This stands in contrast to the more restricted expression of CD28 and CTLA-4. Nishimura et al, Int. Immunol. 8: 773-80 (1996); Boettler et al, J. Virol. 80: 3532-40 (2006). There are at least 4 variants of PD-1 that have been cloned from activated human T cells, including transcripts lacking (i) exon 2, (ii) exon 3, (iii) exons 2 and 3 or (iv) exons 2 through 4. Nielsen et al, Cell. Immunol. 235: 109-16 (2005). With the exception of PD-1&#x394;ex3, all variants are expressed at similar levels as full length PD-1 in resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Expression of all variants is significantly induced upon activation of human T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. The PD-1&#x394;ex3 variants lacks a transmembrane domain, and resembles soluble CTLA-4, which plays an important role in autoimmunity. Ueda et al, Nature 423: 506-11 (2003). This variant is enriched in the synovial fluid and sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Wan et al, J. Immunol. 177: 8844-50 (2006). The two PD-1 ligands differ in their expression patterns. PD-L1 is constitutively expressed on mouse T and B cells, CDs, macrophages, mesenchymal stem cells and bone marrow-derived mast cells. Yamazaki et al, J. Immunol. 169: 5538-45 (2002). PD-L1 is expressed on a wide range of nonhematopoietic cells (e.g., cornea, lung, vascular epithelium, liver nonpar enchymal cells, mesenchymal stem cells, pancreatic islets, placental synctiotrophoblasts, keratinocytes, etc.) [Keir et al, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 26: 677-704 (2008)], and is upregulated on a number of cell types after activation. Both type I and type II interferons IFN's) upregulate PD-L1. Eppihimer et al, Microcirculation 9: 133-45 (2002); Schreiner et al, J. Neuroimmunol 155: 172-82 (2004). PD-L1 expression in cell lines is decreased when MyD88, TRAF6 and MEK are inhibited. Liu et al, Blood HO: 296-304 (2007). JAK2 has also been implicated in PD-L1 induction. Lee et al, FEBS Lett. 580: 755-62 (2006); Liu et al, Blood HO: 296-304 (2007). Loss or inhibition of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a cellular phosphatase that modified phosphatidylinosital 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt signaling, increased post-transcriptional PD-L1 expression in cancers. Parsa et al, Nat. Med. 13: 84-88 (2007). PD-L2 expression is more restricted than PD-L1. PD-L2 is inducibly expressed on DCs, macrophages, and bone marrow-derived mast cells. PD-L2 is also expressed on about half to two-thirds of resting peritoneal BI cells, but not on conventional B2 B cells. Zhong et al, Eur. J. Immunol. 37: 2405-10 (2007). PD-L2+BI cells bind phosphatidylcholine and may be important for innate immune responses against bacterial antigens. Induction of PD-L2 by IFN-&#x3b3; is partially dependent upon NF-KB. Liang et al, Eur. J. Immunol. 33_: 2706-16 (2003). PD-L2 can also be induced on monocytes and macrophages by GM-CF, IL-4 and IFN-&#x3b3;. Yamazaki et al., J. Immunol. 169: 5538-45 (2002); Loke et al, PNAS 100:5336-41 (2003). PD-1 signaling typically has a greater effect on cytokine production than on cellular proliferation, with significant effects on IFN-&#x3b3;, TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-2 production. PD-1 mediated inhibitory signaling also depends on the strength of the TCR signaling, with greater inhibition delivered at low levels of TCR stimulation. This reduction can be overcome by costimulation through CD28 [Freeman et al, J. Exp. Med. 192: 1027-34 (2000)] or the presence of IL-2 [Carter et al, Eur. J. Immunol. 32: 634-43 (2002)]. Evidence is mounting that signaling through PD-L1 and PD-L2 may be bidirectional. That is, in addition to modifying TCR or BCR signaling, signaling may also be delivered back to the cells expressing PD-L1 and PD-L2. While treatment of dendritric cells with a naturally human anti-PD-L2 antibody isolated from a patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia was not found to upregulate MHC II or B7 costimulatory molecules, such cells did produce greater amount of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-6, and stimulated T cell proliferation. Nguyen et al, J. Exp. Med. 196: 1393-98 (2002). Treatment of mice with this antibody also (1) enhanced resistance to transplated b16 melanoma and rapidly induced tumor-specific CTL. Radhakrishnan et al, J. Immunol. 170: 1830-38 (2003); Radhakrishnan et al, Cancer Res. 64: 4965-72 (2004); Heckman et al, Eur. J. Immunol. 37: 1827-35 (2007); (2) blocked development of airway inflammatory disease in a mouse model of allergic asthma. Radhakrishnan et al, J. Immunol. 173: 1360-65 (2004); Radhakrishnan et al, J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. UJy. 668-74 (2005).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further evidence of reverse signaling into dendritic cells (&#x201c;DCs&#x201d;) results from studies of bone marrow derived DCs cultured with soluble PD-1 (PD-1 EC domain fused to Ig constant region-&#x201c;s-PD-1&#x201d;). Kuipers et al, Eur. J. Immunol. 36: 2472-82 (2006). This sPD-1 inhibited DC activation and increased IL-10 production, in a manner reversible through administration of anti-PD-1. Additionally, several studies show a receptor for PD-L1 or PD-L2 that is independent of PD-1. B7.1 has already been identified as a binding partner for PD-1. Butte et al, Immunity 27: 111-22 (2007). Chemical crosslinking studies suggest that PD-L1 and B7.1 can interact through their IgV-like domains. B7.1:PD-L1 interactions can induce an inhibitory signal into T cells. Ligation of PD-L1 on CD4+ T cells by B7.1 or ligation of B7.1 on CD4+ T cells by PD-L1 delivers an inhibitory signal. T cells lacking CD28 and CTLA-4 show decreased proliferation and cytokine production when stimulated by anti-CD3 plus B7.1 coated beads. In T cells lacking all the receptors for B7.1 (i.e., CD28, CTLA-4 and PD-L1), T-cell proliferation and cytokine production were no longer inhibited by anti-CD3 plus B7.1 coated beads. This indicates that B7.1 acts specifically through PD-L1 on the T-cell in the absence of CD28 and CTLA-4. Similarly, T cells lacking PD-1 showed decreased proliferation and cytokine production when stimulated in the presence of anti-CD3 plus PD-L1 coated beads, demonstrating the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 ligation on B7.1 on T cells. When T cells lacking all known receptors for PD-L1 (i.e., no PD-1 and B7.1), T cell proliferation was no longer impaired by anti-CD3 plus PD-L1 coated beads. Thus, PD-L1 can exert an inhibitory effect on T cells either through B7.1 or PD-1.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The direct interaction between B7.1 and PD-L1 suggests that the current understanding of costimulation is incomplete, and underscores the significance to the expression of these molecules on T cells. Studies of PD-L1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> T cells indicate that PD-L1 on T cells can downregulate T cell cytokine production. Latchman et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101: 10691-96 (2004). Because both PD-L1 and B7.1 are expressed on T cells, B cells, DCs and macrophages, there is the potential for directional interactions between B7.1 and PD-L1 on these cells types. Additionally, PD-L1 on non-hematopoietic cells may interact with B7.1 as well as PD-1 on T cells, raising the question of whether PD-L1 is involved in their regulation. One possible explanation for the inhibitory effect of B7.1: PD-L1 interaction is that T cell PD-L1 may trap or segregate away APC B7.1 from interaction with CD28.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As a result, the antagonism of signaling through PD-L1, including blocking PD-L1 from interacting with either PD-1, B7.1 or both, thereby preventing PD-L1 from sending a negative co-stimulatory signal to T-cells and other antigen presenting cells is likely to enhance immunity in response to infection (e.g., acute and chronic) and tumor immunity. In addition, the anti-PD-L1 antibodies of the present invention, may be combined with antagonists of other components of PD-1: PD-L1 signaling, for example, antagonist anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L2 antibodies.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In particular, the inhibition of PD-L1 signaling has been proposed as a means to enhance T cell immunity for the treatment of cancer (e.g., tumor immunity) and infection, including both acute and chronic (e.g., persistent) infection.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Inhibitors blocking the PD-L1: PD-1 interaction are known from, i.a., WO2001014557, WO2002086083, WO2007005874, WO2010036959, WO2010077634 and WO2011066389.

The term includes the common elements of both exhaustion and/or anergy in which antigen recognition may occur, but the ensuing immune response is ineffective to control infection or tumor growth.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0098">&#x201c;Enhancing T-cell function&#x201d; means to induce, cause or stimulate a T-cell to have a sustained or amplified biological function, or renew or reactivate exhausted or inactive T-cells. Examples of enhancing T-cell function include: increased secretion of &#x3b3;-interferon from CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, increased proliferation, increased antigen responsiveness (e.g., viral or pathogen clearance) relative to such levels before the intervention. In one embodiment, the level of enhancement is as least 50%, alternatively 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 120%, 150%, 200%. The manner of measuring this enhancement is known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0099">A &#x201c;T cell dysfunctional disorder&#x201d; is a disorder or condition of T-cells characterized by decreased responsiveness to antigenic stimulation. In a particular embodiment, a T-cell dysfunctional disorder is a disorder that is specifically associated with inappropriate increased signaling through PD-1. In another embodiment, T-cell dysfunctional disorder is one in which T-cells are anergic or have decreased ability to secrete cytokines, proliferate, or execute cytolytic activity. In a specific aspect, the decreased responsiveness results in ineffective control of a pathogen or tumor expressing an immunogen. Examples of T cell dysfunctional disorders characterized by T-cell dysfunction include unresolved acute infection, chronic infection and tumor immunity.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0100">&#x201c;Tumor immunity&#x201d; refers to the process in which tumors evade immune recognition and clearance. Thus, as a therapeutic concept, tumor immunity is &#x201c;treated&#x201d; when such evasion is attenuated, and the tumors are recognized and attacked by the immune system. Examples of tumor recognition include tumor binding, tumor shrinkage and tumor clearance.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0101">The term &#x201c;vaccine&#x201d; as used herein includes any nonpathogenic immunogen that, when inoculated into a host, induces protective immunity against a specific pathogen. Vaccines can take many forms. Vaccines can be whole organisms that share important antigens with the pathogen, but are not pathogenic themselves (e.g., cowpox). Vaccines can also be prepared from killed (e.g., Salk polio vaccine) or attenuated (lost ability to produce disease&#x2014;e.g., Sabin polio vaccine). Vaccines can also be prepared from purified macromolecules isolated from the pathogenic organism. For example, toxoid vaccines (e.g., tetanus and diphtheria) containing the inactive form of soluble bacterial toxin&#x2014;resulting in the production of anti-toxin antibodies, but not immunity to the intact bacteria. Subunit vaccines (e.g., Hepatitis B) contain only a single immunogenic protein isolated from the pathogen of interest. Hapten conjugate vaccines attaches certain carbohydrate or polypeptide epitopes isolated from the pathogen of interest to immunogenic carriers, such as tetanus toxoid. These strategies essentially use the epitopes as haptens to induce antibody production, which then recognize the same epitope in the native pathogen. However, to be maximally effective, such vaccines must incorporate both B- and T-cell epitopes, and the T-cell epitopes must be chosen to ensure that they can be recognized, presented and responded to by the immune systems of the host individuals. DNA vaccines exploit the ability of host cells to take up and express DNA encoding pathogenic proteins that is injected intramuscularly. Host responses to immunogens can be enhanced if administered as a mixture with adjuvants. Immune adjuvants function in one or more of the following ways: (1) prolonging retention of the immunogen, (2) increased effective size of the immunogen (and hence promoting phagocytosis and presentation to macrophages), (3) stimulating the influx of macrophage or other immune cells to the injection site, or (4) promoting local cytokine production and other immunologic activities. Example adjuvants include: complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), aluminum salts, and mycobacterial derived proteins such as muramyl di- or tri-peptides.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0102">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; includes monoclonal antibodies (including full length antibodies which have an immunoglobulin Fc region), antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity, multispecific antibodies {e.g., bispecific antibodies, diabodies, and single-chain molecules, as well as antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab&#x2032;)2, and Fv). The term &#x201c;immunoglobulin&#x201d; (Ig) is used interchangeably with &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; herein. The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. An IgM antibody consists of 5 of the basic heterotetramer units along with an additional polypeptide called a J chain, and contains 10 antigen binding sites, while IgA antibodies comprise from 2-5 of the basic 4-chain units which can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages in combination with the J chain. In the case of IgGs, the 4-chain unit is generally about 150,000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to an H chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (V<sub>H</sub>) followed by three constant domains (C<sub>H</sub>) for each of the &#x3b1; and &#x3b3; chains and four C<sub>H </sub>domains for &#x3bc; and &#x3b5; isotypes. Each L chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (V<sub>L</sub>) followed by a constant domain at its other end. The V<sub>L </sub>is aligned with the V<sub>H </sub>and the C<sub>L </sub>is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain (C<sub>H</sub>1). Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>together forms a single antigen-binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see e.g., Basic and Clinical Immunology, 8th Edition, Daniel P. Sties, Abba I. Terr and Tristram G. Parsolw (eds), Appleton &#x26; Lange, Norwalk, Conn., 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6. The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains (C<sub>H</sub>), immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, having heavy chains designated &#x3b1;, &#x3b4;, &#x3b5;, &#x3b3; and &#x3bc;, respectively. The &#x3b3; and &#x3b1; classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor differences in the CH sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following subclasses: IgG1, IgG2A, IgG2B, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgK1.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0103">An &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; antibody is one that has been identified, separated and/or recovered from a component of its production environment (E.g., natural or recombinant). Preferably, the isolated polypeptide is free of association with all other components from its production environment. Contaminant components of its production environment, such as that resulting from recombinant transfected cells, are materials that would typically interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified: (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method, and in some embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight, (1) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0104">Ordinarily, however, an isolated polypeptide or antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0105">The &#x201c;variable region&#x201d; or &#x201c;variable domain&#x201d; of an antibody refers to the amino-terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domains of the heavy chain and light chain may be referred to as &#x201c;VH&#x201d; and &#x201c;VL&#x201d;, respectively. These domains are generally the most variable parts of the antibody (relative to other antibodies of the same class) and contain the antigen binding sites.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0106">The term &#x201c;variable&#x201d; refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen binding and defines the specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed across the entire span of the variable domains. Instead, it is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three HVRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the HVRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al, Sequences of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in the binding of antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0107">The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations and/or post-translation modifications (e.g., isomerizations, amidations) that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler and Milstein., Nature, 256:495-97 (1975); Hongo et al, Hybridoma, 14 (3): 253-260 (1995), Harlow et al, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2<sup>nd </sup>ed. 1988); Hammerling et al, in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N. Y., 1981)), recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), phage-display technologies (see, e.g., Clackson et al, Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991); Marks et al, J.

Rev. Immunol. 13: 65-93 (1995).</p><p id="p-0128" num="0108">An &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; comprises a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding and/or the variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870, Example 2; Zapata et al, Protein Eng. 8HO): 1057-1062 [1995]); single-chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Papain digestion of antibodies produced two identical antigen-binding fragments, called &#x201c;Fab&#x201d; fragments, and a residual &#x201c;Fc&#x201d; fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain (V<sub>H</sub>), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain (C<sub>H</sub>1). Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen-binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having different antigen-binding activity and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. Fab&#x2032; fragments differ from Fab fragments by having a few additional residues at the carboxy terminus of the C<sub>H</sub>1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab&#x2032;-SH is the designation herein for Fab&#x2032; in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab&#x2032; fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0109">The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy-terminal portions of both H chains held together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region, the region which is also recognized by Fc receptors (FcR) found on certain types of cells.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0110">&#x201c;Fv&#x201d; is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody.

In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin sequence, and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence, although the FR regions may include one or more individual FR residue substitutions that improve antibody performance, such as binding affinity, isomerization, immunogenicity, etc. The number of these amino acid substitutions in the FR are typically no more than 6 in the H chain, and in the L chain, no more than 3. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.

For example, an antibody that specifically binds to a target (which can be an epitope) is an antibody that binds this target with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other targets. In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an antibody to an unrelated target is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to the target as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that specifically binds to a target has a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of &#x3c;1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M, &#x3c;1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M, &#x3c;1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M, &#x3c;1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>M, or &#x3c;1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M.

The antibodies &#x201c;arm&#x201d; the cytotoxic cells and are required for killing of the target cell by this mechanism. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc&#x3b3;RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc&#x3b3;RI, Fc&#x3b3;RII and Fc&#x3b3;RIII. Fc expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9: 457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and natural killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al, PNAS USA 95:652-656 (1998). Unless indicated otherwise herein, the numbering of the residues in an immunoglobulin heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al, supra. The &#x201c;EU index as in Kabat&#x201d; refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody. In many cancers the tumor cells express high levels of PD-L1 on their surface. Upon binding to PD-L1 on tumor cells and binding with their fragment crystalline (Fc) part to Fc-gamma receptors (FCGR) on leukocytes, anti-PD-L1 antibodies with ADCC potential can trigger ADCC which may lead to the death of these tumor cells.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0130">The term &#x201c;c region&#x201d; herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain, including native-sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy-chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during production or purification of the antibody, or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly, a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed, antibody populations with no K447 residues removed, and antibody populations having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue. Suitable native-sequence Fc regions for use in the antibodies of the invention include human IgG1, IgG2 (IgG2A, IgG2B), IgG3 and IgG4. &#x201c;c receptor&#x201d; or &#x201c;FcR&#x201d; describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the Fc&#x3b3;RI, Fc&#x3b3;RII, and Fc&#x3b3;RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors, Fc&#x3b3;RII receptors include Fc&#x3b3;RIIA (an &#x201c;activating receptor&#x201d;) and Fc&#x3b3;RIIB (an &#x201c;inhibiting receptor&#x201d;), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc&#x3b3;RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc&#x3b3;RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain, (see M. Daeron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997).

The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer.

Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity, i.e. binding strength are described in the following.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0134">The &#x201c;K<sub>D</sub>&#x201d; or &#x201c;K<sub>D </sub>value&#x201d; according to this invention is in one embodiment measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of the antibody and antigen molecule as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (<sup>125</sup>I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (Chen, et al, (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 ug/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23&#xb0; C.). In a non-adsorbant plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [<sup>125</sup>I]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (consistent with assessment of an anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al, (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature for one hour. The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 ul/well of scintillant (Micro Scint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.

Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N&#x2032;-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 &#x3bc;g/ml (&#x2212;0.2 &#x3bc;M) before injection at a flow rate of 5 &#x3bc;L/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% TWEEN 20&#x2122; surfactant (PBST) at 25&#xb0; C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 &#x3bc;L/min. Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore&#xae; Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. See, e.g., Chen et al, J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881 (1999). If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>by the surface-plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence-emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25&#xb0; C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow-equipped spectrophotometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO&#x2122; spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0135">An &#x201c;on-rate&#x201d; &#x201c;rate of association&#x201d; &#x201c;association rate&#x201d; or &#x201c;k<sub>on</sub>&#x201d; according to this invention can also be determined as described above using a BIACORE&#xa9;-2000 or a BIACORE-3000 system (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25&#xb0; C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at about 10 response units (RU).

In some embodiments, blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen. The anti-PD-1 antibodies of the invention block the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptor PD-1, and thus the signaling through PD-1 so as to restore a functional response by T-cells from a dysfunctional state to antigen stimulation. An &#x201c;agonist&#x201d; or activating antibody is one that enhances or initiates signaling by the antigen to which it binds.

The extent to which an antibody or fragment thereof is able to interfere with the binding of another to the target, and therefore whether it can be said to cross-block or cross-compete according to the invention, can be determined using competition binding assays. One particularly suitable quantitative cross-competition assay uses a FACS- or an AlphaScreen-based approach to measure competition between the labelled (e.g. His tagged, biotinylated or radioactive labelled) an antibody or fragment thereof and the other an antibody or fragment thereof in terms of their binding to the target. In the Experimental Section a suitable assay is described for determining whether a binding molecule cross-competes or is capable of cross-competing with an antibody or fragment thereof. In general, a cross-competing antibody or fragment thereof is for example one which will bind to the target in the cross-competition assay such that, during the assay and in the presence of a second antibody or fragment thereof, the recorded displacement of the immunoglobulin single variable domain or polypeptide according to the invention is up to 100% (e.g. in FACS based competition assay) of the maximum theoretical displacement (e.g. displacement by cold (e.g. unlabeled) antibody or fragment thereof that needs to be cross-blocked) by the to be tested potentially cross-blocking antibody or fragment thereof that is present in a given amount. Preferably, cross-competing antibodies or fragments thereof have a recorded displacement that is between 10% and 100%, more preferred between 50% to 100%.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0143">An &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; nucleic acid molecule encoding the antibodies herein is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the environment in which it was produced. Preferably, the isolated nucleic acid is free of association with all components associated with the production environment. The isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding the polypeptides and antibodies herein is in a form other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature.

The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers. Nucleic acid is &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional A &#x201c;stable&#x201d; formulation is one in which the protein therein essentially retains its physical and chemical stability and integrity upon storage. Various analytical techniques for measuring protein stability are available in the art and are reviewed in Peptide and Protein Drug Delivery, 247-301, Vincent Lee Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., Pubs. (1991) and Jones, A. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 10: 29-90 (1993). Stability can be measured at a selected temperature for a selected time period. For rapid screening, the formulation may be kept at 40&#xb0; C. for 2 weeks to 1 month, at which time stability is measured. Where the formulation is to be stored at 2-8&#xb0; C., generally the formulation should be stable at 30&#xb0; C. or 40&#xb0; C. for at least 1 month and/or stable at 2-8&#xb0; C. for at least 2 years. Where the formulation is to be stored at 30&#xb0; C., generally the formulation should be stable for at least 2 years at 30&#xb0; C. and/or stable at 40&#xb0; C. for at least 6 months. For example, the extent of aggregation during storage can be used as an indicator of protein stability. Thus, a &#x201c;stable&#x201d; formulation may be one wherein less than about 10% and preferably less than about 5% of the protein are present as an aggregate in the formulation. In other embodiments, any increase in aggregate formation during storage of the formulation can be determined.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0145">A &#x201c;reconstituted&#x201d; formulation is one which has been prepared by dissolving a lyophilized protein or antibody formulation in a diluent such that the protein is dispersed throughout.

Isotonic formulations will generally have an osmotic pressure from about 250 to 350 mOsm. The term &#x201c;hypotonic&#x201d; describes a formulation with an osmotic pressure below that of human blood. Correspondingly, the term &#x201c;hypertonic&#x201d; is used to describe a formulation with an osmotic pressure above that of human blood. Isotonicity can be measured using a vapor pressure or ice-freezing type osmometer, for example.

Selection and Improvement of Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0193" num="0172">Antibodies were selected from phage Fab display libraries. The selection included two different arms one utilizing biotinylated human PD-L1 on the different selection rounds and other alternating human and mouse PD-L1 as target on different rounds. 3840 clones were screened by ELISA to identify 170 individual PD-L1 binders. Based on the inhibition of PD-1 ligand binding, 48 hits were selected and were expressed in medium scale for further characterization.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0173">The selected hits were reformatted and expressed as IgGs. Hit optimization candidates were selected based on the potency to block binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 and the ability of binding to both human and mouse versions of PD-L1. Binding to PD-L1 was originally determined by ELISA and later quantified by Biacore and binding to PD-L1 expressing cells by FACS. Four candidates fitted the predefined profile, including A09-188-1 which contained a lambda light chain.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0174">A09-188-1 was chosen for affinity maturation and sequence optimization. The goals of the affinity maturation were increased affinity to the human target, cross-reactivity to the murine target, and improvement of manufacturability. Heavy chain mutations in the HVR's were introduced by codon based randomization. This heavy chain diversity was combined with light chain diversity introduced by light chain shuffling to generate the affinity maturation library. Further heavy and light chain FR and HVR residues were mutated to increase stability of the antibody and introduce amino acids found in the germline, such as the heavy chain FR mutation 193V.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0175">This yielded the HVR sequences given below.

Binding hotspots, or residues that contribute most to the binding energy (Wells. J. A., <i>PNAS </i>93, 1-6, 1996), were identified as those that did not meet a threshold binding signal at 100 nM antigen. Furthermore, the affinity of the antibody for wild-type and each mutant was determined and used to calculate the contribution of each epitope residue to the binding energy.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0219">The results are summarized in the table below, where 48 point mutants of PD-L1 were compared to wild-type PD-L1 antigen for antibody binding. SPR (Biacore) was used to perform a kinetic study allowing determination of kinetic rate constants (k<sub>a </sub>and k<sub>d</sub>). Briefly, goat polyclonal anti-human Fc antibody was chemically coupled to a CM5 chip. A11-128 was injected next and captured by the polyclonal. Buffer was used to wash out unbound antibody until the baseline RU stabilized. Antigen (wild-type or mutant PD-L1) was next injected at a fixed concentration for 3 minutes and the association was recorded. Buffer was injected for a further 3 minutes and dissociation was observed. The antigens were injected at concentrations of 100 nM, 50 nM, 25 nM, 12.5 nM and 6.25 nM (except for Y56 and D61 mutants, which were injected at 1 uM, 500 nM, 250 nM, 125 nM and 62.5 nM). Between each cycle, the chip was regenerated with low pH buffer and fresh A09-246-2 was captured prior to injecting the next concentration of antigen. The rate constants were determined by iterative fitting of the data to a 1:1 binding model by an algorithm that minimizes Chi-squared. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) was calculated as the ratio of the kinetic constants and the change in the Gibbs free energy of binding of mutant relative to wild-type PD-L1 (&#x394;&#x394;G<sub>mut</sub>) was derived from the ratio of the wild-type and mutant K<sub>D</sub>s. The free energy changes are highlighted according to destabilization of antibody-antigen binding; &#x201c;**&#x201d;: &#x3e;3 kcal/mol destabilization (binding hotspots); &#x201c;*&#x201d;: &#x3e;0.7 kcal/mol. Mutants at Y56 had such a low affinity that the K<sub>D </sub>could be accurately measured and the minimum K<sub>D </sub>is given instead. For D61A no binding could be found. According to this analysis, amino acids marked with &#x201c;**&#x201d; or &#x201c;*&#x201d; are part of the functional epitope.

The structural integrity of the mutated proteins was confirmed using a fluorescence monitored thermal unfolding assay in which the protein is incubated with a dye that is quenched in aqueous solution but fluoresces when bound by exposed hydrophobic residues. As the temperature increases, thermal denaturation of the protein exposes the hydrophobic core residues and this can be monitored by an increase in fluorescence of the dye. Mutants of Y56 or D61 all display a two state transition similar to wild-type PD-L1, indicating a folded structure at room temperature. The data were fit to equation 1 (adapted from Bullock, A. N. et al. Thermodynamic stability of wild-type and mutant p53 core domain. <i>PNAS </i>94, 14338-14342 (1997)) to determine the temperature at the inflection point of the curve (T<sub>1/2</sub>).</p><p

To confirm the proposed mechanism of action (MOA), a study was conducted in MC38 tumor bearing mice that were systemically depleted of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In animals depleted of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy was completely abrogated, confirming that cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) effector function is responsible for the inhibition of tumor growth. To evaluate the combination potential of anti-PD-L1 therapy, combination partners were selected known to elicit anti-tumor T cell responses or otherwise enhance the effects of immunotherapy. In combination with fractionated radiotherapy against MC38 tumors, the anti-PD-L1 antibody showed strong synergistic activity, with curative potential. Combination with a single low-dose of cyclophosphamide resulted in enhanced anti-tumor effects in the MC-38 model that were associated with an increased frequency of tumor-antigen specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Anti-PD-L1 therapy significantly extended survival time when combined with Gemcitabine in the PANC02 orthotopic tumor model of pancreatic cancer. When anti-PD-L1 was combined with cyclophosphamide pre-treatment followed by vaccination with Stimuvax, a significant increase in tumor growth inhibition was achieved in both the MC38/MUC1 and PANC02/MUC1 tumor models. Significantly enhanced efficacy was also observed when the anti-PD-L1 antibody was combined with the core components of the FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen. Thus, several promising combination approaches for anti-PD-L1 therapy were successfully identified, including three &#x201c;standard of care&#x201d; treatment regimens (radiation therapy; FOLFOX; Gemcitabine).</p><p id="p-0254" num="0231">Mechanistic data derived from these studies demonstrated that anti-PD-L1 therapy is consistently associated with increased percentages of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T effector memory cells, and PD-1CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleens and tumors of treated mice.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0000">4.1 Dose-Response in MC38 Tumor Model and Combination with CPA</p><p id="p-0256" num="0232">In this study, mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>MC38 colon carcinoma cells. When tumors reached a mean volume of &#x2212;50 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were sorted into treatment groups (N=14) (defined as study day 0). Groups were administered A09-246-2 intravenously at dose levels of 100, 200, 400, or 800 &#x3bc;g on days 0, 3, and 6. A control group was treated with 200 &#x3bc;g of an inactive isotype antibody. Tumors were measured twice weekly for the study duration. All treatment groups demonstrated significant efficacy (P&#x3c;0.050) when compared to the isotype control group. Although the 800 &#x3bc;g dose group did not show enhanced efficacy over the 400 &#x3bc;g group, a significant trend toward a dose-dependent effect was observed. In a second dose-response study that followed the same design, a general trend toward dose-dependent activity was again observed. However, the 800 &#x3bc;g dose group in that particular study showed significantly lower anti-tumor activity than did the 400 &#x3bc;g dose group. The lack of increased efficacy at doses above 400 &#x3bc;g may indicate an efficacy plateau as a result of target saturation, or a stronger immunogenic effect may occur at higher doses, resulting in lower drug exposure. Additionally, these studies explored the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 in combination with pre-treatment with a low, immunomodulatory dose of cyclophosphamide (CPA). The CPA combination was observed to significantly improve the efficacy of low doses of anti-PD-L1 (100 &#x3bc;g), and this effect was associated with increased frequencies of p15E tumor antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as determined by ELISPOT.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0233">Immunophenotyping data from these studies revealed that anti-PD-L1 therapy is associated with significantly increased percentages of various CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets in spleens: total CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, p15E tumor antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, PD-1CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T effector memory (T<sub>EM</sub>) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>) cells. Increased intratumoral accumulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM </sub>cells was also observed. These observations support htat anti-PD-L1 therapy as an effective strategy for driving anti-tumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses.</p><heading id="h-0033" level="2">4.2 Efficacy in C1498/GFP Disseminated Leukemia Model</heading><p id="p-0258" num="0234">To create the disseminated leukemia model, C4198-GFP leukemia cells (2&#xd7;10<sup>4</sup>) were injected i.v. into C57BL/6 mice on day 0. Mice were then randomized into treatment groups (N=5) that received either a 400 &#x3bc;g dose of anti-PD-L1 Ab (A09-246-2) or an equivalent dose of an inactive isotype antibody on days 1, 4, and 7 by i.p. injection. The primary endpoint of this study was survival based on the onset of clinical signs, indicative of metastatic dissemination, which warranted euthanasia. At the end of the study (day 76), 20% of mice (&#x2155;) were still alive in the isotype antibody treated group, and 80% (&#x2158;) survivors remained in the A09-246-2 treated group.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0000">4.3 Combination with Gemcitabine in the PANC02 Orthotopic Model</p><p id="p-0260" num="0235">Three separate studies were conducted to investigate the combination of the anti-PD-L1 MAb (A09-246-2) and Gemcitabine (GEM). The studies were designed to explore the positioning of anti-PD-L1 therapy within the chemotherapy &#x201c;holiday&#x201d; period of a 21 day or 28 day cycle of GEM. Orthotopic models involve the inoculation of tumor cells into the organ of origin, resulting in a close recapitulation of disease progression as it occurs in the human setting. To create a model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, PANC02 cells (1&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>) were injected into the pancreas of C57BL/6 female mice. Five days later, mice were randomized into treatment groups. GEM was dosed at 150 mg/kg in all studies and A09-246-2 was dosed at 400 &#x3bc;g per mouse. In two studies, a 28 day cycle of GEM was modeled (administration on days 5, 19, 26), with a 14 day holiday period during which A09-246-2 was given on days 8, 11, 14. In a third study, a 21 day cycle of GEM was modeled (administration on days 5, 12, 26, 33), with a 14 day holiday period during which A09-246-2 was given on days 13, 16, 19. Monotherapy with GEM or anti-PD-L1 failed to extend survival time in this model. However, in all three studies, the combination of GEM and A09-246-2 significantly extended mean survival time (P&#x3c;0.02). Immunophenotyping revealed several effects in groups receiving A09-246-2, both as a monotherapy and in combination with GEM, that were consistent with the proposed MOA of anti-PD-L1 including increased percentages of CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM </sub>in spleens, an increased ratio of splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM </sub>to T<sub>reg </sub>cells, and increased percentages of splenic PD-1<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells. Furthermore, immunophenotyping of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) showed significantly increased percentages of CD8<sup>+</sup> TIL in the combination group.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0000">4.4 Combination with Low Dose Cyclophosphamide (CPA)</p><p id="p-0262" num="0236">Low-dose CPA is known to enhance anti-tumor immune responses through the inhibition of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. The potential for low-dose CPA pre-treatment was investigated to enhance the efficacy of the anti-PD-L1 Ab (A09-246-2) in the MC38 subcutaneous tumor model. Mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>MC38 colon carcinoma cells. When tumors reached a mean volume of &#x2dc;50 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were sorted into treatment groups (N=14) on day 0. The combination group received 100 &#x3bc;g of A09-246-2 by i.v. injection on days 0, 3, and 6, with or without pre-treatment with a 100 mg/kg dose of CPA delivered i.v. on day &#x2212;1. A control treatment group received 100 &#x3bc;g of an inactive isotype antibody in combination with CPA pretreatment. The combination treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant enhancement (p&#x3c;0.050) of anti-tumor activity when compared against the isotype and monotherapy control groups. Using an ELISPOT assay, the effects of treatment on the magnitude of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses directed against the well-characterized p15E tumor antigen were measured. Both CPA and A09-246-2 showed substantially increased levels of p15E-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (&#x2dc;100 spots in both groups) when compared to the isotype control (&#x2dc;25 spots), with the combination group showing a further enhancement (&#x2dc;250 spots). Thus, the anti-tumor efficacy of the CPA plus A09-246-2 combination was associated with increased frequencies of tumor-antigen reactive CTL.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0000">4.5 Combination with Cyclophosphamide/Stimuvax</p><p id="p-0264" num="0237">The ability of PD-L1 blockade to restore anti-tumor T cell responses provides a strong rationale for combination with cancer vaccines. Stimuvax is a vaccine against the human MUC1 antigen, which is commonly overexpressed by solid tumors. Mice transgenic for the human MUC1 protein (MUC1.tg mice) are immunologically tolerant of the antigen, and, when inoculated with murine tumors that also express human MUC1, provide a relevant model of the clinical vaccination setting. In the clinic, cyclophosphamide (CPA) pre-treatment is used in combination with Stimuvax as a strategy for transiently depleting immunosuppressive T<sub>reg </sub>cells that can inhibit the vaccine response.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0238">In this study, MUC1.tg mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the right rear flank with 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>MC38/MUC1 colon carcinoma cells. Five days after tumor cell inoculation, mice were randomized into treatment groups (N=10) on day &#x2212;3. On day &#x2212;3, a 100 mg/kg dose of CPA was administered by i.v. administration. Vaccination was initiated on day 0 and was repeated weekly. Anti-PD-L1 Ab (A09-246-2) was dosed by i.p. injection on days 0, 3, and 6. Tumors were measured twice weekly. The combination of CPA/Stimuvax and A09-246-2 demonstrated significantly enhanced (p&#x3c;0.050) tumor growth inhibition when compared against treatment with CPA/Stimuvax.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0239">In a second study, 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>PANC02/MUC1 cells were inoculated into the pancreas of MUC1.tg mice. Four days later, mice were randomized into groups (N=8) and treatment was initiated. The same treatment schedule was applied as for the first study. The combination of CPA/Stimuvax and anti-PD-L1 (A09-246-2) significantly increased mean survival time (MST) when compared against treatment with CPA/Stimuvax (MST of 43.5 days vs. 70 days, P=0.0001). Immunophenotyping by FACS showed a significant trend towards increased percentages of CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM </sub>and CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM </sub>in the combination group.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0000">4.6 Combination with Fractionated Radiotherapy</p><p id="p-0268" num="0240">Radiotherapy (RT) has been demonstrated to enhance the immunogenicity of tumor cells, through increased expression of MHC class I and diversification of the intracellular peptide pool. To test anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment in combination with radiotherapy, MC38 colon carcinoma cells (1&#xd7;10<sup>5</sup>) were inoculated intramuscularly into the right quadriceps of C57BL/6 female mice. When tumors reached a mean volume of 150 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were sorted into treatment groups (N=8) on day 0. The tumor-bearing legs were isolated and treated with 360 cGy of gamma irradiation from a cesium-137 source on days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (total dose of 1800 cGy). Anti-PD-L1 Ab (A09-246-2) was dosed i.v. at 400 &#x3bc;g on days 3, 6, and 9. The A09-246-2 and radiotherapy combination resulted in a high rate of tumor regressions, ultimately leading to 6/10 complete responses (CR). Mice with CR were re-challenged by inoculation of MC38 tumor cells, and 3/6 mice remained tumor-free seventy-four days after the re-challenge, indicating that effective immune memory was generated by the combination therapy. Conversely, a control group treated with an isotype control antibody in combination with radiation showed significant tumor growth inhibition, but did not induce regressions.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0241">A repeat of the RT and anti-PD-L1 (A09-246-2) combination study was performed, with the inclusion of a second combination therapy group in which the mice were systemically depleted of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Additional immunological readouts measured in this study included FACS-based immunophenotyping of splenocytes, in vivo proliferation analysis, and ELISPOT assay. Again, the combination demonstrated synergistic efficacy that induced an initial phase of regression or stasis in all of the tumors. However, complete regression was only observed in &#x215b; mice, with one other mouse experiencing a prolonged period of tumor stasis. Depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells completely abrogated the synergy of the combination, confirming that the mechanism involves the stimulation of anti-tumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. This observation was further supported by increased frequencies of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells reactive to the p15E tumor antigen. Immunophenotyping by FACS revealed increased percentages of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation in spleens, and increased splenic percentages of CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM </sub>and CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub>.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0000">4.7 Combination with Core Components of the FOLFOX Regimen</p><p id="p-0271" num="0242">FOLFOX is a combination chemotherapy regimen, consisting of folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and oxaliplatin (OX), used in the treatment of stage Ill colorectal cancer. The potential for combining anti-PD-L1 with the core components of FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) in the subcutaneous MC38 colon carcinoma model were studied. Mice were inoculated in the right subcutaneous flank with 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>MC38 colon carcinoma cells. When tumors reached a mean volume of &#x2dc;50 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were sorted into treatment groups (N=10) on day 0.5-FU (60 mg/kg i.v.) and OX (5 mg/kg i.p.) were administered on days 0 and 14. Anti-PD-L1 Ab (A09-246-2) (400 &#x3bc;g i.v.) was given on days 3, 6, and 9. The combination treatment was observed to have significantly greater efficacy (p&#x3c;0.050) when compared to A09-246-2 given alone, or 5-FU and OX given in combination with an isotype antibody. A repeat of the anti-PD-L1 Ab and FOLFOX combination study was performed and, again, the combination demonstrated significantly greater (p&#x3c;0.050) anti-tumor activity than either of the monotherapy regimens. FACS-based immunophenotyping conducted in these studies revealed increases in several immunological markers consistent with a CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell driven MOA, including increased splenic levels of p15E tumor antigen specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, an increase in the splenic ratio of T<sub>EM </sub>to regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub>), and increased splenic percentages of CD8*PD-1<sup>+</sup> T cells.
